      "When he was 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018I do now an exhibition against the war.\u2019 This I don\u2019t do because this is a program; I\u2019m not a programmatic artist,\" he said. \"I do what is in me, what has to come out. And that is about all kinds of things, about the dead, about the war.\u201d",
      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

      "Amazon says the program will take a hybrid approach, allowing \u201clocal processionals to collaborate with AI to ensure quality control.\u201d",
      "Other tech companies have also introduced AI-powered dubbing into their platforms. Last year, YouTube released a feature that allows content creators to translate their videos into multiple languages. Meta, meanwhile, said in September that it was testing an AI tool that will automatically translate voices in Reels."

      "\u201cIf you have already paid for your prom tickets, they will reimburse you for your prom tickets. It\u2019s a pretty good deal,\u201d Carell said.",
      "The Los Angeles area fires destroyed more than 16,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killed at least 29 people in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood and Altadena area north of Pasadena. It also scorched school campuses, upending the lives of thousands of students and parents who were left scrambling looking for classrooms for their kids to go to.",
      "Alice's Kids will donate about $175,000 for more than 800 students to attend the annual right-of-passage dance for graduating students. Tickets typically range from $100 to $150 each.",
      "\u201cGoing to prom should be a celebration, and we wanted to help make the big night just a little easier for seniors whose lives have been turned upside down by the wildfires,\u201d Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of Alice\u2019s Kids, said in a statement. \u201cHopefully this allows the students to unwind and have some fun after a devasting year.\u201d",

      "Carell also participated in the star-studded \u201cSkate for LA Strong\u201d hockey tournament last week to raise money for fire relief.",
      "In closing, the actor said: \u201cHave fun, enjoy the prom. And remember, this is Steve Carell.\u201d"

      "PARIS -- Doja Cat took her front-row seat at Balmain\u2019s fall show at Paris Fashion Week, fresh off her appearance at the Oscars in a custom beaded Balmain gown. But on the runway, designer Olivier Rousteing shifted from red carpet opulence to a new kind of luxury, built on sculptural knitwear, fluid draping and dazzling blown-up zebra motifs.",
      "The Wednesday night collection opened with a now-familiar silhouette from Rousteing \u2014 a swooping hooded sweater, this time paired with a leather peplum and relaxed leather trousers. Knitwear remained the focus \u2014 draped mohair, wool jersey dresses and cocooning sweaters gave the collection a sense of ease.",
      "The monochrome \u201cgroutfit\u201d made a strong showing, broken up by the rich textural play of pleats, ruched tops and embossed leathers that kept the palette from falling flat.",
      "That softness found its counterbalance in statement hardware and a flash of animalistic energy. Chunky bracelets, talon earrings and that bold, graphic zebra motif, paired with oversized coats and slouchy boots reminded us this was still Balmain.",
      "The footwear was a standout. Sculpturally twisted pumps and fuzzy or buttery-soft leather boots injected a playful contrast into the collection\u2019s rhythm of black, white and bursts of citrus orange.",
      "Though the emphasis on draping and ease was a shift, the Balmain DNA shone through in the accessories. Rousteing\u2019s experiment with volume felt like a recalibration rather than a reinvention, proving once again that luxury isn\u2019t just about excess, but knowing when to let the clothes breathe."

      "PARIS -- The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court.",
      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks. The online attacks erupted after Jolly\u2019s acclaimed but controversial opening spectacle on the Seine in July \u2014 a queer-inclusive, high-energy fusion of tradition and modernity.",
      "Local media reported that Jolly did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing, with two of the people charged also not attending because they were either sick or could not make themselves available.",
      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",
      "The arrests were seen as a first step in France\u2019s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities noted has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly\u2019s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing \u201cpack behavior\u201d of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns.",
      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "Festival organizers announced the lineup on Thursday, including the headline acts, for arguably the world\u2019s most famous music festival. This year, it will take place at Worthy Farm from June 25 to June 29.",

      "Neil Young, the legendary 79-year-old Canadian-American singer-songwriter, was previously announced as the headliner for the Saturday night, while his Scottish peer Rod Stewart had been confirmed for the coveted legends slot on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Not making the top of the bill, but very much in vogue and likely to draw huge crowds, is Charli XCX, who will perform on the Other Stage on the Saturday night. Last week, the singer behind the \u201cBrat summer\" phenomenon, won five Brit awards.",
      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",
      "Closing out the Other Stage on the festival's Sunday night will be English electronic group The Prodigy, most famous for the pumping 1996 track \u201cFirestarter.\" The performance will be particularly poignant as it will mark the band's first at the festival since the death of frontman Keith Flint in 2019.",
      "Other acts include Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut, and the recently reformed U.S. pop group Scissor Sisters.",
      "There are no scheduled performers on the festivals first two days, Wednesday and Thursday, though many ad hoc events take place as attendees arrive and pitch up their tents.",

      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",

      "Lady Gaga rediscovered her passion for music through self-discovery, channeling her personal transformation into her new album \u201cMayhem.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When Lady Gaga walked into a New York City bar she frequented five years ago, the memories hit hard: Back then, she wrote songs there, feeling lost and disconnected from herself.",
      "But this time was different. While sitting in the bar, Gaga felt a sense of peace and rejuvenation, reminiscent of her teenage years spent scribbling lyrics on napkins.",
      "In recent years, Gaga rediscovered her passion for music by taking a step back from the limelight, cutting ties from fake friendships, swapping the spotlight for quiet nights at home and surrounding herself with people she truly trusts. That personal transformation became the soul of her new album, \u201cMayhem,\u201d which is being released Friday.",
      "\u201cI reclaimed myself as an artist,\u201d said Gaga, a 14-time Grammy and one-time Oscar winner who returned to her dark pop music roots on the album, which spans 14 tracks. Her new project follows last year\u2019s \u201c Harlequin,\u201d a jazz-inspired companion album for the film \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d which stalled at No. 20 on the Billboard 200.",
      "But Gaga's singles for the 14-track \u201cMayhem\u201d have been received well on the charts, including \u201c Disease,\u201d \u201c Abracadabra \u201d and \u201c Die With a Smile,\u201d a collaboration with Bruno Mars, spending five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1 and winning a Grammy for best pop duo/group performance earlier this month.",
      "While recording \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga refused to rest on her past hits or accolades to define her new work. She credited her renewed creative drive to a journey of self-discovery, which ultimately empowered her to step back into the spotlight for several big moments last month. The superstar performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys \u2014 including a tribute song \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\u201d to Los Angeles wildfire victims, closed out the FireAid benefit concert with \u201cAll I Need is Time\u201d and delivered a surprise performance singing \u201cHold My Hand\u201d before the Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "Next month, Gaga will headline Coachella and perform a free concert on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Copacabana Beach in May.",
      "\u201cI built a routine in my daily life around music all the time, and not around self-promotion,\u201d said Gaga, 38, who was a producer and co-executive producer with her fianc\u00e9 Michael Polansky, 41, on \u201cMayhem.\u201d \u201cWhen my life was circulating self-promotion, I think I lost a lot of my passion. When my life was around my family, my partner and my music, it gave me back that realness.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Gaga digs deeper into what it took to regain her passion, showing she's more than just a character and her pulling double duty on \u201cSaturday Night Live\" on Saturday.",
      "While Gaga was dropping early hits like \u201cJust Dance\u201d and \u201cPoker Face,\u201d she noticed critics who downplayed her role in the success, giving more credit to producers and even stylists.",
      "With \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga aimed to showcase that her talent was the true driving force behind her rise. Fueled by the skeptics, the singer is determined to show she's the architect of her success, not just another industry creation.",
      "\u201cThey tried to qualify and quantify me,\u201d she said. \u201cVery often as a woman in music, they say it was other people. You\u2019re a product, like you were made. Something that was really important to me on this was really taking from myself my own inventions.\u201d",
      "When Gaga began recording her new album, she focused on crafting the kind of dark pop melodies that defined her early career, pairing them with lyrics that spoke in code. She said it all came back naturally, giving her reassurance that she was on the right path to fully owning her identity as an artist instead of a made-up character",
      "\u201cThis was a way for me actually to feel like I wasn\u2019t. That it was the real me,\u201d she said. \"I was the creator. This was my work. It was just not a character I was playing. It was something that I made.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, fame came with a price that Gaga wasn't willing to pay. She felt isolated, trapped in transactional relationships and struck in an environment that prioritized competition over creativity.",
      "The spotlight began to feel like an endless race, draining her passion for making music. She began to notice a shift as her sales climbed beyond the first 10 million records.",
      "Gaga realized that staying in that energy would ultimately stifle her creativity, knowing it was time to break free.",
      "\u201cI lost the thing that I would teach my child, which is to sit alone with your thoughts and write a poem,\" Gaga said. \"Sit alone and write a song. Just put good old-fashioned hard work and craftsmanship into what you believe in. I lost that for a long time.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Gaga hit reset. She cut loose draining relationships and building a stable family with Michael Polansky and their beloved dogs.",
      "It helped Gaga channel her energy back into her artistry.",
      "\u201cThis is the first day I\u2019ve done interviews without makeup on, and it\u2019s nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI just get to share with you about my experience with music, and I\u2019m not feeling pressure to perform for you in any other way than as a female artist.\u201d",
      "In her appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Gaga will showcase her range as both the musical guest and host. But her versatility might shine even brighter in the show\u2019s sketch comedy skits.",
      "\u201cI get to work in all different kinds of art that I love so much,\u201d said Gaga, who will make her second appearance as \u201cSNL\u201d host and fifth as its musical guest. The first time she appeared as host and musical guest was in 2013.",
      "Gaga performed during the \u201c SNL50: The Homecoming Concert \u201d last month.",
      "\u201cDoing \u2018SNL\u2019 is all about hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor of love for the audience on Saturday night because we just want everybody to feel happy at home.\u201d",
      "To prepare, Gaga is synching up with the cast and building rapport, which she says will help balance her roles throughout the night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just be like really close with the cast,\u201d she said. \u201cThey write like all the sketches and they work like all week long on planning, so I feel like the better my relationship is with them and just like getting in there and being one of them, the better the show will be.\u201d",
      "Gaga added: \u201cI\u2019m treating my musical performances separately. I have to wear like a few different hats. There\u2019s hosting and then there\u2019s being the actor in the sketch, and being the artist that I am in my music. I\u2019m ready to do it though.\u201d"

      "\u201cYou guys, you have to pick your plateau. Get serious about everything,\u201d said Ayers.

      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when attendees can let down their hair after hours, and generally speaking, it\u2019s a lower stakes red carpet and less formal event than the ceremony itself,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNext-to-naked dressing matches that energy.\u201d"

      "Once he got inside, Chalamet's grin grew even bigger as he was surrounded with love on all sides at the Beverly Hills bash that is the most luminescent of the post-Oscar parties, where winners and losers alike kicked up their heels, downed champagne and ate In-N-Out Burger late Sunday and early Monday to celebrate the end of a long night and a long awards season.",
      "Changed out of the bright yellow tuxedo he wore to the ceremony into a simpler white shirt and black suit, Chalamet hugged his girlfriend's sisters, Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, who had awaited his arrival from the ceremony. He put his phone to his ear and struggled to hear over the thumping bass, but then waved over an arriving Kylie Jenner, who joined him with a kiss.",
      "Chris Rock was indignant on Chalamet's behalf, loudly declaring he was robbed when he didn't win for playing Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d as the two posed for a picture.",

      "When Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Last fall, Sean Baker was sitting in a Manhattan restaurant, talking about a poll. The survey, about sex in movies and television, showed that Gen Z moviegoers were mostly turned off by sex in film.",
      "\u201cThat broke my heart. I thought, there\u2019s something wrong here,\u201d said Baker. \u201cYou\u2019re OK with all the violence that\u2019s out there? Sex is a vital part of existence. Why don\u2019t you want to see sex in our stories?\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember being on set and being like: We\u2019re pushing against that poll.\u201d",
      "When Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner. \u201cAnora,\u201d about an erotic dancer (Mikey Madison, the best actress winner ) who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, is atypically sexually explicit for a best picture winner \u2014 a class that includes more staid movies like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d A young woman\u2019s relationship to her own sexuality has not been, historically speaking, in the Oscars' wheelhouse.",
      "But that\u2019s just one quality that makes \u201cAnora\u201d unique as a best picture winner. The film, made for $6 million and distributed by Neon, was made with little interest in the mainstream. If anything, \u201cAnora\u201d was more oriented to the Cannes Film Festival, the French citadel of cinema, where it won the Palme d\u2019Or last May \u2014 a prize that Baker said meant the most to him.",
      "But, increasingly, these are converging movie worlds. In the last five years, four Palme d\u2019Or winners have been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d (also distributed by Neon), which became the first non-English language movie to win Hollywood\u2019s top prize.",
      "\u201cAnora,\u201d a film that inverts a Hollywood fairy tale like \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d is \u2014 like many of the winners on Sunday \u2014 an unabashedly modern movie and a film comfortable, even proud of the label of \u201ccinema.\u201d In a movie industry where manufactured franchise stewardship rules the day, \u201cAnora\u201d was celebrated, in part, because it's the real deal.",
      "It's also a more traditional choice than it might seem. Baker, a filmmaker who has sworn off making a series, a studio film or anything for streaming, is an apostle of '70s cinema. At an Oscars that host Conan O\u2019Brien called \u201cthe 97th Longform Content Awards,\u201d \u201cAnora\u201d \u2014 which shared some of the same Brooklyn streets as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d \u2014 stood for upholding an increasingly threatened theatrical legacy, with Baker ardently defending a very old-fashioned thing: the big screen.",
      "\u201cFilmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will,\u201d Baker said from the Dolby Theatre stage. \u201cDistributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of your films. Parents, introduce your children to feature films in movie theaters and you will be molding the next generation of movie lovers and filmmakers. And for all of us, when we can please watch movies in a theater and let\u2019s keep the great tradition of the moviegoing experience alive and well.\u201d",
      "The coronation of \u201cAnora\u201d was a triumph for independent moviemaking, but that\u2019s also been a battle waged and won before. We\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d best \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d defeat \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Last year\u2019s crowning of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was, if anything, an exception in a string of smaller best pictures that haven't fit the Oscar mold. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2023 winner, was antic, lewd and about the furthest thing possible from \u201cOscar bait.\u201d",
      "What was different this year was that the stiffest competition for \u201cAnora\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d or any other studio product. It was \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d All of the major award winners on Sunday hailed from movies made independently. At the Oscars, the studios are out of the picture.",
      "That trend has been developing for years, but the 97th Academy Awards showed just how much things have changed. In the best animated category, where Universal and DreamWorks\u2019 \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d was the heavy favorite, \u201cFlow,\u201d a wordless Latvian movie made with open-source software, triumphed instead.",
      "\u201cAny kid now has tools that are used to make these now Academy-winning films,\u201d \u201cFlow\u201d director Gints Zilbalodis said backstage. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to see all kinds of exciting films being made from kids who might not have had a chance to do this before.\u201d",
      "That win, like those for \u201cAnora,\u201d suggested the academy\u2019s international voters have emerged as a dominant bloc. When the academy, reacting to pressure to diversify its ranks, brought in new members in recent years, it cast a wide net overseas. Hundreds of new international voters \u2014 people more likely to favor what succeeds in Cannes or Venice \u2014 now significantly sway the Oscars.",
      "What does that mean for the Academy Awards going forward? A further tilt toward indie and arthouse cinema will surely alienate some viewers. \u201cAnora,\u201d with $16 million in domestic ticket sales, is one of the lowest-grossing best picture winners ever. Oscar producers did everything they could to lean into bigger films, opening with a lavish medley by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, cutting repeatedly to a mascot sandworm from \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and even paying James Bond tribute.",
      "The 007 musical number was oddly timed, coming on the heels of the franchise\u2019s creative takeover by Amazon MGM Studios after decades of Broccoli family stewardship. It seemed to only highlight how much of Hollywood\u2019s regular, day-to-day business of brand management lay outside the new Oscar landscape.",
      "But just as assuredly as an \u201cAnora\u201d Academy Awards might turn some away, it could also inspire a new generation of cinephiles. \u201cAnora\u201d is at turns screwball farce, neorealistic drama, capitalism satire and devastating tragicomedy. It\u2019s arguably one of the best best picture winners of recent years, a movie that tries on nearly every genre before concluding in an unforgettable scene that catapults \u201cAnora\u201d into something classic and outside of time.",
      "What aftershocks will follow Baker's Oscar romp remains to be seen. But shortly after the Academy Awards concluded, 3.9 magnitude tremors were felt in nearby Burbank \u2014 a fitting coda for the small quake of \u201cAnora.\u201d"

      "AL-TUWANEH, West Bank -- Just last week, Israeli troops came and tore down a Palestinian family\u2019s shed in this remote, hilly corner of the West Bank, residents say. It was the latest instance of destruction targeting a collection of hamlets whose population is threatened with expulsion.",
      "Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta area cheered the Oscar win of the documentary \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts life in the beleaguered community, and hoped it will bring them some help.",
      "In al-Tuwaneh, one of the hamlets that make up Masafer Yatta, Salem Adra said his family stayed up all night for the Oscar ceremony. They watched as his older brother, Basel Adra, the film\u2019s co-director, came on stage to accept the award for best documentary.",
      "\u201cIt was such a huge surprise, such joy,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d follows Basel Adra as he risks arrest to document the destruction of Masafer Yatta at the southern edge of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, joined by his co-director, Israeli journalist and filmmaker, Yuval Abraham.",
      "The joint Palestinian-Israeli production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. Five years in the making, it gained greater resonance amid Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in Gaza that forced almost its entire population from their homes, as well as increasing raids in the West Bank that have caused the displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "At the same time, the film has raised hackles in Israel, scarred by the bloody the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war.",
      "Salem Adra, who at times helped his brother film for the movie, said he hoped the Oscar win \u201copens the world\u2019s eyes to what\u2019s happening here in Masafer Yatta.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win for all of Palestine and for everyone who lives in Masafer Yatta,\u201d he said.",
      "He said that since the film was first released, threats and pressure against his family have increased. Their car has been stoned by settlers. After the movie won an award at the Berlin International Film Festival a year ago, the military returned over and over to the family home, and once detained his father, searching his phone and asking, \u201cWhy are you filming?\u201d",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Israel said the Bedouin did not have permanent structures in the area. But families say they have lived and herded their sheep and goats across the area long before Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After a 20-year legal battle by residents, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the expulsion order in 2022. The around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but troops regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2013 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Salem Adra said the latest destruction came Wednesday, when troops tore down the shed of a family in a nearby hamlet.",
      "Standing on a stony ridge above al-Tuwaneh, Salem Adra said Jewish settlers backed by the military have set up 10 outposts around the village since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Shepherd Raed al-Hamamdeh, 48, led his herd of goats across the rocky land. He pointed to one outpost \u2013 with tents and a trailer flying the flag of an Israeli military unit \u2013 on the other side of a small valley. Farmers no longer tend the olive grove in the valley for fear of being attacked.",
      "Al-Hamamdeh said the military uses drones to drive off herds if they get too close to the outposts. \u201cSettlers attack. When we herd sheep, we can\u2019t go far as you can see. Only up to this point can we reach,\u201d he said. He pointed to the rubble of a house that he said settlers had destroyed, driving out the family and burning their furniture.",
      "In Israel, the film garnered little media attention since its release \u2014 and what attention it did get has been angry. When it won the documentary prize at the Berlin festival, its Israeli director Abraham came under fire for an acceptance speech that called for an end to the war in Gaza without mentioning Hamas\u2019 initial attack and taking of the hostages held in Gaza.",
      "In his Oscar acceptance speech, Abraham spoke of both. But that did little to calm criticism in Israel. Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called the win \u201ca sad moment for the world of cinema.\u201d He said the film distorted reality and accused its creators of using \u201cdefamation\u201d of Israel as a way help promote the documentary.",
      "Usually, Israeli films that are nominated for prestigious international prizes receive boastful accolades in Israel.",
      "But after the Hamas attack, \u201ceveryone is in mourning or in trauma, we can hardly hear any other voice on any other subject,\u201d Raya Morag, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who specializes in cinema and trauma, said last week.",
      "On Monday, she said it wasn\u2019t yet clear if the win will bring the documentary more attention in Israel. But, she said, \u201cit won\u2019t be possible for people to ignore the message of the two directors, including for people that haven\u2019t seen the film.\u201d",
      "In his acceptance speech Sunday night, Basel Adra called on the world \u201cto stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.\u201d",
      "He said he hoped his newborn daughter would \u201cnot have to live the same life I am living now \u2026 Always feeling settler violence, home demolitions and forceful displacement.\u201d",
      "On Monday, his brother Salem walked down from the ridge along with his 4-year-old son to a family home.",
      "He checked the CCTV cameras the family has set up around the house to watch for settlers. They were still filming.",

      "EDINA, Minn. -- Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Molland was the last to join and had been the last survivor from the most famous lineup of the group, which recorded for the Beatles \u2019 Apple label. His death was confirmed Tuesday by Sam Sheffield-West, the funeral director at Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels in Edina, Minnesota. Molland had lived in the state for decades. Additional details about his death weren't immediately available.",
      "Badfinger was a quartet that also included singer-guitarist Pete Ham, bassist Tom Evans and drummer Tom Gibbins. They were among the first acts signed to Apple after the Beatles launched it in 1968 and would remain closely associated with the Beatles \u2014 not always to Badfinger's liking \u2014 throughout their brief years of success. Molland even grew up near Liverpool's Penny Lane, immortalized in the Beatles song of the same name.",
      "Badfinger's breakout hit, \u201cCome and Get It,\u201d was written and produced by Paul McCartney, and another top 10 single, \u201cDay After Day,\u201d was produced by George Harrison and featured Harrison's slide guitar. \u201cNo Matter What\u201d was produced by Apple official/Beatles assistant Mal Evans, and another Badfinger song, \u201cWithout You,\u201d became a hit for Beatles friend Harry Nilsson. Molland and his bandmates would also appear at Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for Bangladesh and provide backing on two Beatles member's solo albums: Harrison's \u201cAll Things Must Pass\u201d and John Lennon's \u201cImagine.\u201d",
      "Critics could not stop likening Badfinger's catchy melodies, layered harmonies and tight arrangements to their benefactors: \u201cIt\u2019s as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger,\" Rolling Stone wrote of them in 1970. Even the band's name originated from the Beatles. Badfinger had called itself the Ivies in the years preceding their joining Apple, but, at the suggestion of Apple official/Beatles assistant Neil Aspinall, agreed to change it to Badfinger. (The working title of the Beatles' \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends\u201d was \u201cBad Finger Boogie\u201d).",
      "Their time on top ended after 1972. Amid cutbacks at Apple and allegations of financial mismanagement, Badfinger left for Warner Bros., faded commercially and sustained a tragic loss when Ham took his life in 1975. After initially breaking up, the remaining members periodically reunited but never approached their early success.",
      "Evans took his own life in 1983 and Gibbins died of a brain aneurysm in 2005.",
      "Molland remained active well after Badfinger's prime, touring until his health began to fail last year and releasing such solo albums as \u201cThis Way Up\u201d \u201cAfter the Pearl\u201d and \u201cBe True To Yourself.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",

      "The judge\u2019s ruling came in a lawsuit filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has already been compromised by the president\u2019s orders.",
      "A national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of more than 100 lawsuits opposing a slew of executive orders Trump has issued as he seeks to reverse the policies of former President Joe Biden.",
      "The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Brendan Hurson in Baltimore, a Biden nominee, keeps enforcement of the orders on hold while the case plays out, though the administration is expected to appeal.",
      "Several hospitals across the country halted such care for minors in the days after Trump's order to avoid losing federal funding.",
      "Another judge in Seattle has also blocked the orders in four states in a separate lawsuit filed by a group of Democratic-led states.",

      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "At 27 years and more than 250 days, the selfie- and snuggle-loving llama called Whitetop dethroned Dalai Llama, the Guinness World Records announced last week. Dalai lived on a ranch in Albuquerque and was announced as the oldest in 2023 shortly after his 27th birthday.",
      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",
      "Davis attributes Whitetop's long life to great veterinary care and exercise, as well as it simply loving his job.",
      "The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.",
      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",
      "\u201cWhen I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed,\" said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.",
      "With Whitetop\u2019s newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, \u201cStill Spit\u2019n.\u201d The proceeds go to the camp.",
      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",
      "\u201cTypically llamas only spit when they are scared, uncomfortable or territorial over something,\" she said. \"And he just loves his job so much that he doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d",

      "Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the new measure",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the law.",
      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming is the first state to explicitly outlaw pill abortions, though that and other abortion bans over the past three years are on hold pending a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court.",
      "Ten other states require abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on women seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Under Wyoming's new law, pregnant women planning pill abortions will have to drive potentially long distances to get an ultrasound and have it documented. They would have the opportunity but not be required to view the image of the fetus at least 48 hours before a pill abortion.",
      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",
      "Pregnant woman who do not get an ultrasound will not be penalized under the new law, however. Instead it is medical providers who face up to $9,000 in fines and six months in jail for not arranging it.",
      "But there are few if any active abortion providers left. Last week the state's only full-service abortion clinic stopped providing any abortion care, surgical or medicinal, after Gordon signed a bill requiring such facilities to be licensed as surgical centers.",
      "Wellspring Health Access in Casper is wary of running afoul of the law while it challenges it and others in court, President Julie Burkhart said.",
      "It was not clear whether Wyoming's only other clinic providing medication abortions, a family medicine practice in Jackson, continues to do so. There was no response to phone messages left with the clinic seeking comment Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Pill abortions remain possible in the state through remote services: Women have access through the Just the Pill telehealth service and online providers such as Abuzz, The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, and Aid Access, according to Chelsea\u2019s Fund.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than 3 in 5 abortions carried out in the U.S. through the formal health care system in 2023 were medicinal. Wyoming had the biggest portion of abortions via pill that year: 19 in 20.",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case",
      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",

      "Senate Republicans in Georgia have advanced two bills restricting gender-affirming care for transgender people",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",
      "\u201cI will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent,\u201d Halpern said.",
      "Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who has two transgender children, took the stand toward the end of the evening.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were debating a political football instead of people,\" Harrell said of a debate on the school sports bill. \"And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people \u2014 parents, children, families.\u201d",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors who help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, aged 81.",
      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",
      "He was credited with saving the lives of 2.4 million babies through his plasma donations, the national agency responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, also known as Lifeblood, said in a statement.",
      "Lifeblood chief executive Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had hoped that someone in Australia would one day beat his donation record.",
      "\u201cJames was a remarkable, stoically kind and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,\u201d Cornelissen said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt was James\u2019 belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\u201d Cornelissen added.",
      "Mellowship said his mother, Tracey Mellowship, Harrison\u2019s daughter, needed the treatment when he and his brother, Scott, were born.",
      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",

      "\u201cAfter the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you\u2019re only really alive because people donated blood,\u201d Jarrod Mellowship said. \u201cThe day he turned 18, he started donating.\u201d",
      "The application of anti-D in fighting hemolytic disease of the newborn was not discovered until the 1960s.",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",

Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",

      "President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health is facing questions from a Senate panel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A health economist who famously clashed with officials at the National Institutes of Health faces Senate questioning Wednesday on his nomination to head that agency.",
      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",
      "He \u201chas a vision to restore faith in medical research for the American people,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the Senate health committee considering the nomination, wrote on X after meeting with Bhattacharya last month.",
      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",
      "Bhattacharya gained public attention as one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm and argued that people at low risk of COVID-19 should live normally while building up immunity through infection.",
      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",
      "Bhattacharya holds a medical degree but is not a practicing physician. His own research on the economics of health care has been funded by the NIH.",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

      "There's a mid-March deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, and hesitation is surfacing among congressional Republicans about potential cuts to Medicaid",
      "WASHINGTON -- Every time a baby is born in Louisiana, where Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson handily won reelection last year, there\u2019s more than a 60% chance taxpayers will finance the birth through Medicaid.",
      "In Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2019s central California district, 6 out of 10 people use Medicaid to pay for doctor visits and emergency room trips.",
      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",
      "But Republicans, he said, are not looking at serious ways to drive down the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe only reason for the cuts right now is to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cNone of them are talking about the need to do better health reform.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "Officials say Pakistan has reported two new cases of polio in its southern and eastern provinces, posing a setback to the country\u2019s efforts to eradicate a disease that remains endemic only in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan has reported two new cases of polio in its southern and eastern provinces, health officials said on Friday, posing a setback to the country\u2019s efforts to eradicate a disease that remains endemic only in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan.",
      "The latest cases, confirmed by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program, were detected in Sindh and Punjab provinces. This brings the total number of polio cases in Pakistan to five since January 2025. In 2024, Pakistan recorded 74 polio cases.",
      "The latest development comes as health workers conclude a targeted vaccination drive in high-risk areas later Friday. Earlier this month, authorities launched a weeklong nationwide anti-polio campaign aiming to immunize 44.2 million children under the age of five.",
      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks."

Some of our fundamental assumptions are being undermined to their very core,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned in a letter to the EU\u2019s 27 leaders, who will consider ways to access more money for defense spending and ease restrictions on it.",
      "But perhaps the biggest challenge for the EU on Thursday will be to take a united stance at a moment when it's fractured, since much of what the bloc does requires unanimous support.",

      "It is not aimed at urgently drumming up more arms and ammunition to fill any supply vacuum created by the U.S. freeze. Nor will it unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, meanwhile, are still battling to slow Russia\u2019s advances along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region. Tens of thousands of soldiers and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed.",

      "The Trump administration is demanding that the Europeans spend as much as 5%, well beyond the NATO benchmark of at least 2%. Seven European allies still fall short of even that target. The U.S. spends around 3.4%, according to NATO figures, and a Pentagon audit that could reduce that is pending.",
      "Von der Leyen has proposed that the EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, raise up to 150 billion euros ($161 billion) on financial markets that would be loaned to member countries buy new military equipment for themselves, or to send to Ukraine.",
      "The commission would also aim to free up funds from other sectors of the bloc\u2019s massive long-term budget and to relax its stringent debt rules so that each country could invest up to 1.5% more of their GDP on defense, should they want to.",
      "The leaders will also discuss whether to place more arms contracts with Ukraine\u2019s defense industry, and to help integrate it into the European industrial network. Production costs in Ukraine are much lower, providing a relatively fast way to supply more arms and ammunition.",
      "It's an approach that Zelenskyy has praised.",

      "Possible EU support for a future force to police any peace agreement in Ukraine will also be weighed. Britain and France are leading that effort, which could involve several other European countries.",
      "The summit comes as the EU is arguably at its weakest point, fragmented by the steady rise of a hard right that is often pro-Russian.",
      "Hungary and Slovakia have routinely undermined support for Ukraine. Hungary is threatening to veto a joint statement drafted for Thursday\u2019s summit but would not be able to block any major security or financing decisions.",
      "Meanwhile, many larger countries face uncertainties at home. Germany will soon have a new chancellor, but France\u2019s latest government is fragile, and Spain relies on small parties to keep its coalition intact.",
      "Poland offers strong leadership under Prime Minister Donald Tusk, however a presidential election looms and a right-wing candidate is well placed. The Dutch cabinet dominated by hard-right leader Geert Wilders is shaky."

      "TUNIS, Tunisia -- A Tunisian court opened a high-profile trial Tuesday in which 40 people, including leading opposition figures, stand accused of conspiring against state security. Activists protested outside, calling it a baseless case and part of a politically driven crackdown.",
      "Nine of the defendants were not allowed to appear at the trial, deemed by the court as too dangerous to release from custody. Their lawyers demanded the right of their clients to appear before a judge, as did the protesters outside.",
      "In addition to opposition politicians, the accused include former diplomats, business leaders, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders, and some have spent more than two years in pre-trial detention. Others have fled abroad.",

      "Saied\u2019s supporters argue his crackdowns are necessary to stabilize a nation grappling with inflation, unemployment, and corruption. Many Tunisians blame political elites for economic mismanagement.",

      "The Supreme Court, upholding earlier lower court decisions that had acquitted the three top officials of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, said that a tsunami of the size that hit the plant was unforeseeable and the executives could not be held accountable for negligence.",
      "The ruling rejected an appeal by the prosecution seeking their criminal responsibility, and the acquittal of two executives - Sakae Muto and Ichiro Takekuro - is now final. The charges against a third executive, former TEPCO chairperson Tsunehisa Katsumata, was dropped following his death in October.",
      "The case was the only criminal trial related to the nuclear accident, in which a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and massive tsunami hit the plant, destroying its cooling systems and causing three reactors to melt. A large amount of radiation was released into surrounding soil and the sea, causing tens of thousands of residents to lose their homes, jobs and community ties.",
      "The defendants were charged by a civil prosecution panel after the public prosecutors had dropped the case.

      "LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Wednesday praised the hundreds of British troops who died fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq \u201calongside our allies,\u201d in an oblique rebuke of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who has questioned the merits of a potential European peacekeeping force in Ukraine following the signing of any peace agreement between the country and Russia.",
      "In his opening remarks before the start of a weekly parliamentary question session, Starmer specifically paid tribute to six British soldiers who died on patrol in Afghanistan when their vehicle was struck by an explosive. Thursday marks the 13-year anniversary of their deaths.",
      "\u201cThese men fought and died for their country, our country,\" Starmer told the House of Commons. \u201cAnd across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 642 individuals died fighting for Britain alongside our allies, many more were wounded.\u201d",
      "Without directly referencing Vance, the prime minister said he and all lawmakers will \u201cnever forget their bravery and their sacrifice.\u201d",
      "Vance said in an interview with Fox News this week that an economic pact with Kyiv sought by President Donald Trump \u201cis a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",

      "No other countries have yet indicated they will be sending troops to any peacekeeping mission.",
      "Trump has offered no U.S. security guarantee and has, like Vance, indicated that an economic deal with Ukraine, that sees American money and people in the country but no forces, would be enough to fend off any future attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "In his overnight address to Congress, Trump appeared to soften his tone with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following last Friday's fractious meeting in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy had been expected to sign off on a minerals deal, intended in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war. But that plan was scrapped as the visit was ended abruptly after their meeting.",

      "Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal\u2019s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.",
      "\u201cCooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,\u201d Mulino wrote. \u201cIt doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.\"",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.",
      "The deal has to be approved by Panama\u2019s government.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",
      "Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was \u201cthe result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\u201d Sixt said."

      "Mali has suspended licenses for artisanal gold mining due to several fatal accidents at mining sites",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Mali said on Wednesday it was suspending licenses for foreign artisanal gold mining companies after a series of fatal accidents in the West African country, one of Africa\u2019s top three gold producers.",
      "Gen. Assimi Goita, president of Mali's transitional government, ordered \u201cthe suspension of artisanal mining permits granted to foreigners,\u201d according to a statement issued following a Council of Ministers meeting which was read out on the national television station ORTM.",
      "The move comes in response to accidents at mining sites that have claimed the lives of dozens of people, most recently in January in the Koulikoro region, in the south of the country, and in February in the Kayes region, in the southwest. Artisanal gold mining is estimated to produce around 30 tons of gold a year and represents 6% of Mali\u2019s annual gold production.",
      "The Council of Ministers' statement said measures would be taken to facilitate the recovery of equipment used in gold panning and its addition to the national patrimony. This is a major change, as previously mining companies could recover their equipment after paying a fine to the country\u2019s authorities.",
      "\u201cThese measures are designed to further strengthen the state authorities and protect our fellow citizens. These measures give us the power to seize materials (mining equipment), which will be confiscated and placed in the domain of national heritage,\u201d Gen. Daoud Ali Mohammedine, the minister of security and civil protection, said on ORTM.",
      "In recent years, there have been concerns that profits from unregulated mining in northern Mali could benefit extremists active in that part of the country.",
      "\u201cGold is by far Mali\u2019s most important export, comprising more than 80% of total exports in 2021,\u201d according to the International Trade Administration, which is an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. More than 2 million people, or more than 10% of Mali\u2019s population, depend on the mining sector for income, according to the U.S.",
      "Mali is one of the top three gold producing countries in Africa. Several major gold producing companies operate in this West African country, including Barrick Gold, B2Gold, Resolute Mining and Allied Gold.",
      "Tensions have been rising between some mining companies and the military authorities, who are demanding that companies pay money and comply with a new mining code. At least four employees of the Canadian company Barrick were still in prison in Bamako at the end of last year. Military authorities then seized 3 tons of gold from Barrick\u2019s mining site and deposited it in a Bamako bank."

      "With the addition of the ministries overseeing investments, regional development and information, and tourism and sports, Smer now controls nine ministries, Hlas six and the Slovak National Party two.",
      "The deal was a result of a recent crisis in the coalition that risked its parliamentary majority.",
      "The coalition had 79 seats in the 150-seat parliament known as the National Council before four Hlas lawmakers and three others, including Huliak, in the Slovak National Party parted with their parliamentary factions. The lawmakers did not join the opposition but have demanded posts in the government, parliament and state institutions in exchange for their loyalty.",
      "That has made it difficult for the government to advance its agenda.",

      "She also cited Huliak\u2019s advocacy of violence against environmentalists as a reason not to swear him in. Huliak, the mayor of O\u010dov\u00e1 town in central Slovakia, has also attacked LGBTQ+ people and the European Union and expressed pro-Russian views.",

      "\u201cI think between availability and the time that people have to queue to get sandbags, they\u2019re just making the easier choice and grabbing potting mix,\u201d Effeney said, adding one customer bought 30 bags from his store at Samford on Brisbane\u2019s northwest fringe.",
      "Several Brisbane sandbag collection points were either empty or people had to line up for hours to collect available sandbags. A beach volleyball business complained that some of its sand had been stolen to fill bags.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Facing the possibility of a fundamental disengagement under U.S. President Donald Trump, European Union leaders opened a day of emergency summit talks Thursday to beef up their own military defenses and make sure that Ukraine will still be properly protected by its allies.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, was conferring with summit host Antonio Costa over breakfast on how to meet the challenge on a short deadline only days after he and his prospective coalition partner pushed plans to loosen the nation\u2019s rules on running up debt to allow for higher defense spending.",
      "At the same time, the 27-nation bloc was waking up to the news from French President Emmanuel Macron would confer with EU leaders the possibility of using France\u2019s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats.",

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to be up to the task and has proposed an 800 billion euro ($840 billion) plan that would allow EU member states to spend much more on defense despite their current budgetary woes and profit from loans to kickstart the process.",
      "Part of any plan is also to protect the increasingly beleaguered position of Ukraine, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to take part in the talks.",
      "Early this week, Trump ordered a pause to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine as he sought to press Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia, bringing fresh urgency to the EU summit in Brussels.",
      "\u201cEurope faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us have seen in our adult lifetime. Some of our fundamental assumptions are being undermined to their very core,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned in a letter to the EU\u2019s 27 leaders, who will consider ways to access more money for defense spending and ease restrictions on it.",
      "But perhaps the biggest challenge for the EU on Thursday will be to take a united stance at a moment when it\u2019s fractured, since much of what the bloc does requires unanimous support.",
      "Even if the challenges are so daunting, Thursday's summit is unlikely to produce immediate decisions on spending for Ukraine or its own defenses. Another EU summit where the real contours of decisions would be much clearer is set for March 20-21.",

They have shades to them, and that is very human,\u201d says Kumar, who chanced upon a Pakistani drama through a chunky videocassette when she was a teenager living in the northern Indian city of Aligarh. It was love at first watch.",
      "\u201cThey captivated me. We got a cable connection that offered PTV. Then YouTube came and I realized I could search for whatever drama I wanted. I haven\u2019t taken a stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get exposure to Pakistani life in the scenes, but the struggles the characters have with their relatives are ones I would have with my own.\u201d",
      "Pakistani TV veteran Khaled Anam is delighted by Indians\u2019 enthusiasm for the country\u2019s serials and the barriers they help erode.",
      "\u201cWhat Bollywood is to India, dramas are to Pakistan,\u201d says Anam, who is based in Karachi and has worked as an actor since the 1980s. He has appeared in many dramas, including the ratings smash \u201cHumsafar\u201d (\u201cLife Partner\u201d).",
      "India dominates the movie market in South Asia and beyond, with big stars and bigger budgets. Pakistanis have been exposed to Bollywood films for decades, although the prevailing hostile political climate means they can't watch them in movie theaters. The bans are mutual, though. India, like Pakistan, restricts content from across the border in movie theaters and TV channels.",
      "And while India is no slouch when it comes to TV production, it doesn\u2019t offer viewers what Pakistan does, according to Anam: simplicity, depth of writing and a limited number of episodes.",
      "\u201cThere are 15-minute flashbacks in Indian serials. (The characters) are decked out and dolled up. It\u2019s a fantasy world. The shows go on forever. Everything is \u2018DUN dun dun!\u2019\u201d says Anam, mimicking a dramatic musical riff and shaking his hands.",
      "The actors on the couch in Islamabad are rehearsing lines about a woman who is disrespectful and so, according to one of them, is an unsuitable marriage prospect. The delivery and grammar could be heard in virtually any South Asian household.",
      "\u201cPakistanis are generally emotional people, and that is in their dramas also,\u201d says Islamabad-based director Saife Hassan. \u201cIt would take me less than two minutes to explain the plot of the super-duper hit \u2018Kabhi Main, Kabhi Tum\u2019 (\u2018Sometimes Me, Sometimes You\u2019). It\u2019s about the emotions between a husband and wife.\u201d",
      "Hassan, who began his TV career in the 1990s, says Indians frequently comment on his social media pages and send him direct messages about his work. He even recalls Indian viewers praying for the recovery of a character who was in a coma.",
      "Hassan would love to see more homegrown dramas make it onto platforms like Netflix, as some Indian shows have with great success. But he wonders whether international audiences would understand and connect with Pakistani stories or lives: \u201cThe way we think is different from the West. Our shows are not driven by events. They are driven by emotions.\u201d",
      "There is also a lack of raunch in Pakistani dramas, which are family-friendly with little to no vulgarity, violence, or even action. Indians, therefore, are a natural audience for Pakistani dramas, Hassan says.",
      "\u201cThey are our people. They are like us. They eat like us,\u201d he says. \u201cI love India, and I love Indians. They have grown out of this animosity.\u201d",

      "Groups from the United States, Ukraine and all over Italy made their way through a town of grey and brown stone houses that look little changed from when the saint was born here more than 840 years ago.",
      "They said they were inspired by St. Francis\u2019 love for the poor, peace and creation \u2014 all priorities for the pope, too, and the Franciscans, one of the largest orders in the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cThe life of St. Francis teaches the way to holiness is giving up yourself, getting rid of things that hold us back in our life here, and just offer ourselves to the Lord,\u201d said the Rev. Paul Vu, who was visiting in early March with a group of 50 Vietnamese-American parishioners from Santa Ana, California.",
      "In 1182, Francis was born to a wealthy family in Assisi, which rises above a fertile valley in central Italy. Praying in front of a crucifix, he heard a call to reform the church. He aspired to strip everything down to the essentials in the service of God.",
      "The Santuario della Spogliazione, which literally means stripping, is a sober stone church on the hillside. It marks the spot where he gave up even his clothes in front of his father, who disinherited him.

      "For Assisi\u2019s current bishop, the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino, St. Francis\u2019 renunciation of material encumbrances also signaled his love of creation and of peace.",
      "\u201cFrancis, stripping himself, came back to nature in some sense. So we must receive nature as a gift of God, and respect this gift,\u201d Sorrentino told The Associated Press.",

Enzo Fortunato, who spent 30 years in Assisi and now leads the Vatican\u2019s committee on World Children\u2019s Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a name that contains a life program.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, amid fears that the trade war could harm U.S. manufacturers",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, amid fears that the trade war could harm U.S. manufacturers.",
      "The announcement comes after Trump spoke with leaders of the \u201cbig 3\u201d automakers, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis on Wednesday. Trump also said he told the automaker chief executives that they should move production to the U.S from Canada and Mexico, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\u201cWe spoke with the big three auto dealers,\u201d Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \u201cWe are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\u201d referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.\"",
      "Trump's press secretary said the president is open to hearing about additional exemptions but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not willing to lift Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press. The official confirmed the stance on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "\"\u201cBoth countries will continue to be in contact today,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s office said.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford earlier told The Associated Press the auto sector in the U.S. and Canada would last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down the assembly lines in the U.S. and in Ontario.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to lose their jobs,\u201d he said.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick earlier said there might be carveouts coming to the 25% tariffs placed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "But, Trump's tariffs have stirred up bad blood among allies who see his aggression on trade as misguided, with Canada suggesting it will reject any offer to water down the day-old tariffs. The trade war is not necessarily a brief skirmish as the White House maintains that even harsher taxes on imports are coming in April, even as businesses and consumers worry that rising costs will crush economic growth, worsen inflation and result in layoffs.",
      "Still, the administration is grappling with the fallout of tariff that could create serious blowback for his political mandate to lower prices. Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs could cause some financial pain, yet he has repeatedly said the tariffs will lead to more domestic investment and factory work.",
      "In a Wednesday interview with Bloomberg Television, Lutnick said that Trump would update his tariff plans with an afternoon announcement, possibly sparing sectors such as autos from the import taxes.",
      "On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes and subsidies provided by other countries. That could dramatically increase the tariff rates charged globally while maintaining the risk of a broader tariff.",
      "Lutnick said he would talk on Wednesday morning with Trump about the possible options regarding Canada and Mexico, saying that both countries are working to address the U.S. president's concerns about drug trafficking. Lutnick said to expect Trump to announce his decision Wednesday afternoon.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump put 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, taxing Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate. The president also doubled the 10% tariff he placed on China to 20%. The administration has said the tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of drugs such as fentanyl, but Trump also suggested that the tariffs are about getting rid of persistent U.S. trade deficits.",
      "The taxes almost immediately triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday. The U.S. stock market has given up all of the gains since Trump's victory in last year's presidential election and consumers are already exhausted by inflation and worried the costs of the tax hike would lead to higher prices. Those concerns may have prompted Lutnick to signal a possible retreat in a Tuesday afternoon interview with the Fox Business Network.",
      "The U.S. president tried to play down the possible economic harm as \u201ca little disturbance,\u201d as the administration has suggested that the estimates of higher inflation and slower growth in most outside economic forecasts are overblown.",
      "\u201cIt may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\u201d he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \u201cYou have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\u201d",
      "Trump also said in his speech that he spoke on Tuesday with \u201call three, the top people\u201d at the major U.S. automakers and \u201cthey're so excited.\u201d The big three automakers are General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep. The domestic auto sector would be especially vulnerable to tariffs as it depends on Mexico and Canada as part of its supply chains.",
      "Trudeau said on Tuesday that his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days, stressing that the United States had abandoned a long-standing friendship.",
      "\u201cToday, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\u201d Trudeau said on Tuesday.",
      "Mexico indicated it would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.",
      "Beijing responded with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",
      "\u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end,\u201d China\u2019s embassy to the United States posted on X on Tuesday night.",
      "In response to China, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that the United States is \u201cprepared\u201d for war against the world's second largest economy.",
      "\u201cThose who long for peace must prepare for war,\u201d Hegseth said Wednesday morning. \"If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong.\"",
      "Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

      "Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going.",
      "But the same factors that have pulled mortgage rates to their lowest level since December \u2014 signs that the U.S. economy is slowing and uncertainty over the potential fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports \u2014 are clouding the outlook for where mortgage rates will go from here.",
      "\u201cWe do not anticipate significant relief from high mortgage rates in the near future because of inflation remaining stubbornly high, which will not be helped by the tariffs that the Trump administration appears committed to rolling out,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. has declined six weeks in a row from 7.04% in mid-January to 6.76% last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year earlier, it averaged 6.94%.",
      "The average rate is now at its lowest level since Dec. 19, when it was 6.72%. It briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but remains more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates echoes moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 4.79% in mid-January, has been mostly easing since then, reflecting worries about the economy\u2019s growth and the potential impact from the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on several of the country's biggest trading partners.",
      "While one could say the bond market jitters have ultimately benefited home shoppers by leading to lower mortgage rates, the trajectory for rates from here is far from certain.",
      "Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That\u2019s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated.",
      "And then there\u2019s the Fed, which has signaled a more cautious approach as it gauges where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue.",
      "So far, the steady decline in mortgage rates this year hasn\u2019t been enough to drive home sales higher. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in January as rising mortgage rates and prices froze out many would-be homebuyers despite a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "Pending home sales, a bellwether for future completed sales, point to potentially further sales declines in coming months. They slid to an all-time low in January.",
      "Still, last week, mortgage applications jumped 20.4% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And a measure of home loan refinancing applications surged 37%, the MBA said.",
      "While a pickup in mortgage applications is typical for this time of year, the sharp increase is a signal that mortgage rates have fallen enough to spur some buyers off the fence.",
      "The pullback in rates comes at a good time for home shoppers. The inventory of homes on the market has risen sharply from a year ago and prices are rising more slowly nationally and declining in many metropolitan areas, such as Austin, Dallas and Tampa, Florida.",
      "Still, more attractive mortgage rates may not be enough to motivate home shoppers if the economy and labor market worsen.",
      "\u201cInflation is still a problem, but now the economy is starting to show signs of weakness,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cWhat that means to the housing market is that those two factors make buyers more reluctant to jump into the market.\u201d"

      "BEIJING -- The Chinese government unveiled an annual economic growth target of \u201caround 5%\u201d on Wednesday, despite the possible negative impact of a looming trade war with the United States, and pledged to address what it called \u201csluggish\u201d consumer spending at home.",
      "The target was announced at the opening session of the annual meeting of China's legislature. It's the same as for the last two years but will likely be more difficult to achieve because of the new, higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese products and other economic headwinds. The use of \u201caround\u201d gives the government some room if growth falls short.",
      "The target signals the government's intention to try to stabilize growth in challenging economic times but hold back on more dramatic action that some economists say is needed to supercharge it.",
      "The government also said in a draft budget released Wednesday that defense spending would rise 7.2% this year to 1.78 trillion yuan ($245 billion), second only to the United States.",
      "It released the growth target in a separate report, parts of which were presented to the nearly 3,000 members of the National People's Congress by Premier Li Qiang. It acknowledged both international and domestic challenges.",
      "\u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science, and technology,\u201d the report said, without specifics. \u201cUnilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.\u201d",
      "It added: \u201cDomestically, the foundation for China\u2019s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough. Effective demand is weak, and consumption, in particular, is sluggish.\u201d",
      "The International Monetary Fund has projected that China's economy will grow 4.6% this year, down from 5% in 2024, according to Chinese government statistics.",
      "The new report placed more emphasis on reviving domestic demand and consumption than last year's, echoing a shift by the ruling Communist Party at meetings in December. It said the government should \u201cmake domestic demand the main engine and anchor of economic growth.\u201d",
      "The report added that \u201cachieving this year's targets will not be easy, and we must make arduous efforts to meet them.\u201d",
      "Across-the-board 20% tariffs imposed this week on Chinese products by U.S. President Donald Trump pose the latest threat to an economy already weighed down by a prolonged real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending and private business investment. The tariffs could crimp sales to one of China\u2019s major export markets, making the need to boost domestic demand more urgent.",
      "The new report offered some details on the party's plans for a \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy,\u201d including a rise in the government budget deficit from 3% to 4% of GDP, or the size of the overall economy. It also reiterated the party\u2019s announcement in December that the central bank would shift its monetary policy from \u201cprudent\u201d to \u201cmoderately loose\u201d for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "The government will issue 1.3 trillion yuan ($180 billion) in ultra-long term bonds, up from 1 trillion yuan last year, the report said. Of that, 300 billion yuan would go toward a program launched last year that offers rebates to consumers who trade in automobiles or appliances for new ones, doubling central government support for the program.",
      "Economists expressed doubts over whether the policies will do enough, noting that the government reduced its inflation target to 2% from 3% last year, and suggesting leaders have accepted that the economy is still mired in deflation, or a cycle of weakening prices.",
      "The degree of support is \u201cmore modest than it may appear,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe remain skeptical that it will be sufficient to prevent growth from slowing this year, especially given the headwinds on the external front and the lack of a more pronounced shift in government spending toward support for consumption.\u201d",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping also wants to wean the economy off its long-running dependence on the highly indebted real estate market.",
      "He is directing economic resources into developing a more innovative, high-tech economy \u2014 and with growing restrictions on U.S. technology exports to China, one that isn't beholden to other countries for the most powerful semiconductors and other electronic components.",
      "Xi told delegates from Jiangsu province, one of China's wealthier coastal provinces known for exports, on Wednesday that \u201ctechnological innovation and industrial innovation are the basic paths to developing new quality productivity.\u201d",

      "The two political parties expected to form the next German government have agreed to significantly loosen the country\u2019s constitutional restriction on deficits, enabling 1 trillion euros ($1.08 trillion) or more in new borrowing and spending on defense ...",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The two political parties expected to form the next German government have agreed to loosen the country's constitution restrictions on borrowing, enabling 1 trillion euros ($1.08 trillion) or more in spending on defense and infrastructure.",
      "It\u2019s a major change in Germany\u2019s debt-averse political culture, rejecting conventional economic wisdom that long dominated Europe\u2019s biggest economy and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries.",
      "Here are key facts about the debt brake and what the changes will mean for Germany and Europe.",
      "The debt brake was passed in 2009, when a global financial crisis led to sharp increase in government borrowing in Germany and around the world. The debt brake also reflected cultural and political skepticism about debt in general that for years left a deep imprint on German politics.",
      "The debt brake limited new borrowing to 0.35% of gross domestic product - a tight limit when compared to European Union budget rules requiring less than 3%, and the 2024 U.S. federal deficit of 6.4%.",
      "The debt brake appeared to work fine for years - until it didn't. German governments lived within the limits during the good times in the 2010s, often running small surpluses.",
      "But the pandemic, slowing growth and Russia's invasion of Ukraine put the debt brake under severe strain.",
      "The government had to invoke an emergency clause to borrow and spend more on pandemic relief for businesses in 2020. Then it declared another emergency in 2021, and another one in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised pressure for more defense spending and relief for utility customers. Yet another emergency exemption was used in 2023. However in late 2023 the Federal Constitutional Court ruled the government had gone too far in fudging the debt limit, forcing a frantic rewrite of the 2024 budget.",
      "Then Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government collapsed in November 2024 over disagreement with a coalition party, the pro-business Free Democrats, over spending and the debt brake.",
      "The reformed debt brake would remove the constitutional ceiling when it comes to defense spending. That would support efforts to build up Germany\u2019s own defenses and its ability to further support Ukraine. Germany is already a leading backer of Ukraine, sending 60 Leopard tanks and 175 Marder infantry fighting vehicles as well as 27 air defense systems, including three of its U.S.-made Patriot missile batteries.",
      "\u201cThe extra room for defence spending sends a clear signal to Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as well as to Germany\u2019s European friends that Germany is serious about defending itself and helping Ukraine,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.",
      "\u201cGermany is finally taking on the leadership role which, given its size and its fiscal space, it should have assumed years ago.\u201d",
      "Leaders of the conservative Union bloc agreed with the center-left Social Democrats to exempt military spending over 1% of GDP from the debt limit, as well as a 500 billion euro infrastructure fund for civil and disaster protection, transport infrastructure, hospitals, energy infrastructure, education, scientific research and digitization. Economists estimate that the measure, if passed, could enable a trillion euros in new borrowing and spending over a decade.",
      "The agreement came during talks aimed at forming a coalition government between the two parties.",
      "It was a sharp turnaround for Friedrich Merz, who as Union leader is the likely next chancellor after his party came in first in national elections on Feb. 23. His party program rejected changes to the debt brake, though he had indicated he might be open to negotiation on that point.",
      "The move \u201cfollows the old political principle: if the facts change, I change my mind,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank.",
      "The agreement reflects both long-term strains on the debt brake, and the sudden recent shift in U.S. security policy under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has demanded that Europe do more for own security, disrupting the post-World War II transatlantic alliance under which Europe looked to the U.S. as an ultimate security guarantor.",
      "Trump's public disparagement of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and decision to suspend military aid to Ukraine have shocked European governments into facing the need for vastly more defense spending to fill the gap left by a U.S. seen as no longer committed to Europe's security.",
      "Germany only met the NATO requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense through a 100 billion-euro special fund exempted from the debt brake in 2022 - but that fund will run out in 2027.",
      "The parties plan to rush the changes through the lame duck parliament next week. That's because mainstream parties have the needed two-thirds majority in the old parliament - but will lose that in the new parliament due to electoral gains by the far-right Alternative for Germany and the far-left The Left party who oppose the changes.",
      "The measure would still need votes in the outgoing parliament from the environmentalist Greens, who weren't part of the coalition talks.",
      "Economists say the looser debt brake could help Germany emerge from five years of economic stagnation by increasing spending on things that promote economic activity over the long term. Skimping on infrastructure spending has been blamed for trains that don't run on time due to endless track repairs, crumbling bridges, declining educational achievement levels, and lagging adoption of renewable energy infrastructure and digital technology.",
      "The morning after the announcement, economists started tearing up old growth forecasts and raising their outlook. Morgan Stanley saw the possibility of 0.2% more GDP growth this year and 0.7% more next year. That would be welcome in an economy that shrank for the past two years.",
      "\u201cEverything you thought you knew about Germany\u2019s economic prospects three months ago, or even three weeks ago, should be ripped up,\u201d said Jim Reid, research strategist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThis is game-changing if it goes through.\u201d",
      "The step is a \u201csea change\u201d in German policy, said economist Schmieding.",
      "\u201cThe infrastructure fund signals that the new government will seriously tackle key domestic deficiencies,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cI look forward to the day in the \u2013 probably still somewhat distant \u2013 future when German trains may run as fast and punctual as those in France, Switzerland or Austria.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- Macy's swung to a profit in the fourth quarter, though sales dipped with shoppers remaining cautious about spending.",
      "The strength of the quarterly profit surprised Wall Street, but sales were just below expectations and uncertainty about both the American consumer and new tariffs seeped into the company's outlook for 2025.",
      "Shares dipped 1% in morning trading Thursday.",
      "Macy's joins other retailers including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Abercrombie & Fitch that have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025.",
      "The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America\u2019s three biggest trading partners resulted in immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, while roiling financial markets. Tariffs risk reigniting inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher.",
      "The U.S. slapped 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. It also doubled the tariff Trump announced last month on Chinese products, to 20%.",
      "Possibly raising anxiety further, certain aspects of U.S. trade policy appears to be fluid, making it more difficult for businesses and households to plan ahead. On Wednesday, Trump reversed course and granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers.",
      "Macy's executives emphasized that the company is facing lots of uncertainty given the ever-changing tariff policies. But the company is focusing on what it can control and zeroing in on improving its merchandise and services. Company executives told analysts on the earnings call Thursday that Macy's has been working with its suppliers to increase variety and reduce redundant styles, while adding more exclusive offerings. It's also focusing on improving its store label brands.",
      "\u201cWe are in that retail therapy business, a place of escapism, an opportunity to get away from all of the political noise that happens every day,\u201d Macy's CEO Tony Spring said. \"And we have to lean into that. And so, I don\u2019t think the consumer is going to feel a sense of relief in the short term. I\u2019m not an economist, I can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019ll go on. I challenge our teams every day to think about what do we control?\"",
      "The uncertainty comes as retailers like Macy's were already dealing with cautious consumer spending though sales at the department store have been improving.",
      "Macy's, which also runs Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reported net income of $342 million, or $1.21 per share, for the three-month period ended Feb. 1. Adjusted per-share earnings per were $1.80, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.54 per share, according to FactSet, and reversing a $128 million loss last year.",
      "Sales fell 4.3% to $7.77 billion from $8.12 billion in the year-ago period.",
      "Comparable sales at the overall company\u2014 established business from physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 0.2%. At Macy's nameplate stores, comparable store sales dipped 1.9%.",
      "Macy's has been on a campaign to modernize stores, and that appears to be working. At the first 50 stores that have been upgraded, comparable sales rose 1.2%. Those initiatives \u2014 which include offering more service in shoe departments and more visual displays\u2014 have been added to another 75 stores.",
      "Macy's other brands continue to excel, with comparable sales growth at Bloomingdale\u2019s hitting 6.5%, while Bluemercury reported its 16th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth, the latest at of 6.2%.",
      "Macy's expects to earn $2.05 to $2.25 per share on net revenue of $21 billion to $21.4 billion in the current year. Analysts expect a profit of $2.29 per share on sales of $21.34 billion.",

Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,\u201d he said. The post ended with a clenched fist emoji and a Greenlandic flag.",
      "On the streets of Nuuk, Greenland\u2019s capital, where the temperature was 4 degrees blow zero (minus 20 Celsius) at midday Wednesday and the bright sunshine reflected blindingly off a layer of fresh-fallen snow, people are taking Trump\u2019s designs on their country seriously.",
      "Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in Greenland, a huge mineral-rich island that sits along strategic sea lanes in the North Atlantic. Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark with a population of about 56,000 people, lies off the northeastern coast of Canada, closer to Washington, D.C., than to Copenhagen.",

Since taking office, Trump has suggested moving Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and turning it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East;\u201d announced his intention to regain control of the Panama Canal; and stopped arms deliveries to Ukraine after the country\u2019s president was slow to endorse Washington\u2019s roadmap for a peace deal with Russia.",

      "Google's amped-up usage of more sophisticated AI overviews is likely to amplify worries that the summaries will make web surfers even less likely to click on links to take them to sites with useful information on the topic.",

      "The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America\u2019s three biggest trading partners drew immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, sending financial markets into a tailspin. Tariffs threaten to rekindle inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher and has created more uncertainty for families and businesses.",
      "Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.",

      "Shares slid more than 14% Wednesday and they're down almost 46% this year.",
      "The retail landscape is becoming more challenging, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, wrote Wednesday. Yet he also noted that Abercrombie had a very good 2024, making it more difficult to match in 2025.",
      "\u201cIt is reasonable to expect some moderation in the growth rate \u2013 as is reflected in the company outlook,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "Abercrombie & Fitch, however, joins a growing list of retailers that see a slowdown ahead, and not all of those companies had a banner year in 2024.",
      "Sales and profits slipped for Target last year and the retailer said this week that there will be \u201d meaningful pressure \u201d on its profits to start 2025 because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, in addition to other costs. Even before the trade war heated up this week, Target reported falling profits and sales in the crucial period leading up to the year-end holidays, with more customers pausing before breaking out the wallet.",
      "Target CEO Brian Cornell said Tuesday that Americans could see prices for food begin to rise in just a few days, particularly produce from Mexico such as avocados. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday the country will respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the United States with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, with details to come.",
      "While Cornell declined to talk specifically about potential price hikes shoppers might see on Target shelves, he warned that there will be price increases for some products.",
      "Target shares are down almost 15% this year and specialty retailers that have seen stock gains are in the minority. Shares of Gap are down 15% this year and shares of American Eagle, Guess and Zumiez are all down about 29%.",
      "Walmart, like Abercrombie & Fitch, thrived in 2024 but sees a potentially rougher path forward.",
      "Late last month, the nation's largest retailer said its per-share earnings for this year could be as much as 27 cents below Wall Street expectations. The company expects annual sales to rise 3% or 4% to between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That also caught Wall Street off guard, where 2025 sales projections had been closer to $708 billion."

      "President Christine Lagarde said at her post-meeting news conference that with the cut, rates were \u201cmeaningfully less restrictive\u201d on economic activity, but added that the bank was \u201cnot pre-committing to a particular rate path\" in months ahead.",
      "She acknowledged conflicting pressures ahead from trade and the prospect of more government spending. While \u201can increase in defense and infrastructure spending could also add to growth... increasing friction in global trade is adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation.\u201d",
      "At its last meeting, the bank said rates were still in \u201crestrictive\u201d territory, indicating further cuts were ahead. After Thursday, the bank's next step is less clear, said Carsten Brzeski, chief of global macro at ING bank.",
      "\u201cWith the increased uncertainty and the prospects of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB\u2019s direction of travel after today\u2019s rate cut is no longer as clear as it was a few weeks ago,\u201d Brzeski said. \u201cA pause at the next meeting to come to terms with the new macro reality now looks like a possibility.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile new concerns that would massively reshuffle the economic picture are likely to intrude: the potential impact of new tariffs on European imports from U.S. President Trump, which could slow growth, and plans for massive new defense spending and borrowing, which could mean more growth but also more inflation.",
      "Those two forces could push the ECB in opposite directions: a hit to growth would call for lower rates in months ahead, while more persistent inflation would argue for keeping rates higher in coming months.",
      "Growth estimates for Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, shot up overnight and long-term interest rates rose in response to an agreement by the two parties that will form the country\u2019s next government to loosen constitutional limits on borrowing and exempt defense spending.",
      "That is a major turnaround in German budget policy and opens the way for a trillion or more in new borrowing and spending over the next decade.",
      "Also in the mix are concerns that Trump will impose new tariffs on European goods, hurting growth in an export-dependent economy.",
      "The 20 countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB determines interest rate policy stagnated in the last three months of the year, showing zero growth. Consumers burned by an earlier outbreak of inflation remain cautious, while businesses have been unsettled by concerns about what Trump may do.",
      "Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, predicted the ECB would stay flexible and decide based on incoming data: \u201cThe possible push, in terms of GDP growth, from higher government spending may be offset by the pull coming from US tariffs and the net effect is unclear.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Electric vehicle shoppers could be thrown a couple of curve balls in 2025 if the Trump administration goes through with some of its plans",
      "Car shoppers considering buying an electric vehicle in 2025 will have more factors to consider than buyers in previous years. Most of it is good news. For instance, automakers are continuing to introduce new EVs and improve their current models. Expanded charging options and very attractive used EV prices are also hot topics for this year. But there are also negative trends you need to watch out for. Edmunds\u2019 auto experts break down what you can expect before heading out and buying an EV for 2025.",
      "According to the NPR article \u201d Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s tariffs could impact you and your wallet,\u201d the price for certain imported electric vehicles will increase with the Trump administration tariffs. Tariffs on other components or materials used for vehicle manufacturing will also have an impact. Estimates vary widely on how much extra you might have to pay should these tariffs be in effect for a long duration, but it could potentially be thousands of dollars depending on the vehicle.",
      "The new administration has also said it would repeal the federal EV tax credit of $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs. Right now, certain new EVs qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, which can be put toward the sales price with a purchase or lease or toward your tax liability if you purchase it. Used EVs priced under $25,000 can qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000.",
      "Tesla charging stations, which used to be available to Tesla vehicles only, are now open to most non-Tesla EVs. This expansion includes Tesla\u2019s vast network of fast-charging stations called Supercharger stations, and it\u2019s a big deal because it significantly increases the number of charging stations EV owners can use. Public charging stations from various third-party companies like EVgo and Electrify America were the only options for non-Tesla EVs in the past. Tesla\u2019s network of charging stations is nationwide and the largest in the country. The stations are also very reliable and are rarely offline.",
      "Tesla stations can be easy to use once everything is set up. But you need to check with your vehicle\u2019s manufacturer to find out how to use a Tesla charging station and likely buy or obtain a charging connector adaptor.",
      "EV shoppers have plenty of choices in 2025, and most of these models offer plenty of range. Many vehicles, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5, provide over 300 miles of range on certain models. Some high-dollar EVs from Mercedes-Benz and Lucid and electric trucks from GM easily exceeded the 400-mile mark when Edmunds tested them.",
      "EVs are also becoming more affordable; a few have starting prices below $35,000 even without the federal tax credit, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Hyundai Kona Electric. For the lowest monthly payments, consider leasing an EV. Automakers offer great lease deals during certain months thanks to big incentives and the tax credit.",
      "Even with federal tax credits, a new EV is typically more expensive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle. But the resale value of EVs \u2014 essentially, how much they are worth a few years after purchase \u2014 is dropping quicker than those for gas-powered vehicles. That\u2019s great news if you\u2019re in the market for a used EV. For example, 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E GTs that cost more than $60,000 when new are now selling in the low $30,000s.",
      "However, this big drop in value isn\u2019t so great if you\u2019re the one trying to sell or trade in your used EV. You\u2019ll likely be surprised and dismayed that your vehicle is worth substantially less than what you bought it for. It\u2019s especially bad if you owe a significant amount of money on your loan. It\u2019s possible you could owe more on your loan than what the vehicle is actually worth.",
      "If you\u2019re planning on buying an EV this year, it\u2019s best to do it soon in case EV tax credits are repealed and in case prices increase. If you do purchase one, find out how to get access to Tesla charging stations because they are far easier to use than the various third-party stations.",

      "The company announced the deal a day after naming Stephen Dacus, its board chairman, to be its president and CEO.",
      "It also said it plans an initial public offering in the U.S. of 7-Eleven or SEI, its convenience store business in North America, by the end of 2026. Funds from the IPO and the sale to Bain will be returned to shareholders in the form of share buybacks worth 2 trillion yen ($5.4 billion).",

    "story": [
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices are freezing out many would-be buyers, and that's keeping the U.S. housing market in a years-long slump",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices are freezing out many would-be buyers, keeping the U.S. housing market in a sales slump dating back to 2022.",
      "While home sales are off to a soft start this year, it hasn\u2019t been all bad news for home shoppers.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage, while still near 7%, has been easing in recent weeks. And the inventory of homes for sale is up sharply from a year ago, which makes for a more buyer-friendly market than in recent years.",
      "Still, after years of skyrocketing home prices, these trends may not make much of a difference for many prospective home shoppers, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity in a property that they can use toward a new home purchase.",
      "What does this mean for the spring homebuying season?",
      "Leo Pareja, CEO of real estate brokerage eXp Realty, recently spoke to The Associated Press about his expectations for the housing market, the trajectory of mortgage rates and how home shoppers in places like Florida, Texas and other states where home listings have risen sharply are likely to have more leverage when it comes time to negotiate with sellers. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: In 2024, we ended the year roughly around 4 million resales with about 700,000 new construction. Going into the year, we feel based on the data from multiple sources, that we\u2019ll probably be up year-over-year from \u201924 to \u201825, so we\u2019re hopeful that resales end up somewhere between 4.2 million to 4.3 million, with new construction maybe increasing from 700,000 to 750,000. So, the term for us would be cautiously optimistic. That\u2019s kind of the reading of the tea leaves based on the economic data we have. But I will tell you that going into like the first 50 days of the year, the anecdotal boots on the ground feedback is kind of lining up with that thesis.",
      "A: We are hopeful that it will be slightly better than \u201924 or \u201823, because we just had this kind of constant decrease in activity starting with 2021. So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic it\u2019s going to be a little bit better.",
      "A: I think that\u2019s a fair assessment. Economics are quite simple in the supply and demand relationship of product to opportunities. I think of the buying opportunity as a three-legged stool between affordability, inventory availability and then finance ability. So one, there\u2019s more inventory to choose from, which creates more opportunity. Then the last one being the tough one, right? We don\u2019t see rates dropping by any significant levels.",
      "A: I do hear across the board that builders are being aggressive and creative in order to move their inventory. Historically speaking, the more inventory, the more flexible a seller gets and willing to contribute to concessions, which can be used for any multitude of things.",
      "A: I think the Goldilocks range is in the low 5% to really spur both buyers and sellers because they\u2019re mutually tied together on the sell side. But I don\u2019t think, based on the economic data we\u2019ve been looking at, that rates really get much of a reprieve. I\u2019ll be as bold to say in 18-to-24 months. I don\u2019t see it definitely happening in 2025. I\u2019m not betting on a big improvement in rates. But the fact that we\u2019ve kind of been in this new normal for a while, I think we no longer have the folks who are sitting on the sidelines kind of holding their breath for it to come back down to 3%."

      "Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal",
      "NEW YORK -- Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal. But, for investing at least, all this is typical.",
      "Sharp moves for the U.S. stock market, like its recent 6% drop in just a couple of weeks, happen regularly. Stomaching them is the price investors have to pay for the bigger returns that stocks can offer over other investments in the long term.",
      "This time doesn't look much different, experts say. Here's a glimpse at what's behind the market's wild moves and what experts are advising investors young and old to consider:",
      "It has certainly struggled. The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, has been dropping since setting an all-time high last month, largely because of worries about President Donald Trump's tariffs and signals that the U.S. economy is running less powerfully than economists expected.",
      "Any kind of uncertainty around the economy will give Wall Street pause. These tariffs have had a particularly jostling effect because no one knows how long Trump will go through with them. When worries are high, stocks sink sharply. When Wall Street goes back to thinking Trump is using tariffs as just a negotiating tactic, stocks have bounced back, such as on Wednesday.",
      "Yes. The S&P 500 has regularly seen declines bigger than this recent one, of 10% or more, every year or so. Often, experts view them as a culling of optimism that can otherwise run overboard, driving stock prices too high.",
      "Before this recent stumble, many critics were already saying the U.S. stock market was too expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. They also pointed to how only a handful of companies was driving so much of the market's returns. A group of just seven Big Tech companies accounted for more than half of the S&P 500's total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "Anytime an investor sees they\u2019re losing money, it feels bad. This recent run feels particularly unnerving because of how incredibly calm the market had previously been. The S&P 500 is coming off a second straight year where it shot up by more than 20%, the first time that's happened since baggy pants were last in style before the millennium.",
      "Selling may offer some feeling of relief. But it also locks in losses and prevents the chance of making the money back over time. Historically, the S&P 500 has come back from every one of its downturns to eventually make investors whole again. That includes after the Great Depression, the dot-com bust and the 2020 COVID crash.",
      "Some recoveries take longer than others, but experts often recommend not putting money into stocks that you can't afford to lose for several years, up to 10.",
      "\u201cData has shown, historically, that no one can time the market,\u201d said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub. \u201cNo one can consistently figure out the best time to buy and sell.\u201d",
      "Put another way: \u201cKeep on keeping on,\u201d suggests Chris Fasciano, vice president, investment management and research, and chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.",
      "Even as the overall U.S. stock market has dropped, some corners outside the Magnificent Seven have done much better, Fasciano said. So have stocks outside the United States.",
      "It could all be a reminder that investors often do best when they have a mixed set of investments rather than going all-in on just a few. And investors may no longer be as diversified as they thought after years of sheer dominance by the Magnificent Seven over the U.S. stock market and by Wall Street over global markets.",
      "\u201cNow\u2019s the time to revisit some of the old tried-and-true of portfolio construction, like diversification,\u201d Fasciano said.",
      "The proliferation of online trading platforms and the ease of smartphones has helped create a new generation of investors who may not be used to such volatility.",
      "But the good news is younger investors often have the gift of time. With decades to go until retirement, they can afford to ride the waves and let their stock portfolios hopefully recover before compounding and eventually growing even bigger.",
      "\u201cWe would advise younger investors to not worry about this at all,\u201d said Phil Battin, CEO of Ambassador Wealth Management. \"It\u2019s just background noise. If you have 30 to 50 years until you need the money, the economy has survived world wars, oil embargoes, presidential assassinations, Y2K, and a global pandemic. It will survive the Trump tariffs as well.\u201d",
      "This is a little trickier. \u201cIn theory, part of the appeal of crypto is that it\u2019s supposed to be a hedge investment that isn\u2019t correlated with the stock market or the fiat-currency economy,\u201d said Sam Taube, who advises investors for NerdWallet.",
      "But in reality, at least recently, crypto has often gone down in price when stocks have gone down, instead of offering that hoped-for protection during Wall Street's sell-offs. \"So, young investors may need to rethink the idea that crypto\u2019s value is completely independent of the stock market and broader economy,\u201d Taube said.",
      "Older investors have less time than younger ones to allow their investments to bounce back. But even in retirement, some people will need their investments to last 30 years or more, said Niladri \u201cNeel\u201d Mukherjee, chief investment officer of TIAA Wealth Management.",
      "People who have already retired may want to cut back on spending and withdrawals after sharp market downturns, because bigger withdrawals will remove more potential compounding ability in the future. But even retirees, at least in the early part of retirement, should still be invested in stocks to prepare for the possibility of decades of spending ahead.",
      "\u201cYou may want to slow that down and pick that back up once the market recovers,\u201d Mukherjee said, \u201cbut it all comes down to having that conversation with your adviser and your portfolio manager.\u201d",
      "No one knows, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."

      "Vendors are a fixture at Rio\u2019s Carnival street parties",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Sweat streamed down Talita Ferreira Sanches\u2019 face as she pushed a cart loaded with beer and water up the winding, cobblestone streets in Rio de Janeiro last month, calling out to glitter-covered revelers decked out in fishnet tights.",
      "The 22-year-old from an area outside Rio had spent the night sleeping on a street in bohemian neighborhood Santa Teresa, covering herself with just a sheet, so she could arrive in time for the early-morning Carnival party \u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d.",
      "\u201cCarnival represents a lot of joy and all the money that we make,\u201d said Ferreira Sanches, who has worked as a street vendor for the last four years. She makes around 1,500 reais ($260) a day during Carnival \u2014 about the same as the country's monthly minimum wage.",
      "\u201cEvery year, we have an objective. Last year we bought a fridge and a television, this year we want to buy a wardrobe and a stove,\u201d she said, pocketing cash with one hand while dishing out ice-cold drinks with the other.",
      "Like musicians and stilt walkers, vendors are a fixture at Rio's street parties. Known in Portuguese as \u201cambulantes\u201d or \u201ccamelos,\" they scour Instagram pages for times and locations, coordinate on WhatsApp groups, then race across parks and up hills, from Rio\u2019s downtown to Copacabana beach, all to place themselves and their carts in the thronging crush of thousands \u2014 or hundreds of thousands \u2014 of thirsty revelers.",
      "Peddlers provide much-needed party fuel and hydration, and can themselves partake in the buzzing, joyous atmosphere. More than that, though, it's an economic lifeline, allowing them to pay off debts, buy presents for their kids and set them up for the rest of the year.",
      "But as opportunity to cash in has grown, more and more vendors have joined the rush \u2014 and drawn pushback. There are nearly 500 registered street parties this year, and hundreds more unofficial ones, considerably more than the pre-pandemic era, and they all need cold beer and water.",
      "Rio\u2019s City Hall conducted a lottery for 15,000 authorized vendors at this year\u2019s Carnival \u2014 5,000 more than last year, but observers say there are far more vendors than spots.",
      "Selling without a permit renders them vulnerable to harassment, seizure of their merchandise and even violence from Rio\u2019s municipal guard, according to the United Street Vendors' Movement \u2014 known by its acronym MUCA.",
      "The ballooning number of vendors in recent years has created tensions with party organizers, said Pericles Monteiro, the director of Heaven on Earth, which he founded in 2001. Party facilitators and revelers have accused hawkers of blockading the procession by setting up shop in the middle of its path with their heavy carts.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t walk, we felt suffocated,\u201d Monteiro said of Heaven on Earth's procession two years ago. The group didn\u2019t get to the square where the show was supposed to end on time, and had to walk almost in silence until reaching the designated area. When they got there, peddlers had barbecues fired up and vans parked in the street, leaving little room for performers, musicians or revelers.",
      "\u201cWe support street vendors. People have to work and they have an important role. We are aware of that. But the way it has been done, the intensity \u2014 there really has been a serious problem hindering the party\u2019s development,\u201d Monteiro added.",
      "Vendors are aware of the grievances, and the impact on their reputation. This year, union SindInformal and other groups launched a campaign to promote respect, proper organization and security during Carnival, and recommended buying from vendors surrounding the party rather than in the middle of the mayhem.",
      "Fear of repercussions and clashes also prompted MUCA to produce a manifesto this year calling for \u201cmess with harmony.\u201d The document said criticism and attacks targeting vendors spark backlash against an already marginalized community.",
      "\u201cVendors are seen as dangerous, as tarnishing the city\u2019s reputation, as causing public disorder,\u201d said Fl\u00e1via Magalh\u00e3es, who researches street sellers at the Paulista University in Sao Paulo. \u201cBut vendors sustain a festive street culture that is very important for the city\u2019s tourism.\u201d",
      "They also face dire working conditions, struggling to access toilets, working long hours without stopping for food and struggling to find a legal place to leave their merchandise, according to a 2019 report by MUCA and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They often spend hours on public transport each day trekking into the city from the poor periphery.",
      "During Carnival, being based in the city center is a game-changer, said Maria de Lourdes do Carmo, 50, known as Maria of the Street Vendors.",
      "Do Carmo has been a vendor for three decades, often hawking caipirinhas to foreign tourists in Santa Teresa's cobblestone hills; the municipal guard doesn't tend to crackdown up there, she said. She ran for a city council seat in last year\u2019s election to fight for greater respect for her peers, but lost.",
      "Since last year, Rio state's public prosecutors have been leading discussions on preventing violence against itinerant workers while also trying to tackle the municipality's failure to better organize their activity, for example by providing sanctioned deposits for their goods.",
      "And City Hall this year is attending to a long-standing demand for childcare services. Authorities will provide a daycare center for vendors\u2019 children during street parties and samba schools\u2019 parades, with food, cultural activities and games, Rio\u2019s department of social assistance said in an email.",
      "For D\u00e9bora Silva Pereira, 42, enduring the long, exhausting days away from her family is worth it, firstly because Carnival buoys her family's income. On a good day, she makes 3,000 reais \u2014 what she normally earns in 10 days during the rest of the year, selling women's clothing. But she also enjoys the mixture of work and play.",
      "\u201cWe meet people and make friends. The money makes it worth it, but experiences even more so,\u201d she said."

      "Pregnant players on the women\u2019s tennis tour now can receive 12 months of paid maternity leave, and those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption can get two months off with pay",
      "Pregnant players on the women's tennis tour now can receive 12 months of paid maternity leave, and those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption can get two months off with pay, under a program sponsored by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and announced Thursday by the WTA.",
      "\u201cIndependent contractors and self-employed individuals don\u2019t typically have these kinds of maternity benefits provided and available to them. They have to go out and sort of figure out those benefits for themselves,\u201d WTA CEO Portia Archer said. \u201cThis is really sort of novel and groundbreaking.\u201d",
      "More than 300 players are eligible for the fund, which is retroactive to Jan. 1. The WTA would not disclose how much money is involved.",
      "The program \u2014 which the WTA touted as \u201cthe first time in women\u2019s sports history that comprehensive maternity benefits are available to independent, self-employed athletes\u201d \u2014 also provides grants for fertility treatments, including egg freezing and IVF.",
      "It's part of a wider trend: As women's sports rise, there is an emphasis on meeting maternity and parental needs.",
      "The WTA says 25 moms are active on tour; one, Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Belinda Bencic, won a title last month after returning from maternity leave in October.",
      "More and more pros in tennis have returned to action after having children, including past No. 1-ranked players and Grand Slam title winners such as Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Kim Clijsters, Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka.",
      "Azarenka \u2014 a member of the WTA Players' Council, which Archer acknowledged played a key role in pushing for this fund \u2014 thinks these benefits will encourage lower-ranked or lower-earning athletes to take as much time off as they feel they need after becoming a parent, rather than worrying about losing out on income while not entering tournaments.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s certainly one of the aims of the program: to provide the financial resources, the flexibility, the support, so that these athletes, regardless of where they\u2019re ranked, but particularly those who earn less, will have that agency ... to decide when and how they want to start their families,\u201d Archer said.",
      "And, Azarenka said, this could lead some players to decide to become parents before retiring from the sport for good.",
      "\u201cEvery feedback we\u2019ve heard from players who are mothers \u2014 or who are not mothers \u2014 is like, \u2018Wow, this is an incredible opportunity for us,\u2019\u201d said 2012-13 Australian Open champion Azarenka, whose son, Leo, is 8. \u201cI believe it\u2019s really going to change the conversation in sports. But going beyond sports, it\u2019s a global conversation, and I\u2019m happy that we're (part of it).\u201d",
      "Other steps the WTA has taken in recent years to benefit players include steering more women into coaching, implementing safeguarding, attempting to stem cyberbullying, and increasing prize money with an eye to pay that equals what men receive in the sport.",
      "The Public Investment Fund, or PIF, became the WTA's global partner last year, after much public debate \u2014 Hall of Famers Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were among the critics \u2014 over questions about LGBTQ+ and women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The kingdom now hosts the season-ending WTA Finals and an ATP event for rising stars of men's tennis. The PIF sponsors the WTA and ATP rankings.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been able to provide the benefits were it not for this relationship and the funding that PIF provides,\u201d Archer said.",
      "In golf, which like tennis is an individual sport without guaranteed salaries, the LPGA introduced an updated maternity leave policy in 2019 that lets athletes have the same playing status when they return.",
      "In soccer, both the NWSL and the U.S. women\u2019s national team have collective bargaining agreements that allow for pregnancy leave and parental leave; the NWSL pays the full base salary while an athlete is pregnant.",
      "In basketball, the WNBA's CBA guarantees full pay during maternity leave.",
      "For tennis, Azarenka said, the PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program is \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's an incredible beginning. Monumental change,\" she said. \"But I think we can look into how we can expand this fund for bigger, better things.\u201d",

      "The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court",
      "PARIS -- The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court.",
      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks. The online attacks erupted after Jolly\u2019s acclaimed but controversial opening spectacle on the Seine in July \u2014 a queer-inclusive, high-energy fusion of tradition and modernity.",
      "Local media reported that Jolly did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing, with two of the people charged also not attending because they were either sick or could not make themselves available.",
      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",
      "The arrests were seen as a first step in France\u2019s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities noted has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly\u2019s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing \u201cpack behavior\u201d of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns.",
      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "The donation to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Foundation is from Ross Stevens, the founder and CEO of Stone Ridge Holdings Group, a finance firm that focuses on \u201cnontraditional\u201d investment options such as crypto and fine art.",
      "\u201cI do not believe that financial insecurity should stop our nation\u2019s elite athletes from breaking through to new frontiers of excellence,\u201d Stevens said in a statement announcing the deal Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. is among the few countries whose government does not fund its Olympic program or its athletes. The U.S. team is dependent on sponsorship and media deals (for around 75-80% of its revenue), along with fundraising (for between 10-20%).",
      "It leads to a system full of Olympians who live near the poverty line while chasing their sports dreams, and can end up there in retirement, as well. The foundation's president, Christine Walshe, said last year that 57% of U.S. athletes earn $50,000 or less a year.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want athletes being destitute when they finish a long, storied career,\u201d USOPF chair Geoff Yang said, calling the gift \u201ctransformational.\u201d",
      "The Stevens donation alone is worth more than double the $47 million USOPF raised in 2023, the last year for which tax records are available. His donation provides the starting money for a program that:",
      "\u2014 Will pay a $100,000 grant, divided over four years, to every U.S. Olympian, starting with those on next year\u2019s Winter team competing in Italy. That money can be used for any purpose and can be accessed 20 years after their qualifying Olympics or once they reach 45, whichever comes later.",
      "\u2014 Will pay a $100,000 benefit to a designated beneficiary upon their death.",
      "\u2014 Will duplicate these benefits for every Olympics an athlete makes, so someone who goes three times would get a total of $600,000 in benefits.",
      "\u2014 Will be restricted to athletes who make less than $1 million a year, so as not to divert funds to, say, well-paid NBA players or top tennis stars who also compete for America.",
      "\u2014 Is funded through at least 2032 with a goal of going beyond that.",
      "The foundation, launched in 2013 as the chairtable arm of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, raised around $230 million in the four years ending in 2024 to fund direct support to athletes. It is shooting for $500 million for the four-year period ending with the LA Olympics in 2028.",
      "The USOPC's chair, Gene Sykes, called the Stevens donation \u201cthe biggest thing that anyone's ever done to address\u201d the need to help Olympians past their retirements.",
      "He said in addition to the money itself, a donation of this size by a donor with Stevens' background is a symbol of what the Olympics truly stand for.",
      "\u201cIt signifies that this is something that's valuable for the country, and valuable to people who have the greatest amount of resources in the country and take responsibility for other people who need them,\u201d Sykes said.",

      "COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Auburn coach Bruce Pearl knew exactly why his top-ranked team fell to No. 22 Texas A&M on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cThey just physically dominated us,\u201d he said.",
      "The Aggies never trailed in the 83-72 victory which snapped a season-long four-game skid.",
      "It was Texas A&M\u2019s first-ever win over a team ranked No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll and ends a six-game winning streak for the Tigers, who clinched the Southeastern Conference title with a win over Kentucky on Saturday.",
      "Auburn has held the top spot in the poll for eight straight weeks and was a unanimous No. 1 pick for a second consecutive week.",
      "Pearl denied that Auburn looked past the Aggies after wrapping up the conference championship this weekend. He said their struggles were simply a matter of A&M playing better Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cThey physically manhandled us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if this team is going to continue to win, we\u2019re going to run up against teams like Texas A&M or like Florida or like Duke that are big and physical.\u201d",
      "The Aggies entered the game leading the nation in offensive rebounding and Pearl pointed to their 24-9 advantage in this game as evidence of their physicality.",
      "\u201cWe have no excuses to allow those guys to get 24 offensive rebounds,\u201d he said. \u201cI give Texas A&M all the credit. Our guys were physically dominated\u2026 so no, I don\u2019t excuse our guys at all. We\u2019re better than that, but not tonight.\u201d",
      "Hearing Pearl\u2019s comments about the Aggies meant a lot to Texas A&M coach Buzz Williams, who said physicality and communication are the two most important things he tries to teach.",
      "\u201cWe have to play incredibly physical, and I think we have to do a lot of the things that are not necessarily in the stat sheet for for us to win,\u201d Williams said.",
      "The Tigers were also hurt by an off night from top scorer Johni Broome, who entered the game averaging 18.4 points but managed just eight. He left the game for a couple of minutes early in the first half with what appeared to be a shoulder injury but played 32 minutes despite the problem.",
      "\u201cIt may have affected him,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cHe obviously had a shoulder injury in December. He had it banged a few times and it he obviously had it banged (Tuesday) and it was bothering him. He tried to play through it.\u201d",
      "Along with Broome\u2019s struggles Tuesday, the Tigers were also without one of their top defenders in Denver Jones, who sat out with an ankle injury.",
      "\u201cDenver\u2019s the best one-on-one cover guy I got,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cSo obviously missing Denver was a factor.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NASCAR has filed a counterclaim against Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports alleging they \u201cwillfully\u201d violated antitrust laws in connection with the most recent charter agreements",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NASCAR's revenue-sharing charter system is under threat of being disbanded according to a Wednesday counterclaim filed by the stock car series against Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports that singles out Jordan's longtime business manager.",
      "The contentiousness began after more than two years of negotiations on new charter agreements \u2014 NASCAR's equivalent of a franchise model \u2014 and the 30-page filing contends that Jordan business manager Curtis Polk \u201cwillfully\u201d violated antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in connection with the most recent charter agreements.",
      "23XI and Front Row were the only two organizations out of 15 that refused to sign the new agreements, which were presented to the teams last September in a take-it-or-leave-it offer a mere 48 hours before the start of NASCAR's playoffs.",
      "The charters were fought for by the teams ahead of the 2016 season and twice have been extended. The latest extension is for seven years to match the current media rights deal and guarantee 36 of the 40 spots in each week's field to the teams that hold them, as well as other financial incentives. 23XI and Front Row refused to sign and sued, alleging NASCAR and the France family that owns the stock car series are a monopoly.",
      "NASCAR already has lost one round in court in which the two teams have been recognized as chartered organizations for the 2025 season as the legal dispute winds through the courts.",
      "In the new counterclaim, Polk is repeatedly singled out as the ringleader against the current charter proposals. NASCAR attorney Christopher Yates went so far as to tell The Associated Press that Polk, who in addition to being Jordan's business manager is a co-owner of 23XI along with three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, does not understand the NASCAR business model.",
      "\u201cCurtis Polk basically orchestrated and threatened a boycott of one of the qualifying races for a major event and others did not go along with him,\u201d Yates said. \u201cHe got other teams to boycott a meeting that was required by the charter. When you have a threatened boycott of qualifying races that are covered by media that's not a good thing for other race teams, not a good thing when you are trying to collectively grow the sport.\"",
      "The qualifying race in question was the 2024 pair of 150-mile duels that set the field for the Daytona 500.",
      "\u201cI don't think Mr. Polk really understands the sport,\u201d Yates told the AP. \u201cI think he came into it and his view is it should be much more like the NBA or other league sports. But it's not. No motorsport is like that. He's done a lot of things that might work in the NBA or might be OK in the NBA but just are not appropriate in NASCAR.\u201d",
      "NASCAR's complaint alleges \u201cthe undisputed reality is that it is 23XI and FRM, led by 23XI\u2019s owner and sports agent Curtis Polk, that willfully violated the antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in connection with the terms of the 2025 Charter Agreements.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is truly ironic that in trying to blow-up the Charter system, 23XI and FRM have sought to weaponize the antitrust laws to achieve their goals,\" the counterclaim says, alleging Polk's threats are \u201cattempting to misuse the legal system as a last resort to secure new terms.\u201d",
      "Bob Jenkins, an entrepreneur, owns Front Row Motorsports and joined 23XI in the lawsuit when he declined to sign the 2025 charter agreement last September.",
      "NASCAR's counterclaim asks for an injunction eliminating guaranteed starting spots for charter teams. NASCAR wants the four combined charters held by 23XI and Front Row before the lawsuit to be returned to NASCAR, and it wants to dissolve the two charters each team purchased ahead of the 2025 season for their own individual expansion.",
      "\u201cThere's a misperception out there that somehow 23IX and Front Row might achieve something that other teams can take advantage of, and that's just not right,\u201d Yates told the AP. \"This is not going to be a renegotiation. NASCAR has no intent of renegotiating the terms of the charter. Front Row and 23XI are threatening the charter system and its continuation, and NASCAR is fine without the charter system.",
      "\u201cThe charter system was created at the request of the teams. That was before 23XI and Curtis Polk's time, I don't think they understand that history. But if they succeed with their lawsuit and the charter system goes away, that's OK.\u201d",
      "Yates told the AP he's asked Jeffrey Kessler, the attorney representing 23XI and Front Row, what is it the two teams want and cannot get a straight answer.",
      "\u201cThe mere fact that the lawsuit calls the system into question, I really think 23XI and Front Row are being pretty selfish in terms of what they are trying to do, and I don't think they are taking into account the 32 teams that have signed the charters and think it is a good deal for them,\" Yates said. \u201cDo some of them think they should have gotten more? I'm sure. Does NASCAR think it should have gotten more? Absolutely. But NASCAR does not see the charter system as necessary.\u201d",
      "Jordan has said he's suing NASCAR on behalf of all the teams so that even the smallest ones can receive equal footing in terms of benefits as a participant in the top motorsports league in the United States.",
      "Among the improvements in the 2025 charters is a more equitable revenue share, but missing is the demand that teams wanted the charters to become permanent. NASCAR at its discretion can claw back charters from underperforming teams or eliminate the system completely. Yates said NASCAR has no intention of renegotiating the charters signed in September by 13 organizations, nor did he see a scenario in which NASCAR settles the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cPolk and 23XI\u2019s other owners openly professed that they wanted to change NASCAR\u2019s economic model by demanding more money for the teams from NASCAR media revenues, instead of teams competing against each other,\" Yates said. \u201cHowever, 23XI and FRM did not merely reject the terms of the 2025 Charters. Rather, those teams embarked on a strategy to threaten, coerce, and extort NASCAR into meeting their demands for better contract and financial terms.\u201d",

      "LAKE PLACID, N.Y. -- The latest addition to the list of amenities available to athletes at the bobsled and skeleton world championships is a room inside a lodge just down the hill from the finish line. There are some stuffed animals, tons of toys, Mickey Mouse coloring books and big boxes of crayons.",
      "This is the family space. These days, it\u2019s a needed part of the sliding circuit.",
      "There are four mothers expected to compete in the world championships that got officially underway Thursday in Lake Placid \u2014 U.S. skeleton athlete Kelly Curtis, Swiss bobsledder Nadja Pasternack, and U.S. bobsledders Elana Meyers Taylor and Kaillie Humphries. It\u2019s believed to be the highest number of mothers racing at a world championships.",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t forgotten about us,\u201d Curtis said.",
      "All four women missed time from competing during their pregnancies \u2014 for Meyers Taylor, it\u2019s been two absences, since she\u2019s a mom of two now. But the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, the governing body for those two sports, decided in recent years to protect women who wanted to add to their families by ensuring that they didn\u2019t lose their world rankings while taking the time off.",
      "That means they were able to jump right back into World Cup racing when they were ready to do so \u2014 and not having to start from the bottom of the rankings means the path to qualify for the next Olympics in February 2026 became a bit easier for all of them.",
      "\u201cI wanted to be able to prove to myself that I could come back,\u201d said Humphries, the only three-time Olympic gold medalist in women\u2019s bobsled history. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to feed into what I heard for the majority of my career, that having a baby ends your career. I didn\u2019t want that to be the case. And so, a big part for me was proving I could come back and do it, regardless of the results, regardless of how it all plays out.\u201d",
      "The kids seem to have their own followings at the track at this point. Bobsled and skeleton sliders are relatively close-knit, with people seeing the same people at tracks around the world all winter. Meyers Taylor, Humphries and Curtis have all said since becoming mothers that they rely on their friends and teammates for help when needed, and for the most part they travel with their partners or families for support.",
      "In a social media post earlier this year, Meyers Taylor discussed how her sons were both born deaf and how one also has Down Syndrome \u2014 and how the decision to have them with her on the World Cup circuit was not an easy one to make.",
      "\u201cMy fears were quickly laid to rest as I quickly realized not only would they have the opportunity to see the world, they would have an immense amount love poured into them on a daily basis by my (U.S.) teammates and the many, many friends I\u2019ve made throughout my years with bobsled,\u201d wrote Meyers Taylor, who has a record five women\u2019s Olympic bobsled medals.",
      "Pasternack \u2014 who gave birth in December 2023, after going into labor while cheering Swiss teammates on at a race in La Plagne, France \u2014 returned to sliding just 12 weeks ago, and made her way into the world championships with relative ease.",
      "\u201cBack like she never left,\u201d German bobsledder Laura Nolte said.",
      "Meyers Taylor and Humphries were tied for sixth in the World Cup standings this season in two-woman bobsled. Meyers Taylor was eighth in the world monobob standings this season with a pair of wins and conceivably could have been as high as fifth if the Americans hadn\u2019t skipped the last race of the season to prepare for worlds. Curtis \u2014 who is a member of the U.S. Air Force, stationed in Italy, and someone who gave birth a little over a year ago \u2014 struggled for much of the season before hitting her best stride at the end; back-to-back seventh-place showings got her into the world championships.",
      "It\u2019s not new for moms to be competing as sliders. Curtis remembers the scene at the 2014 Olympics when U.S. skeleton athlete Noelle Pikus-Pace \u2014 then a mother of two \u2014 won a silver medal in Sochi and ran into the stands to celebrate with her family. That was the moment when Curtis decided to try sliding.",
      "\u201cThe postpartum period, hormones, everything, the recalibration calibration has kind of taken me by a little bit more of a surprise,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m back pushing to where I used to be, and I think the mind-body connection for the actual sliding, relaxation, part is taking longer to come back than I thought.\u201d",
      "No matter what happens over the next two weeks, whether medals are won or lost, the kids won\u2019t care much. Humphries \u2014 one of the most driven athletes in the sport \u2014 says the challenge just of getting pregnant (she and her husband spent a fortune on fertility treatments before finally having success) and now being a mother has brought newfound perspective.",
      "It\u2019s a challenge for dads, too. U.S. bobsledder Frank Del Duca doesn\u2019t have his child with him when he travels the world and makes no secret of how difficult that is. But he marvels at what Curtis, Humphries, Meyers Taylor and Pasternack can do.",
      "\u201cTo have their body go through that transformation hormonally and to be able to provide for another human being, then to turn around and start lifting weights, sprinting, traveling, competing and winning on the world stage is one of the most impressive things I\u2019ve witnessed in sport,\u201d Del Duca said. \u201cAnd they do it with a smile.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",

      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "Teaching machines in the way that animal trainers mold the behavior of dogs or horses has been an important method for developing artificial intelligence and one that was recognized Wednesday with the top computer science award.",
      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",
      "In a joint interview with the AP, Barto and Sutton didn't always agree on how to evaluate the risks of AI agents that are constantly seeking to improve themselves. They also distinguished their work from the branch of generative AI technology that is currently in fashion \u2014 the large language models behind chatbots made by OpenAI, Google and other tech giants that mimic human writing and other media.",
      "\u201cThe big choice is, do you try to learn from people\u2019s data, or do you try to learn from an (AI) agent\u2019s own life and its own experience?\u201d Sutton said.",
      "Sutton has dismissed what he describes as overblown concerns about AI's threat to humanity, while Barto disagreed and said \u201cYou have to be cognizant of potential unexpected consequences.\u201d",
      "Barto, retired for 14 years, describes himself as a Luddite, while Sutton is embracing a future he expects to have beings of greater intelligence than current humans \u2014 an idea sometimes known as posthumanism.",
      "\u201cPeople are machines. They\u2019re amazing, wonderful machines,\u201d but they are also not the \u201cend product\u201d and could work better, Sutton said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intrinsically a part of the AI enterprise,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand ourselves and, of course, to make things that can work even better. Maybe to become such things.\u201d",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "A new study says early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.",
      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",

      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",

      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird.

However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Molly Kelly was stunned to discover in June that someone she knew had used widely available \u201cnudification\u201d technology to create highly realistic and sexually explicit videos and images of her, using family photos that were posted on social media.",
      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",
      "\u201cThis cannot continue,\" she said. \"These tech companies cannot keep unleashing this technology into the world with no consequences. It is harmful by its very nature.\u201d",

      "A private lunar lander has touched down on the moon, delivering a drill and other experiments for NASA",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",
      "NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox.",
      "\u201cIt really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,\" Fox said.",
      "Unlike NASA\u2019s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",

      "NASA clinches the space race with the Soviets in 1969 with a moon landing by Apollo 11\u2019s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Twelve astronauts explore the surface over six missions, before the program ends with Apollo 17 in 1972.

A sample return mission on the moon\u2019s near side in 2020 yields nearly 4 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of lunar rocks and dirt. Another sample return mission from the far side in 2024 delivers rocks and soil from the less explored part of the moon .

      "After its first lander slams into the moon in 2019, India regroups and launches Chandrayaan-3 (Hindi for moon craft) in 2023. The craft successfully touches down, making India the fourth country to score a lunar landing. The win comes just four days after Russia\u2019s crash-landing.",
      "Japan becomes the fifth country to land successfully on the moon, with its spacecraft touching down in January. The craft lands on the wrong side, compromising its ability to generate solar power, but manages to crank out pictures and science before falling silent when the long lunar night sets in.",
      "A privately funded lander from Israel, named Beresheet, Hebrew for \u201cin the beginning,\u201d crashes into the moon in 2019. A Japanese entrepreneur\u2019s company, ispace, launches a lunar lander in 2023, but it, too, wrecks.",

      "On Thursday, ten Democrats supported the censure resolution: Reps. Ami Bera of California, Ed Case of Hawaii, Jim Costa of California, Laura Gillen of New York, Jim Himes of Connecticut, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Wahsingont and Tom Suozzi of New York.",
      "But many Democrats criticized the resolution.",
      "\"That censure vote was outrageous to my mind,\" Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told ABC News about Green's vote. \"What they've done is they've completely watered down the meaning of censure. Censuring people over heckling. Of course, now we'll have to start censuring Marjorie Taylor Greene, she repeatedly heckled President Biden.\"",
      "\"We know that we've seen Marjorie [Taylor Greene] yell at Joe Biden. There was no outrage. None. So there shouldn't be any outrage today,\" Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett said on ABC News Live.",
      "When asked about the 10 Democrats who supported the censure, Crockett said, \"I don't know their reason or their rational, but I know I voted the way that I did and at the end of the day if my district decides I need to go because I voted that way then so be it. But I stand with Al Green.\"",
      "Moments before the vote, Johnson had told ABC News he took \"no pleasure in making history like this\" and hoped Green would \"acknowledge his mistake.\"",
      "\"I want us to have proper decorum. I want us to maintain really the great tradition of this institution,\" Johnson said. \"And these things do damage to it and I'm sorry that it happened.\"",
      "Green was ejected from the joint session on Tuesday after interrupting the president's speech and refusing to sit down despite warnings from Johnson. Green said multiple times he was not upset with Johnson for removing him or for overseeing the censure vote.",
      "\"He chose to deliberately violate House rules in a manner that we think is probably unprecedented in history -- interrupting a message of a president of the United States, who is an honored guest,\" Johnson explained ahead of the vote.",

      "However, in a separate case, the St. John's Hospital System in Idaho was able to obtain a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from going into effect, court documents show.",
      "The federal case -- filed under the previous administration but now being dropped by the Trump administration -- claimed the Idaho abortion ban violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, a federal law that requires all hospitals that receive Medicare funding to provide \"stabilizing care\" to all patients whose health is in danger, according to the law.",
      "Idaho's total abortion ban went into effect in August 2022, prohibiting nearly all abortions with exceptions for reported cases of rape or incest or when \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho over the ban arguing that EMTALA preempts the state abortion ban and requires emergency room physicians to provide abortions not just if needed to save the life of the mother but also to prevent serious health consequences.",
      "The highly publicized case reached the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The court dismissed the case and sent it back to a lower court. That decision allowed emergency abortions to resume in Idaho.",
      "Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending federal protections for abortion rights and laying the pathway for states to prohibit abortion care. He has said he supports exceptions for abortions in cases of rape and incest, but said it should be left up to the states to decide how to regulate the procedure.",

      "With more than 100 federal lawsuits filed since the inauguration, Trump and his administration have effectively been sued three times for every business day he has occupied the Oval Office.",
      "Approximately 30 of the 100 lawsuits relate to Trump's immigration policies, while more than 20 of the cases directly challenge the actions of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Ten of the cases challenge Trump policies relating to transgender people, and more than 20 cases oppose the president's unilateral changes to federal funding, government hiring and the structure of agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "With Trump signing more than 75 executive orders since taking office, the unprecedented flood of litigation has yielded mixed results in blocking the president's unilateral efforts to reshape the federal government. His attempts to freeze funding or rewrite longstanding laws have generally been blocked, but some federal judges have implicitly given him the green light to carry out part of his plan to reshape the federal workforce.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour -- who was nominated to the bench by Ronald Reagan -- handed the Trump administration one of its first legal defeats by blocking Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship and offered one of the fiercest criticisms of his presidency's early actions.",
      "\"It has become ever more apparent that to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals,\" Judge Coughenour said. \"There are moments in the world's history when people look back and ask, 'Where were the lawyers, where were the judges? In these moments, the rule of law becomes especially vulnerable. I refuse to let that beacon go dark today.\"",
      "But other judges have stopped short of fully blocking policies they believe might be unlawful, demonstrating how a slower-moving judiciary can be outpaced by a rapidly moving administration. In a case challenging the Trump administration's effort to fire thousands of probationary employees, U.S. District Judge William Alsup rebuked the administration's actions but did not step in to stop the indiscriminate firing of employees, despite acknowledging its ongoing harm.",
      "\"That's just not right in our country \u2013 that we run our agencies with lies like that and stain somebody's record for the rest of their life? Who is going to want to work in a government that would do that to them? Probationary employees are the lifeblood of our government,\" he said.",
      "The number of lawsuits appear to have tested the limits of the court's ability to hear emergency applications, particularly in the District Court in D.C., where 51 of the cases have been brought. During one contentious hearing, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes threatened to sanction a lawyer who pushed the court to accept an emergency appeal while court staff had been \"working around the clock on really monumental time sensitive issues,\" Reyes said.",
      "\"Why on earth could you not have figured that out with the defendants before coming and burdening me and burdening the defendants and burning my staff on this issue?\" Reyes told Seth Waxman, a former U.S. Solicitor General under President Bill Clinton who is now representing eight former inspectors general fired by Trump.",
      "Lawsuits challenging the Trump administration have reached the Supreme Court twice, and the Department of Justice has begun their appeals to the Circuit Court in approximately a dozen cases.",
      "While no judge has found that the president has openly defied a court order, the Trump administration has found itself in hot water for failing to comply with multiple court orders, including orders to stop unilaterally freezing funding to states and holding back more than $1.9 billion in foreign aid.",
      "On Wednesday, the Supreme Court narrowly denied the Trump administration's request to block that payment, marking the first time during this administration that the Supreme Court ruled against the president who nominated three of the court's nine justices. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito remarked that he was \"stunned\" by the decision.",

    "summary": "During an address to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said childhood cancer rates have increase by 40%. Data shows there may be some context missing.",
    "story": [
      "While rates have been increasing, mortality has decreased.",
      "During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, President Donald Trump spoke about childhood cancer rates, saying it was a priority of his administration to tackle this issue.",
      "\"Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent,\" Trump said during his speech. \"Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\"",
      "The president also took time to highlight a 13-year-old brain cancer survivor, whom he invited as a special guest to attend his address.",
      "Although it's unclear where Trump got the 40% figure, data shows that childhood cancer rates have indeed been increasing over the past several decades. However, a pediatric oncologist told ABC News that there's important context missing in that statement, such as the effect of advances in early detection and possible environmental factors.",
      "\"It's accurate to say that these diagnoses have gone up in the tracking data,\" Dr. John Prensner, an assistant professor of pediatrics and of biological chemistry in the department of cancer biology at the University of Michigan School of Medicine, told ABC News. \"I think the context for these numbers is incredibly important and that's what I think has been left out, perhaps, of the conversation.\"",
      "Additionally, childhood cancer treatments have been improving and the number of childhood cancer survivors is increasing, Prensner said.",
      "A study published early this year in the journal PLOS One that was conducted by researchers in the U.S., Germany and Jordan found that childhood cancer rates in America have increased by approximately 33% since 1975.",
      "The study found that the incidence of childhood cancer rose from 14.23 cases per 100,000 children between 1975 and 1979 to about 18.89 cases per 100,00 children between 2010 and 2019.",
      "The increase was found in certain types of cancer including leukemias, lymphomas, brain tumors, hepatic tumors, and gonadal germ cell tumors, according to the study.",
      "Additionally, a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that over the past 40 years, the number of children diagnosed with leukemia has increased by about 35%.",
      "These trends mirror what has been seen in older populations, with cancer rates also increasing in adults under age 50.",
      "Prensner said scientists believe there are many likely reasons why childhood cancer rates are increasing.",
      "One reason is better detection and the dramatic improvement in medical tests over the past several decades, according to Prensner, who said many of the tests that are now commonly used didn't exist 50 years ago.",
      "\"These include dramatic, dramatic improvements in the ways that we can image patients with CAT scans and MRI scans,\" Prensner told ABC News. \"This includes improvements in the way that we monitor and screen certain patients. We have much more information now about patients who may have what's called a cancer syndrome, meaning they're at a higher risk to develop cancer.\"",
      "\"In those patients, we actively monitor them to be able to make early diagnoses before cancers are able to spread, and so those patients may not have been monitored in prior decades because we didn't have that scientific information,\" he added.",
      "Prensner said he is not an expert in the risk of cancer from environmental exposures but that data suggests those factors may also be playing a role in the increase of childhood cancer rates.",
      "A study from March 2024 that analyzed over 200 previous studies found that exposure to pesticides, hazardous air pollutants, chemicals like benzene, and vehicular emissions has been linked to higher rates of childhood cancers, particularly leukemia.",
      "While childhood cancer rates have increased, childhood cancer mortality rates have significantly declined over the past decades. Between 2001 and 2021, the cancer death rate for U.S. children and teens aged 19 and younger decreased by 24%, from 2.75 to 2.10 per 100,000 individuals, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Prensner said there are close to 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S., many of whom are now adults, indicating that more children are surviving cancer, likely due to advancements in medical treatments and early detection.",
      "\"There are some types of childhood cancers that are associated with congenital anomalies or birth defects, and patients who are born with those different disorders also receive better care now, such that they may have a higher cancer rate now, because they're living longer, whereas they may not have lived nearly as long in 1980,\" Prensner said.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said she was \"encouraged\" to see President Trump shine a light on childhood cancer rates.",
      "\"While pediatric cancer incidence has increased in the last few decades, the cancer mortality rate among children and adolescents younger than 20 years declined by more than 50% from 1975 to 2022, according to the National Cancer Institute; though lasting effects from treatment persist,\" Lacasse said. \"This progress in survival has been possible thanks to investments in research and breakthroughs in treatment.\"",

    "summary": "The Mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City testified in front of the House Oversight Committee during a blockbuster hearing on sanctuary cities",
    "story": [
      "The mayors pushed back on GOP assertions that they are welcoming criminals.",
      "The Democratic mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City on Wednesday pushed back against House Republicans' claims that they are harboring dangerous immigrants and violating immigration laws as so-called \"sanctuary cities.\"",
      "During a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and New York City Mayor Eric Adams all defended their actions on immigration enforcement in their respective cities as Republicans on the committee accused them of increasing crime and impeding on law enforcement actions.",
      "Chairman James Comer, a Republican, said these mayors lead towns that have policies that only create \"sanctuary for criminals\" and promised to hold them accountable for \"their failure to follow the law and protect the American people.\" Comer and other Republicans on the committee suggested that the mayors should be doing more to cooperate with the Trump administration and its deportation efforts.",
      "Sanctuary cities still enforce U.S. federal immigration laws, but the term often refers to a limited collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while enacting policies that are more favorable to undocumented people.",
      "\"As mayor, I do not control who enters or remains in our country, but I do have to manage the population that is within our city,\" said Adams, who said as New York City mayor he is working with the Trump administration on immigration aid. \"In order to carry out this function without having long term negative ramification, I must create an atmosphere that allows every law-abiding resident, documented or not, to access vital services without fear of being turned over to federal authorities.\"",
      "Wu said that the Trump administration is making \"hard-working, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives.\"",
      "\"A city that's scared is not a city that's safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free,\" Wu said.",
      "Democrats immediately criticized the Trump administration, arguing the overreach of federal officials has led to unlawful detentions and created fear in communities.",
      "\"Let's be clear, the state and local laws that Republicans have issue with today are in full compliance with federal law. They do not obstruct ICE from carrying out its duties, and they are backed by evidence demonstrating that they keep people safe,\" Ranking Member Gerry Connolly said.",
      "Wednesday's committee hearing comes as President Donald Trump's administration officials have ramped up their immigration enforcement efforts with Attorney General Pam Bondi shutting down federal grants to sanctuary cities and multiple threats from \"border czar\" Tom Homan toward these mayors if they refuse to comply.",
      "At the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Homan criticized Boston and its police commissioner, saying he'll be \"bringing hell\" to the city over its sanctuary city policy.",
      "\"Let's talk about Tom Homan,\" Wu said Wednesday. \"Shame on him for lying about my city, for having the nerve to insult our police commissioner who has overseen the safest Boston's been in anyone's lifetime. Bring him here under oath, and let's ask him some questions.\"",
      "The mayors pushed back heavily on assertions from Republicans that they are welcoming criminals into their cities, blaming the Trump administration for labeling immigrants as criminals and pushing misleading crime statistics.",
      "\"If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms,\" Wu later added. \"Stop cutting Medicaid. Stop cutting cancer research. Stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our cities safe.\"",
      "Many Republican lawmakers pointed to specific incidents in each of the mayor's cities about U.S. citizens getting injured or killed at the hands of undocumented people, attempting to dispel the mayors' arguments.",
      "Republican Rep. Jim Jordan got in a contentious back-and-forth with Johnston involving a Venezuelan gang member who injured officers during an arrest. Due to the state's sanctuary city policy, police were forced to arrest the man in public rather than travel into the jail to detain him, something the Republicans criticized.",
      "Republican Rep. Nancy Mace had harsh words for the mayors, saying \"you all have blood on your hands\" over deaths and injuries at the hands of these undocumented people.",
      "\"All of the mayors here today are actively working to harm the American people you represent,\" Mace said. \"You all have blood on your hands.\"",
      "As the committee members accused the mayors of interfering with Trump's deportation efforts, the mayors continued to assert that they were in compliance with federal law.",
      "However, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna disputed the mayor's claims and argued that the sanctuary city policies were in violation of federal law, announcing she was going to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department.",
      "\"I do not think you guys are bad people, but I think that you are ideologically misled, which is why, unfortunately, based on your responses, I'm all going to be criminally referring you to the Department of Justice for investigation, and as soon as I leave here, these will be going over to Pam Bondi,\" Luna said.",
      "\"I'm not doing that ... [in] an effort to bully you guys, but I do believe that your policies are hurting the American people.\"",

      "The disturbing allegations came as the suspects were indicted on first-degree murder charges in the death of Sam Nordquist, whose body was found last month wrapped in plastic and dumped in a field in the Finger Lakes region.",
      "The group, who had previously been arrested for second-degree murder, were also accused of kidnapping and child endangerment in the 11-count indictment.",

      "Officials say roughly 650 Marines and Army soldiers who were forced out of the military for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine have so far expressed interest in returning to the force under an executive order from President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Roughly 650 Marines and Army soldiers who were forced out of the military for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine have so far expressed interest in returning to the force under an executive order from President Donald Trump, officials said this week.",
      "The number represents about 8% of the roughly 8,200 troops who had been discharged. The total, officials say, confirms military leaders' early view that many troops have moved on with their lives. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, and Trump's offer of providing back pay may be a factor in spurring a bit more interest now.",
      "The Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members discharged for refusing a pandemic-era order to get the vaccine. The Navy and the Air Force are planning to begin their efforts to contact service members, but are waiting for additional guidance. The totals would likely increase once their formal notices go out.",
      "Officials stressed that the numbers are very preliminary because troops have only expressed interest in reenlisting and haven't actually taken steps to formally do so. They will have to go through the enlistment procedure again, pass all required legal and moral standards and physical fitness requirements, and agree to reenlist for at least two years.",
      "Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said that the mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d",
      "Under Trump's directive, those who were discharged for refusing the vaccine can rejoin and get back pay. Those who voluntarily left to avoid the vaccine also can rejoin, but they must swear that they left the service for that reason and they will not receive back pay.",

      "In mid-February, the Defense Department told the military services to reach out once again to service members who were forced out or voluntarily left the military because of the COVID-19 vaccine and see if they want to reenlist. This time it came with the financial incentive.",
      "The Marine Corps set up a special team and has sent emails and text messages to those who were discharged. As of Wednesday, spokesman Jim Edwards said 553 Marines have responded. Of those, 455 expressed some interest in reenlisting or had additional questions about the offer, and 98 said they weren't interested.",

      "Guides from the heli-skiing company attempted to locate the skiers. Using avalanche beacons, the guides identified a probable area where the skiers were buried, at a depth of 40 feet (12 meters) to 100 feet (30 meters), McDaniel said in a later email.",
      "\u201cThe guides were unable to recover the three skiers due to the depth. Due to considerable avalanche risk in this area and limited daylight, no further recovery operations were conducted on March 4,\u201d he said. \u201cIf weather and conditions allow for it, Troopers plan to assess avalanche conditions from the air and determine recovery options with individuals that have experience making avalanche recoveries.\"",

      "In 2021, Czech billionaire Petr Kellner and four others died in a helicopter crash during a heliskiing tour near Knik Glacier, in the Chugach Mountains just north of Anchorage. A year later, a heli-ski guide scouting an area for clients died when an avalanche carried his body nearly 1500 feet (457 meters) down a mountain, Alaska State Troopers said at the time.",
      "There have been several deaths reported elsewhere this year.",
      "One person was killed in an avalanche in central Colorado on Feb. 22. Authorities in Grand County responded to what they described as a skier-triggered avalanche in a steep area known as \u201cThe Fingers\u201d above Berthoud Pass.

      "Elsewhere, three people died in avalanches Feb. 17 \u2014 one person near Lake Tahoe and two backcountry skiers in Oregon\u2019s Cascade Mountains. On Feb. 8, a well-known outdoor guide was caught in an avalanche in Utah and was killed.",

      "The Republican-led Senate has voted to confirm Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general, placing President Donald Trump\u2019s former criminal defense attorney in a key Justice Department post at a time of turmoil in the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to confirm Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general, placing President Donald Trump's former criminal defense attorney in a key Justice Department post at a time of turmoil in the agency.",
      "Blanche, who just months ago was defending Trump against indictments brought by the department, will be the second in command under Attorney General Pam Bondi, another close Trump ally. He was confirmed in a 52-46 vote.",
      "Blanche is entering amid upheaval from firings, resignations and forced transfers of career officials in the Trump administration's push to purge the agency of employees seen as disloyal to the president's agenda.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Blanche sought to assure Democrats that politics would play no role in his decisions as deputy attorney general. Blanche said Trump's Justice Department will work to restore the \u201cAmerican people\u2019s faith in our justice system\" after what he described as \u201cpartisan lawfare\u201d targeting the president.",
      "Blanche is a former federal prosecutor who was a key figure on Trump\u2019s defense team, both in the two criminal cases brought by the Justice Department and the New York hush money case, which ended in a conviction of 34 felony counts.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith has defended the cases he brought accusing Trump of conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases were withdrawn after Trump\u2019s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Emil Bove, another former Trump defense attorney who has been acting as the Justice Department's second in command while Blanche awaited confirmation, will now became the principal associate deputy attorney general.",
      "Bove has rattled the department with actions in his first weeks, including demanding the names of thousands of FBI agents who participated in the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack, and ordering the dismissal of New York Mayor Eric Adams' corruption case."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he wants his new education chief, Linda McMahon, to \u201cput herself out of a job\u201d and close the Education Department",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has said he wants his new education chief, Linda McMahon, to \u201cput herself out of a job\u201d and close the Education Department.",
      "McMahon was confirmed by the Senate on Monday, and an executive order to shutter the department could come as soon as this week. McMahon told employees it was the department\u2019s \u201cfinal mission\u201d to eliminate bureaucratic bloat and turn over the agency\u2019s authority to states.",
      "Eliminating the department altogether would be a cumbersome task, which likely would require an act of Congress.",
      "Already, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department\u2019s work.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \u201cwoke\u201d and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation\u2019s academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "The agency's main role is financial. Annually, it distributes billions in federal money to colleges and schools and manages the federal student loan portfolio. Closing the department would mean redistributing each of those duties to another agency. The Education Department also plays an important regulatory role in services for students, ranging from those with disabilities to low-income and homeless kids.",
      "Indeed, federal education money is central to Trump's plans for colleges and schools. Trump has vowed to cut off federal money for schools and colleges that push \"critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content\" and to reward states and schools that end teacher tenure and support universal school choice programs.",
      "Federal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets \u2014 roughly 14%. Colleges and universities are more reliant on it, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition.",
      "Here is a look at some of the department's key functions, and how Trump has said he might approach them.",
      "The Education Department manages approximately $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for over 40 million borrowers. It also oversees the Pell Grant, which provides aid to students below a certain income threshold, and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ), which universities use to allocate financial aid.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration made cancellation of student loans a signature effort of the department's work. Even though Biden\u2019s initial attempt to cancel student loans was overturned by the Supreme Court, the administration forgave over $175 billion for more than 4.8 million borrowers through a range of changes to programs it administers, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The loan forgiveness efforts have faced Republican pushback, including litigation from several GOP-led states.",
      "Trump has criticized Biden's efforts to cancel debt as illegal and unfair, calling it a \u201ctotal catastrophe\u201d that \u201ctaunted young people.\u201d Trump's plan for student debt is uncertain: He has not put out detailed plans.",
      "Through its Office for Civil Rights, the Education Department conducts investigations and issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied, such as for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. The office also oversees a large data collection project that tracks disparities in resources, course access and discipline for students of different racial and socioeconomic groups.",
      "Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role. Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of antisemitism above all else and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to compete on women\u2019s teams.",
      "In his campaign platform, Trump said he would pursue civil rights cases to \u201cstop schools from discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d He has described diversity and equity policies in education as \u201cexplicit unlawful discrimination\u201d and said colleges that use them will pay fines and have their endowments taxed.",
      "Trump also has pledged to exclude transgender students from Title IX protections, which affect school policies on students\u2019 use of pronouns, bathrooms and locker rooms. Originally passed in 1972, Title IX was first used as a women\u2019s rights law. Last year, Biden\u2019s administration said the law forbids discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, but a federal judge undid those protections.",
      "While the Education Department does not directly accredit colleges and universities, it oversees the system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies. Institutions of higher education must be accredited to gain access to federal money for student financial aid.",
      "Accreditation came under scrutiny from conservatives in 2022, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools questioned political interference at Florida public colleges and universities. Trump has said he would fire \u201cradical left accreditors\u201d and take applications for new accreditors that would uphold standards including \u201cdefending the American tradition\u201d and removing \u201cMarxist\u201d diversity administrators.",
      "Although the education secretary has the authority to terminate its relationship with individual accrediting agencies, it is an arduous process that has rarely been pursued. Under President Barack Obama, the department took steps to cancel accreditors for a now-defunct for-profit college chain, but the Trump administration blocked the move. The group, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, was terminated by the Biden administration in 2022.",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools goes through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, lower class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a sweeping proposal outlining a far-right vision for the country, offered a blueprint. It suggested sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",

      "Patel spoke as the Trump administration is working to bring home Americans from multiple countries, including Russia and Venezuela. The government is also trying to secure the release of remaining American hostages held by Hamas, with Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump's nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, leading direct talks with the militant group.",
      "\u201cWe still don\u2019t have everybody back,\" Patel said. \u201cWhatever lawful authorities we have at the FBI, we are going to give 24/7, 365 days to make sure that we zero out this number and to make sure we prevent others from going into situations that you are now all too familiar with.\u201d",
      "The FBI houses a multiagency fusion cell that handles hostage cases involving Americans in foreign countries. The State Department, meanwhile, relies on a special presidential envoy \u2014 the position for which Boehler has been tapped \u2014 to negotiate the release of Americans who are wrongfully detained.",
      "\u201cWhen the president asked me if there was any job that I thought that I wanted to focus on,\" Boehler said Thursday, \"I told him that this was the only one I would look at because I think there\u2019s nothing more important for this country than for everyone to know that if they\u2019re abroad and they\u2019re taken, that the country has their back.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration last month returned home Marc Fogel, an American schoolteacher jailed in Russia on drug charges, as part of a prisoner swap."

Trump has said he wants to close the department, and new Education Secretary Linda McMahon has laid out how it could be dismantled.",
      "Federal money makes up a significant portion of budgets in some rural districts, which rely more on grants and philanthropy because of their limited tax base, said Sharon Contreras, CEO of the Innovation Project, a collaboration among North Carolina school districts. A grant to that group supported teacher recruitment and retention, providing scholarships for teachers pursuing master\u2019s degrees if they agreed to return to the area and serve as principals for three years.",
      "\u201cThese districts struggle to attract teachers,\u201d Contreras said. \u201cThey struggle to attract principals because they can\u2019t compete with larger districts.\u201d",
      "Across the country, the grants paid student teachers to gain experience in classrooms, funded scholarships for aspiring teachers, and sent teachers to workshops to learn from peers. As recipients scramble to appeal the cuts, many say they could lead to fewer well-prepared teachers in classrooms, particularly in subject areas and regions already struggling with shortages.",
      "\u201cI think what\u2019s unknown at this moment is how many individuals are going to continue to go into teaching, who may just have had their scholarships disrupted,\u201d said Kathlene Campbell, CEO of the National Center for Teacher Residencies.",
      "On Monday, the teacher residencies center and the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education filed a lawsuit seeking to reverse the grant terminations. It said the cuts unlawfully targeted several grant programs authorized by Congress.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As Trump pursues plans to dismantle the Education Department, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency already has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \u201cwoke\u201d and wasteful, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "Last month, the Education Department sent letters to over a hundred grantees at universities and school districts saying teacher training programs were cut off because they involved diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives than ran afoul of the Trump administration\u2019s guidance. In a news release, it said the programs promoted what it called inappropriate topics such as critical race theory, social justice activism and instruction on white privilege.",
      "Grant recipients rejected the notion that their work was related to DEI.",
      "In rural South Carolina, one of the grants provided $13.5 million over three years to the Laurens 55 School District. It used the money to create 18 master teacher positions, train teachers, and pay bonuses when student test scores went up.",
      "The program did not include any race-based hiring or teacher training, Laurens 55 Superintendent Jody Penland said.",
      "\u201cI think there was a priority point that kind of included in the grant something about \u2018diversity,\u2019\u201d Penland said. \u201cAnd you know, we took it as in, \u2018How are we going to serve all of our kids?\u2019\"",
      "In New Orleans, the NOLA SEED program used its grant money to help teaching candidates pay tuition at Tulane University. A partner organization recruited local high school students to take introductory college courses and to consider teaching careers \u2014 all to help address teacher shortages.",
      "Another eliminated grant allowed history teacher Brian Grindrod in New Haven, Connecticut, to work with educators across the Northeast to involve their students in We The People, a civics education program that culminates in a mock congressional hearing. When he received an email telling him that work will have to wind down, he said he was angry.",
      "\u201cThis strikes at the core of what education is all about,\u201d Grindrod said.",
      "Grindrod said the civics curriculum he worked on with teachers has been nonpartisan, with a focus on the history and framework of U.S. constitutional democracy. The training helped teachers engage students and apply civics education to real life, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is a curriculum that looks at all sides of an issue from the constitutional perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows students to develop critical thinking skills to look at all perspectives of an argument, to look at how some debates from the Federalists can still relate to today.\u201d",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The South Carolina Supreme Court has rejected what is likely the final appeal of condemned man Brad Sigmon, clearing the way for Friday's firing squad execution.",
      "Sigmon's lawyers wanted to delay his death so they could get a fuller hearing in court to learn more information about the drug South Carolina uses in lethal injections. Sigmon said that lack of information forced him to choose to be shot to death. The state also has an electric chair, but Sigmon said he didn't want to suffer being cooked alive by electricity.",
      "Sigmon's attorneys also argued that his lawyers in the original 2002 trial did a poor job of trying to save his life after he pleaded guilty by not submitting enough evidence of his mental problems.",
      "Sigmon, 67, beat his ex-girlfriend's parents to death with a baseball bat in their Greenville County home. His plan was to kidnap his ex-girlfriend, spend a romantic weekend together and then kill her and himself. She escaped from his car as he drove away.",
      "\"If I couldn\u2019t have her, I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody else have her. And I knew it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t have her,\u201d Sigmon said in a confession typed out by a detective after his arrest.",
      "Sigmon will be strapped into a chair at 6 p.m. Friday in the death chamber used for all South Carolina executions at Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. A target will be placed over his heart and a hood over his head. Three shooters, all with live ammunition, will fire from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away.",
      "Sigmon would be the first inmate killed by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years.",
      "Lawyers for Sigmon said in court papers that he chose a violent death by firing squad because, without more information, he thought he would die a tortuous death if he picked lethal injection.",
      "Autopsies from two inmates executed in the months since South Carolina changed its method of lethal injection to massive amounts of pentobarbital showed a considerable amount of fluid in their lungs. A defense expert testified the inmates could have suffered struggling to breathe.",
      "But lawyers for the state have said fluid is often found in the lungs of prisoners killed by lethal injections and other courts have not ruled it was cruel and unusual punishment. They also said witnesses at the executions, including the inmates' attorneys, did not report any breathing or signs of consciousness after about a minute.",
      "Prison officials also told the doctor conducting the autopsy that both Marion Bowman, who was executed on Jan. 31, and Richard Moore, executed on Nov. 1, needed twice the dose of the lethal injection drug typically used in other states and by the federal government.",
      "In Moore's case, two doses were given 11 minutes apart. In Bowman's execution, it wasn't clear the time range, although a witness heard talking 10 minutes after the execution began.",
      "\u201cThere is no justice here. Everything about this barbaric, state-sanctioned atrocity \u2014 from the choice to the method itself \u2014 is abjectly cruel. We should not just be horrified \u2014 we should be furious,\u201d defense attorney Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King said in a statement,",
      "South Carolina has a shield law that keeps the suppliers of its lethal injection drugs, the members of the execution team and the procedure used to kill an inmate secret, so it isn't known if South Carolina's new protocol requires two doses of pentobarbital.",
      "Sigmon also plans to ask Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to commute his death sentence to life in prison. His lawyers said he is a model prisoner trusted by guards and works every day to atone for the killings he committed after succumbing to severe mental illness.",
      "McMaster will make his decision moments before the execution starts. No South Carolina governor has granted clemency in the 49 years since the death penalty restarted."

      "Georgia U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath has filed paperwork to raise money for a run for governor in 2026, becoming the first Democrat to take that step",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath filed paperwork on Wednesday to raise money for a run for governor in 2026, becoming the first Democrat to take that step.",
      "McBath described her effort as an exploratory committee, although that could quickly become a full-blown campaign. The four-term member of Congress is best known as a gun control advocate.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is completing his second term and can't run again. On the Republican side, Attorney General Chris Carr is already running for governor in 2026 and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is widely expected to run.",
      "Other Democrats who have been exploring a run include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves and former DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Michael Thurmond. Democrat Stacey Abrams, who ran and lost to Kemp in 2018 and 2022, has not closed the door on a third run.",
      "McBath first won election to Congress in 2018, ousting Republican U.S. Rep Karen Handel to seize a seat in Atlanta's northern suburbs once held by Newt Gingrich. When Republicans redrew electoral districts after the 2020 Census, McBath jumped into a primary race against fellow Democrat Carolyn Bordeaux, beating her handily and winning election. Then after a court ordered another round of redistricting after finding African American votes were diluted, McBath shifted to a district Republicans drew on the western side of Atlanta.",
      "Those moves mean McBath has represented a much larger number of voters than the typical member of Congress, which could make her a stronger statewide candidate.",
      "McBath, like Abrams, would be bidding to become the first Black female governor of an American state. While that remains a difficult hurdle to cross, McBath is likely to have advantages as a Black woman in a Democratic primary in Georgia, where Black women are the backbone of the party.",
      "But McBath also tries to cultivate bipartisan appeal, especially with suburban swing voters. She was one of four Georgia Democrats earlier this year who voted for the Laken Riley Act, named for a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. illegally. The law was the first that President Donald Trump signed in his second term and makes it easier to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes.",
      "\u201cGeorgians deserve a Governor who understands what\u2019s at stake \u2014 because they\u2019ve lived it,\u201d McBath said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAs a mom and breast cancer survivor, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how regular people are too often left out of the political process. I look forward to continuing this conversation with my neighbors and fellow Georgians.\u201d",
      "The 64-year-old McBath rose to prominence as a gun control advocate after her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed in 2012 by a white man who was angry over the loud music the Black teenager and his friends were playing at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station. McBath, a former flight attendant, has had her political career heavily backed by billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.",
      "She touts her support of a 2022 law that toughens background checks for the youngest gun buyers, keeps firearms from more domestic violence offenders and helps states enact red flag laws making it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged dangerous.",
      "McBath led a group of survivors and family members of victims of gun violence who spoke in a prime-time slot at the 2024 Democratic National Convention."

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A suspected thief gulped down two pairs of diamond earrings during his arrest on the side of a Florida Panhandle highway last week, detectives say, leaving them with the unenviable task of waiting to \u201ccollect\u201d the Tiffany & Co. jewelry worth nearly $770,000.",
      "An X-ray of the suspect's torso showed what the Orlando Police Department believed to be the diamond earrings \u2014 a white mass shining brightly against the grey backdrop of his digestive tract.",
      "\u201cThese foreign objects are suspected to be the Tiffany & Co earrings taken in the robbery but will need to be collected ... after they are passed,\u201d the department's arrest report said. Handwriting on an order of commitment document filed Monday said \u201coutside medical,\u201d suggesting he was at a medical facility.",
      "The 32-year-old man from Texas is accused of forcibly stealing the earrings from an upscale Orlando shopping center last Wednesday.",
      "Orlando police spokeswoman Kaylee Bishop said Wednesday she was checking with the lead detective on whether the earrings had been recovered yet. The earrings\u2019 status also wasn\u2019t known to a deputy who answered the phone but wouldn\u2019t give his name in the rural Panhandle county where the suspect was arrested near Chipley, Florida.",
      "During the theft, the man allegedly told Tiffany sales associates he was interested in purchasing diamond earrings and a diamond ring on behalf of an Orlando Magic basketball player. Sales associates escorted the man to a VIP room where he could view the jewelry. A short time later, he jumped out of his chair, grabbed the jewelry and tried to force his way out of the door.",
      "One of the sales associates was injured trying to block him but managed to knock the diamond ring, valued at $587,000, out of his hands.",
      "Detectives obtained the license plate of the suspect\u2019s car through shopping mall security footage and believe he was driving back to Texas. State troopers tracked the car from tag readers on the Florida Turnpike and Interstate 10 until he was pulled over for driving without rear lights in Washington County, almost 340 miles (550 kilometers) away, the Orlando police report said.",
      "As he was being taken into custody, he swallowed several items troopers believed were the earrings.",
      "The suspect was charged with first-degree felony grand theft and robbery with a mask, a third-degree felony. Court records showed no attorney for him, and he was listed as being in police custody in Orange County Florida, which is home to Orlando, as of Wednesday morning.",

      "NEW YORK -- Lindsey Boylan helped drive Andrew Cuomo from office in 2021 when the former aide came forward as the first woman to accuse the governor of sexual harassment.",
      "At the time she had allies in high places: Every New York Democrat in Congress, the state's legislative leaders and then-President Joe Biden all condemned Cuomo's behavior and said he should resign.",
      "But now that Cuomo is back as a serious contender in the race to be mayor of New York City, many of those top Democrats have little to say about his candidacy.",
      "To Boylan, that feels like a betrayal \u2014 one that can't simply be explained away as an easing of #MeToo outrage.",
      "\u201cIf anything has changed, momentarily, it\u2019s that across our country, across issues, people who should be speaking up, aren\u2019t,\" Boylan, who served in the Cuomo administration for three years, said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anything has specifically changed with women being angry about how our rights are being taken away,\" she said. \"But the fact that most of our leaders are more interested in staying comfortable and staying in their jobs than actually protecting us and defending us. That\u2019s gotten much worse.\u201d",
      "Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report released by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed 11 women, including Boylan.",
      "Now, Cuomo is a frontrunner in the mayoral race, even as state and party leaders, while not warm to his candidacy, haven\u2019t condemned it either.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who as Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant governor had called his alleged behavior with women \u201crepulsive and unlawful,\u201d said Tuesday she stood by those comments. But, she added, she had to \u201cdeal in the reality today.\"",
      "\u201cI have to go forward in light of where we are today and deal with whatever the voters decide to deal with,\u201d she said, adding that she would work with Cuomo if he was elected.",
      "U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said on the NY1 television station that Cuomo made mistakes, but was also a talented executive who did good things as governor. It was up to New York City voters whether he deserved a second chance, she said, declining to give her own opinion on his candidacy.",
      "U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said last week that he would not endorse a candidate until after the city\u2019s June primary. The office of U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declined to comment.",
      "That Cuomo is a credible candidate is likely due to a mix of factors, experts said. These include the former governor's aggressive effort to discredit his accusers and his deep record of accomplishments as governor, as well as a field of mayoral candidates with little name recognition and an ongoing sense of disorder at City Hall.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, the incumbent, was indicted in September on federal corruption charges and is now dealing with a tempest of criticism after President Donald Trump\u2019s newly installed Justice Department leaders asked a court to drop the case so Adams could assist with the federal government\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "In a statement, a Cuomo spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, said multiple prosecutors have dug into the allegations the former governor sexually harassed women and none have sought to pursue the cases.",
      "\u201cThree years, five district attorney reviews that resulted in zero cases and civil cases that were either dropped or are dying on the vine,\u201d Azzopardi said, calling that \u201ca clarifying dose of due process.\u201d",
      "New York City \"is in crisis and everybody knows that Andrew Cuomo has the experience, the record and the skill to help save it,\" he added.",
      "Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said the current mayor's legal and political troubles help place Cuomo at the front of the pack of candidates.",
      "\u201cNew York is in such a state of chaos and the government needs someone to come in and take charge and run the show. He is well-matched for that moment,\" he said.",
      "Not to Boylan, though, who joined a demonstration outside a Cuomo campaign fundraising event on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHis path to victory is to destroy the women he abused,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything within my power and my sense of ethics to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "Boylan, who said she was subjected to an unwanted kiss and inappropriate comments from Cuomo, was disappointed but not surprised that other Democrats in New York had not spoken out more forcefully.",
      "\u201cThe most powerful people in New York politics are afraid of him,\" she said.",
      "Other female ex-aides described fielding kisses \u2014 sometimes on the lips \u2014 and sexually charged questions and remarks from him about their personal lives and appearance.",
      "A staffer at a state-related agency said he groped her rear while they posed for a photo. A state Health Department doctor was affronted by his comments, such as \u201cyou make that gown look good,\u201d while she gave him a COVID-19 test at a news conference. Another woman described Cuomo planting an unwanted kiss on her face when she met him at a wedding.",
      "One aide, Brittany Commisso, filed a criminal complaint accusing Cuomo of groping her breast while they were alone in an office at the governor's mansion, but a local district attorney declined to prosecute, citing lack of sufficient evidence.",
      "Cuomo apologized for having \u201coffended\u201d the women with remarks he said were intended to be collegial, and allowed that he sometimes had been \u201ctoo familiar\u201d with people. But he denied touching anyone inappropriately and said the investigation of his conduct was flawed and politically motivated.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, the Democrat who commissioned the sexual harassment investigation, herself briefly ran for governor in 2021 after Cuomo resigned, but dropped out after two months.",
      "Cuomo's lawyers and representatives have since fought to vindicate him amid multiple lawsuits from his accusers. Cuomo even has indicated he plans to file a defamation suit against one of the women, former aide Charlotte Bennett.",
      "Despite the accusations, Cuomo has lined up some endorsements from women in politics. City Council Member Kamillah Hanks, a Staten Island Democrat, said in her statement endorsing Cuomo that the \u201cunprecedented times\u201d called for a \u201cstrong, unapologetic\u201d leader.",
      "Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct and was found liable in 2023 by a New York City jury for sexual abuse, charges he denied, has also reshaped the idea of what is acceptable conduct for public officials, said Leigh Gilmore, a professor emeritus at Ohio State University and author of \u201cThe #MeToo Effect: What Happens When We Believe Women.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe political winds have shifted with Trump being in office, where it\u2019s not agreed anymore that those are disqualifying allegations,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A group backed by billionaire Elon Musk is behind a new set of deceptive attack ads and text messages targeting voters just weeks ahead of the election for a seat on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A group backed by billionaire Elon Musk is behind a set of deceptive attack ads and text messages targeting voters just weeks ahead of the election for a seat on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, employing a battleground state strategy it used last year against Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.",
      "The ads are labeled as coming from a group called Progress 2028 and are made to look like authentic messages of support for Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, who is backed by Democrats. They describe her as a \u201cprogressive champion\u201d who will \u201cstand up for immigrants,\u201d defend Planned Parenthood and promote a justice system that gives criminals \u201csecond chances.\u201d",
      "But records show the ads that appear on Facebook and Instagram and in text messages to some voters are underwritten by Building America\u2019s Future. That\u2019s a national conservative group that counts Musk among its biggest donors, a Wall Street Journal report revealed.",
      "The ads largely hew to the facts in Crawford\u2019s background but focus on hot-button issues such as abortion, immigration and criminal justice reform. They call for Crawford to \u201cboldly proclaim her progressive values,\u201d language that potentially diminishes her standing with moderate or conservative voters in a race that is \u2014 at least officially \u2014 nonpartisan.",
      "The new collection of ads is the latest example of how Musk\u2019s extraordinary wealth has been used to promote the Republican Party\u2019s political interests, including in a contest for ideological control of the highest court in one of the country\u2019s most important presidential swing states.",
      "The April 1 election will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. Looming are major cases dealing with abortion, union rights, election law and congressional redistricting \u2014 some that could influence the race for president in 2028.",
      "Musk\u2019s America PAC is the biggest outside spender in the supreme court race so far, doling out more than $3.2 million to benefit Crawford\u2019s Republican opponent, former Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, according to state records. Building America\u2019s Future has invested some $2 million in the race, records show.",
      "The world's richest man and top adviser to President Donald Trump also has sought to broaden his political influence. Federal Election Commission filings show Musk spent nearly $300 million supporting Republican campaigns last year. And in December, he threatened to fund congressional primary opponents for Republican federal lawmakers who stand in the administration\u2019s way.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Building America\u2019s Future has used this deceptive advertising tactic. Last September, the group registered in Virginia to use Progress 2028 as a fictitious name, Open Secrets revealed at the time. Progress 2028\u2019s website was created three days later.",
      "The following month, the group began running fake ads made to look as though they came from Democrats. They falsely claimed Harris supported policies such as eliminating gas-powered vehicles and giving voting rights to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Building America\u2019s Future also was the sole funder of a super PAC that last year ran contradictory ads in Michigan and Pennsylvania about Harris\u2019 stance on Israel. The ads characterized her position differently in targeted messages to Arab American and Jewish voters.",
      "Earlier this month, the group took down a social media ad in Wisconsin that featured the wrong Susan Crawford. The photo was of a Harvard professor rather than the state supreme court candidate.",
      "The Facebook and Instagram ads, first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, are targeted to specific users through the group\u2019s own custom lists, according to audience data in Meta\u2019s ad library.",
      "They describe Crawford as a \u201cprogressive champion\u201d and seemed to fool even some conservatives into thinking they were intended to promote her candidacy. Scott Manley, chief lobbyist for the state's chamber of commerce, which has endorsed Schimel, wrote on the social platform X, \u201cDid George Soros fund this ad?\" It was a reference to the billionaire philanthropist and liberal donor.",
      "Unlike Schimel, Crawford has never held elected office or run for office as a Democrat. Still, she has a long history of fighting for Democratic issues.",
      "That includes challenging the state's voter ID law passed by Republicans and representing Planned Parenthood in a case challenging a GOP law that required doctors performing abortions to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. She also represented teachers in a case attempting to overturn the law championed by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker that effectively ended collective bargaining rights for public workers.",
      "The ads hit at a particularly important time, with early voting starting in less than two weeks and Crawford still trying to introduce herself to voters. A Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday found that about 6 in 10 Wisconsin voters don\u2019t have an opinion about her.",
      "Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said he wasn't surprised that a Musk-backed group was \u201crunning fake and deceptive ads and lying to voters.\u201d He said Musk \u201ccharged into this race not knowing anything about it\u201d and poured millions into it \u201cbecause he knows Brad Schimel can be bought.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Building America\u2019s Future declined to comment.",
      "While no one has matched Musk's money, plenty of high-dollar donors also have supported Crawford in the race. She's benefiting from hefty donations from Soros; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat; Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. The liberal group A Better Wisconsin Together has spent some $2.3 million to benefit her campaign.",
      "While the new ads seem clever in their deception, they probably won't be effective in swaying many voters, said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted the messaging is mild compared to attack ads that are hitting Crawford more harshly.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018Progress 2028\u2019 ad has subtler messaging that requires the viewer to pay close attention to the content and connect the dots,\u201d Burden said. \u201cVoters who are aware enough to make these connections are probably already paying attention to the race and have enough independent information to offset any effect of the ads.\u201d",

(AP) \u2014 Five Democratic operatives in Connecticut's largest city made their first court appearances Thursday since being charged with tampering with absentee ballots in 2023, allegations that led to a court-ordered rerun of a mayoral primary and general election and fueled skepticism about U.S. election security.",
      "Three Bridgeport City Council members and the second in command of the city's Democratic Party organization were among the defendants who briefly appeared before a Bridgeport Superior Court judge, who set their next court dates for March 21. No one entered any pleas.",
      "In the runup to the 2023 primary, surveillance videos showed people on several occasions stuffing what appeared to be multiple absentee ballots into city collection boxes, police said. The defendants have also been accused of illegally helping voters fill out ballots and telling them who to vote for, according to arrest warrants.",
      "News of the surveillance videos helped fuel skepticism about the security of U.S. elections and was used to bolster false narratives about the 2020 presidential election being stolen,",
      "Among those arrested on Feb. 21 by state police were Wanda Geter-Pataky, vice chairperson of the Bridgeport Democratic Town Committee; City Council members Alfredo Castillo, Maria Pereira and Jazmarie Melendez; and Stratford resident Margaret Joyce, who told authorities she worked on Mayor Joe Ganim's campaign, according to arrest warrants.",
      "Castillo, Pereira and Melendez deny the allegations. Geter-Pataky and her lawyer declined to comment on the charges. Joyce declined to comment Thursday. Ganim has denied any knowledge of ballot tampering.",
      "Geter-Pataky and Castillo were supporters of Ganim, while Pereira and Melendez were for John Gomes, who challenged Ganim in the 2023 Democratic primary. Geter-Pataky and Castillo were previously charged with similar absentee ballot crimes connected to the 2019 election won by Ganim. State police allege Geter-Pataky is seen on the surveillance videos stuffing ballots into collection boxes.",
      "Ganim narrowly won the 2023 primary over Gomes and went on to win the general election. But both results were thrown out by a state judge because of evidence of alleged ballot tampering. Ganim won both do-over elections.",
      "Ganim was first elected mayor in 1991 and served 12 years before quitting when he was caught accepting bribes and kickbacks. Convicted of racketeering, extortion and other crimes, he spent seven years in prison but then won his old job back in 2015."

      "As toy inventors, toy manufacturers and buyers for stores that sell toys met for an annual trade show in New York last weekend, a topic besides which items were destined for holiday wish lists permeated the displays",
      "NEW YORK -- As toy inventors, toy manufacturers and buyers for stores that sell toys met for a four-day annual trade show in New York last weekend, a topic besides which items were destined for holiday wish lists permeated the displays.",
      "President Donald Trump had announced days before that he planned to increase the extra tariff he put on Chinese imports in February to 20%. Would he? By Tuesday, the last day of the Toy Fair, attendees had their answer, and the talk about how it would affect the prices of playthings grew more urgent.",
      "Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are sourced from China, according to The Toy Association, a national industry group that sponsors the show formerly known as the North American International Toy Fair. Many toy makers are now renegotiating prices with retailers and taking a hard look at their products to see if they can cut costs.",
      "Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, said price increases of 15% to 20% are expected on games, dolls, cars and other toys by the back-to-school shopping season. The price range that U.S. consumers are willing to pay is anywhere from $4.99 to $19.99, leaving little wiggle room to raise prices, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s untenable,\u201d Ahearn said, noting that small businesses make up roughly 96% of the American toy industry.",
      "Trump also moved forward this week with 25% tariffs on products imported from Canada and Mexico. Some companies have moved some of their manufacturing to Mexico to be closer to the U.S. On Wednesday, though, the president granted U.S. automakers a one-month exemption from the tariffs on the neighboring North American nations.",
      "Trump's changing statements and policies on tariffs have made it challenging for toy companies to plan accordingly.",
      "Basic Fun CEO Jay Foreman said he didn't rush late last year to get shipments of Tonka trucks, Care Bears and other toys his Boca Raton, Florida-based company produces in China because he wasn't sure if the 60% tariff on Chinese goods that Trump discussed on the campaign trail would come to pass.",
      "\u201cIf you plan in a chaotic environment, you have a much greater chance of being wrong than being right,\u201d Foreman said when interviewed Sunday at his Toy Fair booth. All of Basic Fun's toy products are made in China except for K'Nex, a construction set made in the U.S., he said.",
      "After Trump instead imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods last month, Foreman said he worked hard to persuade retailers to share some of the cost so he didn't have to pass it on to consumers. Now that the import duty has doubled, he said he will have to raise prices for many of his items.",
      "For example, a Tonka Classic Steel Mighty Dump Truck, which now retails for $29.99, will likely go up to $39.99 as early as the fall, Foreman said.",
      "The Toy Association lobbied hard to exempt the toy industry from the 10-25% tariffs Trump levied on Chinese goods during his first term. The group lobbied again this time around, trying to educate members of Congress that toy companies can't replicate the expertise found in Chinese factories.",
      "Ahearn noted there's a lot of sophistication of manufacturing and craftsmanship that has been built up over time over generations in China.",
      "he high skilled and lower cost labor force that is available in China is not available currently, and it will take this same amount of time to build that up (00:08:36)(9.8)",
      "Some toy companies are looking at ways to avoid raising prices.",
      "Steve Rad, CEO of toy maker Abacus Brands Inc., said the company based in Austin, Texas, considered switching to factories in countries like Cambodia or Vietnam, but concluded they don\u2019t have the same level of skills.",
      "However, Rad plans to start having one of its China-made products manufactured in the U.S. Abacus Brands found a Texas factory that said it could produce Pixicade, which converts doodles and drawings into playable video games, at no additional cost. The U.S.-made version is expected to be in stores by August, he said.",
      "His other toys are more complex, Rad said, and he doesn\u2019t see making them in the U.S. as feasible. Instead, he\u2019s exploring whether he can lower costs by cutting some product features.",
      "Foreman, of Basic Fun, said he plans to offer new spins on his existing toys to make them look new. Take Mash\u2019ems, which are soft, water-filled collectibles that feature different licensed characters packaged in small cardboard boxes.",
      "\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll change the color of the box,\u201d he said. \"Or maybe I\u2019ll put it in a plastic container.\u201d",
      "Some retailers already have received letters from toy suppliers announcing immediate price increases.",
      "Richard Derr is the owner of the Learning Express franchise in Lake Zurich, Illinois, and president of the 85-member Learning Express franchise council. He questions if those suppliers are acting in good faith since many of them had sped up deliveries from China ahead of the tariffs.",
      "He and other Learning Express franchisees are studying alternatives to suppliers that suddenly want to raise prices, Derr said.",
      "He said he isn't too worried about customers comparing what a toy costs compared with the year before since 65% of his products are new to the market.",
      "\u201cWe are in the era of one day, one thing, one day, two things, and it changes ups and down,\u201d Derr said. \u201cSo to put out something now, I think, is just preparing the stew when in fact the stew may not even be cooked.\""

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a fight over plans to store nuclear waste at sites in rural Texas and New Mexico",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a fight over plans to store nuclear waste at sites in rural Texas and New Mexico.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration and a private company with a license for the Texas facility appealed a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission exceeded its authority in granting the license. The outcome of the case will affect plans for a similar facility in New Mexico roughly 40 miles (65 kilometers) away.",
      "On this issue, President Donald Trump's administration is sticking with the views of its predecessor, even with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican ally of Trump, on the other side.",
      "The push for temporary storage sites is part of the complicated politics of the nation\u2019s so far futile quest for a permanent underground storage facility.",
      "Here's what to know about the case:",
      "Roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, is piling up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide and growing by more than 2,000 tons (1,800 metric tons) a year. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.",
      "A plan to build a national storage facility northwest of Las Vegas at Yucca Mountain has been mothballed because of staunch opposition from most Nevada residents and officials.",
      "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that the temporary storage sites are needed because existing nuclear plants are running out of room. The presence of the spent fuel also complicates plans to decommission some plants, the Justice Department said in court papers.",
      "The NRC granted the Texas license to Interim Storage Partners LLC for a facility that could take up to 5,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel rods from power plants and 231 million tons of other radioactive waste. The facility would be built next to an existing dump site in Andrews County for low-level waste such as protective clothing and other material that has been exposed to radioactivity. The Andrews County site is about 350 miles (560 kilometers) west of Dallas, near the Texas-New Mexico state line.",
      "The New Mexico facility would be in Lea County, in the southeastern part of the state near Carlsbad. The NRC gave a license for the site to Holtec International.",
      "The licenses would allow for 40 years of storage, although opponents contend the facilities would be open indefinitely because of the impasse over permanent storage.",
      "Republicans and Democrats, environmental groups and the oil and gas industry all oppose the temporary sites.",
      "Abbott is leading Texas' opposition to the storage facility. New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also is opposed to the facility planned for her state.",
      "A brief led by Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on behalf of several lawmakers calls the nuclear waste contemplated for the two facilities an \u201centicing target for terrorists\u201d and argues it's too risky to build the facility atop the Permian Basin, the giant oil and natural gas region that straddles Texas and New Mexico.",
      "Elected leaders of communities on the routes the spent fuel likely would take to New Mexico and Texas also are opposed.",
      "The justices will consider whether, as the NRC argues, the states forfeited their right to object to the licensing decisions because they declined to join in the commission\u2019s proceedings.",
      "Two other federal appeals courts, in Denver and Washington, that weighed the same issue ruled for the agency. Only the 5th Circuit allowed the cases to proceed.",
      "The second issue is whether federal law allows the commission to license temporary storage sites. Opponents are relying on a 2022 Supreme Court decision that held that Congress must act with specificity when it wants to give an agency the authority to regulate on an issue of major national significance. In ruling for Texas, the 5th Circuit agreed that what to do with the nation\u2019s nuclear waste is the sort of \u201cmajor question\u201d that Congress must speak to directly.",
      "But the Justice Department has argued that the commission has long-standing authority to deal with nuclear waste reaching back to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act.",

      "CASCADE LOCKS, Ore. -- Authorities planned to pull several vehicles from the Columbia River on Thursday, including a car believed to have belonged to a Portland couple who vanished in 1958 while out for a drive with their three daughters, including two whose bodies washed up at a dam the following year.",
      "The station wagon believed to belong to Ken and Barbara Martin was found last fall by Archer Mayo, a diver who had been looking for the car for seven years, said Mayo\u2019s representative, Ian Costello. Mayo pinpointed the likely location and dove several times before finding the car upside-down about 50 feet (15 meters) deep, covered in mud, salmon guts, silt and mussel shells, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is a very big development in a case that\u2019s been on the back of Portland\u2019s mind for 66 years,\u201d Costello told The Associated Press.",
      "The Martins took their three daughters on a car ride to the mountains in December 1958 to collect Christmas greenery, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported. They never returned. The bodies of two daughters were found the following year near the Bonneville Dam, but the rest of the family was never located.",
      "\u201cIt's been a high public interest case,\u201d Pete Hughes, a Hood River County sheriff\u2019s deputy, told the AP. After Mayo provided part of the license plate number and other vehicle identifiers, the sheriff's office and the Columbia Gorge major crimes team, along with the Oregon State Crime Lab, arranged to have the car pulled out, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're not 100% sure it's the car,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt's mostly encased in mud and debris, so we don't know what to expect when we pull it out of the water today.\u201d",
      "Mayo runs a business that finds things that were lost in the river, like watches and rings, but also helps with the recovery of drowning victims, Costello said. He had been looking for a research vessel that sank in 2017 when he learned about the Martin family, Costello said.",
      "Mayo began digging up material on the family and used modeling to pinpoint the possible location, he said. Mayo found other cars nearby, which will need to come out before the construction company pulls out the station wagon and authorities get answers to a 66-year-old mystery, Costello said.",
      "There is a road near where the cars were found underwater. Authorities haven't said whether they think they might find the remains of any other missing people in any of the other vehicles being pulled from the river."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump granted U.S. automakers a short reprieve from stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada this week",
      "DETROIT -- President Donald Trump's short reprieve for U.S. automakers from stiff tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada isn't likely to allow enough time for those companies to make the changes necessary to minimize the damage from Trump's intensifying trade war.",
      "Trump granted a one-month exemption to 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts traded through the North American trade agreement USMCA after speaking with leaders of automakers Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the White House said Wednesday. Trump then broadened the exemption beyond autos for Mexico on Thursday.",
      "In response to concerns about the short timeline for auto companies, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt noted that Trump told the companies to \u201cstart investing, start moving, shift production here.\u201d",
      "It's just not that simple.",
      "Automakers \u201cwill be hit differently based on exactly where their supply chain is,\u201d said John Paul MacDuffie, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania. In particular, \"GM and Ford have shrunk back from a formerly much more global footprint, but they still are global companies.",
      "\u201cOf course, if the goal is to move a lot of production to the U.S.,\u201d he added, \u201cI guess you could. But I don\u2019t see those changes happening quickly.\u201d",
      "Automakers responded to Wednesday's news graciously. Ford said in a company statement: \u201cWe will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the Administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\u201d Both GM and Stellantis thanked Trump for the exemption in statements.",
      "Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the three automakers, said he applauds the president \"for recognizing that vehicles and parts that meet the high U.S. and regional USMCA content requirements should be exempt from these tariffs.\u201d",
      "But with only a monthlong grace period, automakers know challenges lie ahead.",
      "To be sure, as automakers spent decades expanding around the world, they frequently battled supply-related woes and policy changes that hindered production \u2014 and their bottom lines.",
      "A disaster halfway across the globe impacting one tiny component, with no easy or obvious supply alternative, can take down a vehicle's production for weeks.",
      "Contentious labor negotiations and work stoppages have put significant pauses on automaking for the domestic car companies.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic also interrupted global supply chains and sent new and used vehicle inventory to disastrous lows on dealer lots, causing prices to skyrocket.",
      "\u201cAt least automakers have seen some version of this uncertainty,\u201d said Hovig Tchalian, assistant professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cI think this uncertainty is actually higher. But they\u2019ve had some practice doing it.\u201d",
      "Those disruptions and others throughout the business's history, however, have made it clear that automakers still can't respond very quickly.",
      "The tariff exemption is no exception, given the ever-increasing complexity of assembly lines and manufacturing. Plants can't be moved, factories can't be built and product lines can't be changed overnight.",
      "And even with this pause, steel and aluminum tariffs are still expected to go into effect on March 12. Then, on April 2, Trump is expected to set broad \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the taxes and subsidies charged by other countries on imports.",
      "Those would disrupt the automotive industry quickly and dramatically, said Sam Fiorani, an analyst at AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "\u201cA substantial change in automotive free trade will hurt stock prices of all automakers because their profits will take a hit and consumers will face higher prices on vehicles, further diluting sales going forward,\u201d he said.",
      "Not only do companies have to decide whether immediate changes in production are realistic, but if they\u2019re unable to do that meaningfully, they might produce or sell fewer vehicles \u2014 sending new car buyers to other brands or the used market \u2014 and, ultimately, make less money.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty that\u2019s being created for the auto industry is going to inhibit investment as firms try to assess what the future looks like,\u201d said Brett House, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school, \u201cand they have very little clarity on it.\u201d",

      "In June, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security said police arrested a suspect identified by U.S. law enforcement in a case involving a complicated web of money laundering and drug trafficking in China, Mexico and the U.S.. The suspect allegedly ran an auto sales business in the U.S. engaged in illicit foreign currency trading.",
      "In the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration found that fentanyl precursors and equipment to manufacture pills flowed from China to labs in Mexico, which made fentanyl powder and pills to be smuggled in. The DEA said drug money was laundered through Chinese underground banks.",

      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",

      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",

      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",

      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",

      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",

      "A Hong Kong newspaper was also on the list. While it was not named, the statement said that it was \"considered as being opposed to the PRC government\".",
      "Besides US agencies, hackers were said to have targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea and Indonesia.",
      "Last October, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said hacks targeting two major US presidential campaigns were carried out by \"actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China\".",
      "Earlier last year, seven Chinese nationals were charged with running a hacking operation that lasted at least 14 years and targeted foreign critics of China.",
      "Operations linked by Western governments to China have also targeted the UK's Electoral Commission, and the UK and New Zealand parliaments.",
      "As part of its long-running rewards programme, the US State Department said it was offering up to $10m for information on i-Soon, its employees and Chinese officials \"engaged in malicious cyber activities highlighted in the Department of Justice's indictments\"."

      "The CMA has concluded that, despite Microsoft investing billions of dollars into OpenAI and having exclusive uses of some of its AI products, the partnership remains the same, so is not subject to review under the UK's merger rules.",
      "Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been \"defanged.\"",
      "The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked.",

      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",

      "Tariffs, he says is a beautiful word, signalling jobs and riches for America.",
      "However, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.",
      "These extra taxes mean that Americans are facing the highest level of tariffs on goods being imported to their country since the 1930s.",
      "Vegetables from Mexico, wheat from Canada, toys and T-shirts from China are all in the firing line. Retailers of such items can have very narrow profit margins and will raise prices quickly to cover the tariffs.",
      "Consumers will notice the price rises.",
      "Groceries may be one of Trump's favourite words, but his own electorate may not appreciate the increase in bills they could face. Assuming no further tariffs, economists suggest US inflation, already higher than expected, could rise further in the second half of this year.",
      "A price worth paying \"to make America great again\"? Look no further than the laundry room for a cautionary tale.",
      "During his first-term of office in 2018, Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines after American producer Whirlpool complained about cheap South Korean competition.",
      "Those rivals - Samsung and LG - then set up in America, creating close to 2,000 jobs.",
      "But at what price? An imported washing machine cost an American shopper almost a third more at the start of 2023, just before tariffs were abolished, than five years previously.",
      "Add up the costs of tariffs and one study claims each of those jobs cost Americans the equivalent of more than $800,000 (\u00a3627,000).",
      "Those tariffs of course meant revenue for American governments and that source has increased dramatically in recent years, following the raft of tariffs Trump also imposed in his first term on China - most of which were retained under President Joe Biden.",
      "However, the amount netted is equivalent to a tax rise on American households of up to $300. Ultimately it is they who are footing the bill - and will continue to do so.",
      "Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Then consider the impact on American manufacturers who have businesses spanning Canada, Mexico and perhaps even China. Overall, economists think we could be looking at a hit to US growth of up to 1% - not enough to prompt a recession, but unwelcome nonetheless.",
      "In sheer numbers terms, the hit to the Canadian economy could be greater, economists say. It sells more than $400bn worth of goods to America every year, accounting for a fifth of its income.",
      "But it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.",
      "The damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.",
      "All of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.",
      "China, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere.",
      "Ironically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets.",
      "Countries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.",
      "A key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.",
      "If the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.",
      "As it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.",
      "And that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs.",
      "Weaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil."

      "In February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada.",
      "In the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.",
      "The moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.",
      "\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.",
      "His business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners.",
      "He presented the strategy to his board on Wednesday, ahead of the toy show, only to have to rip it up the next day, after Trump's later announcement.",
      "He will have to shoulder the tariff costs for products headed to stores this spring, he said, but is now expecting to raise prices for many items by at least 10% later in the year.",
      "\"The reality is that tariffs will raise the cost of toys for consumers,\" he said. \"If a customer says, 'Then I can't buy it', then I can't sell it, because I can't produce to lose money.\"",

      "Tariffs are a tax on imports collected by the government at the border and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.",
      "During Trump's first term, China was the main target of the measures, with more than $360bn worth of products sent to the US getting hit by the measures.",
      "At the time, toys and many other consumer products were spared.",
      "But Trump has now applied the duties across the board, hitting almost 15% of the imports into the US each year.",
      "His actions have been overshadowed by tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada - America's top two trade partners, which have long operated under a free trade agreement with the US.",
      "And they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year.",
      "But with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.",
      "The average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.",
      "\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.",
      "With manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.",
      "He said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.",
      "\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"",
      "Trump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas.",
      "But toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.",
      "Meanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis.",
      "Basic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment.",
      "\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Foreman said.",
      "The Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.",
      "President Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way.",
      "\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said.",
      "The Toy Fair is his organisation's marquee event, drawing businesses from around the world who line New York's convention center with cheerful displays of blocks, high-contrast baby books and spiky coloured balls. But worry about tariffs pulsed through the gathering this year.",
      "\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.",
      "From their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief.",
      "\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\""

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:03:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament.",
      "The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life.",
      "Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\"",
      "If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England.",
      "Currently, the situation on smacking children is different depending on where you are in the UK.",
      "In Scotland and Wales, corporal - or physical - punishment is illegal, but in England and Northern Ireland the \"reasonable punishment\" defence still stands.",
      "In England, the defence is included in the Children Act of 2004, but smacking children has been permitted by law since 1860.",
      "Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022.",
      "Prof Rowland said there were 67 countries around the world which had already adopted smacking bans, with a further 20 committing to do so.",
      "The government said it was \"looking closely\" at the changes made in Scotland and Wales, but had no plans to legislate on smacking at this stage.",
      "A spokesperson said the bill in its current form represented the \"single biggest piece of child protection legislation in a generation\".",
      "\"This government has prioritised significant reform of the children's social care system, driving better child protection and information sharing between education, health and social workers to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks,\" they added.",

      "Mum Leanne Casey, said parents \"should be able to discipline how they see fit\", but added: \"I don't agree with smacking children though, so if a ban is what it takes then I'd agree that is what you need to do.\"",
      "Dad Oli Harrison said he would \"never intervene\" in another person's parenting methods, but added that a ban would \"probably be beneficial\" to avoid it being seen as a \"grey area\".",
      "When looking at populations as a whole, Prof Rowland said physical punishment \"undoubtedly harms children's health\".",

      "Her father, who had fled to Pakistan after the murder, had phoned police in England claiming he had \"legally punished\" Sara before her death.",

      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",

      "\"All three groups, who face barriers to their learning, unlocked significant benefits in English literacy.\"",

      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",

      "The Brit Awards ceremony last weekend prompted 825 complaints to media watchdog Ofcom, with the majority involving Sabrina Carpenter's pre-watershed opening performance and Charli XCX's outfit.",
      "US star Carpenter opened the awards show at The O2 in London on Saturday evening with a mash-up of her hits Espresso, Bed Chem with Rule Britannia!, while wearing a red sparkly military-style mini-dress with matching stockings and suspenders.",
      "She was also seen having a close encounter with a dancer dressed as a soldier wearing a bearskin hat during the show, broadcast live on ITV.",
      "Essex star Charli XCX, who won five awards, wore a see-through black dress and addressed the controversy over her outfit during one of her speeches on the night: \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples. I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the complaints against our rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.\"",
      "These complaints numbers are not huge by Ofcom's standards.",
      "The most complaints the watchdog has received was 58,000 in 2021, about Piers Morgan's criticism of the Duchess of Sussex on Good Morning Britain. Ofcom found ITV was not in breach of broadcasting rules.",
      "An episode of Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 4 got 45,159 complaints in 2007 and the same show, but this time on Channel 5, got 25,327 complaints in 2018.",

      "Charli XCX won album of the year for her summer hit Brat. She also picked up best dance act, song of the year for her track Guess, featuring Billie Eilish (who was the first non-Brit to appear on a best song-winner), plus songwriter of the year.",
      "Carpenter was honoured with the recently resurrected global success award.",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether, but it may have been brought back to lure Carpenter to perform.",
      "This isn't the first time the Brit Awards have prompted complaints.",
      "In 2020, Ofcom received 309 complaints that rapper Dave's performance at the awards was racist against white people, but this was rejected by the media watchdog. Dave had performed the song Black, but Ofcom said it was \"likely to be within most viewers' expectations of this well-established awards ceremony\".Ofcom received 74 complaints in 2018 about Kendrick Lamar's performance at that year's ceremony - he was muted 10 times while performing Feel and New Freezer. His set also included a man taking a baseball bat to the windshield of an expensive-looking sports car.

      "It became the bestselling adult debut hardback of 2024, according to The Bookseller.",

      "An accomplished live performer, her 2024 Guts tour banked $186m (\u00a3144m) in ticket sales; and she will also headline the BST festival in London's Hyde Park two days before Glastonbury.",

      "Influential soul, jazz and funk producer and composer Roy Ayers has died at the age of 84.",
      "In a statement posted on Facebook, his family said: \"It is with great sadness that the family of legendary vibraphonist, composer, and producer Roy Ayers announce his passing which occurred on March 4 2025 in New York City after a long illness.\"",
      "They described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"",
      "Ayers' own biggest hit was the mellow track Everybody Loves the Sunshine, which was covered by artists like d'Angelo and sampled by others including Mary J Blige and Tyler, the Creator.",
      "But he was so much more than his best-known record. A pioneer of nu-soul and jazz funk, he was a key figure in the 90s acid jazz movement.",
      "Happy and Blurred Lines singer Pharrell Williams has described him as one of his greatest musical inspirations.",
      "Ayers had a huge influence on many RnB and hip-hop stars, particularly in the 90s, with artists like Tribe Called Quest, Mary J Blige and Jill Scott sampling his earlier work on tracks like Bonita Applebaum, My Life and Watching Me.",
      "He also worked with Guru and The Roots. Erykah Badu called him \"the king of neo soul\".",
      "More recently, Calvin Harris told BBC Radio 2 that Ayers \"just stood out, his music is amazing and just so intricate... everything just sounds so rich and warm\".",
      "Ayers performed at Glastonbury several times; his last performance there was in 2019.",
      "He also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy starring Pam Grier.",
      "Ayers could play several instruments, including the flute and trumpet but he became synonymous with the vibraphone, a percussion instrument that looks similar to a xylophone but has a set of metal bars rather than wood.",
      "His other hits include Running Away and Searchin', with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity, who were also behind Everybody Loves the Sunshine.",
      "Musical family",
      "Roy Edward Ayers Jr was born into a musical family in Los Angeles on 10 September 1940.",
      "His mum Ruby was a school teacher and piano teacher, while his dad, Roy Sr, was a parking attendant and trombonist.",
      "Ayers began playing the piano at the age of five and went on to play several instruments and sing in the church choir before plumping for the vibraphone.",
      "Jazz star Lionel Hampton may have had something to do with that. Ayers attended a Lionel Hampton Big Band concert when he was just five. Quite taken by Ayers's enthusiasm and delight at the performance, Hampton gifted the youngster a pair of vibe mallets.",
      "Ayers formed his first group while at Jefferson High School, aptly named the Jefferson Combo, and later studied advanced music theory at college.",
      "He became a professional musician in 1961.",
      "He went on to record three albums with jazz flautist Herbie Mann before forming Roy Ayers Ubiquity and landing the hit Everybody Loves the Sunshine in 1976, from the album of the same name.",
      "His last solo album, Mahogany Vibes, featuring Badu, came out in 2004.",
      "Ayers is survived by his wife Argerie, and their children Mtume and Ayana Ayers.",
      "The Facebook post on Ayers's page added: \"His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming.\""

    "story": [
      "A police force \"acted reasonably\" during a hate crime investigation into a social media post by the Daily Telegraph journalist Allison Pearson, a report states.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) looked into Essex Police's actions after Pearson claimed she felt \"bullied and threatened\" when officers visited the columnist's home on Remembrance Sunday in November 2024.",
      "The force has previously defended its since-dropped investigation over an allegation that a social media post, about the Hamas-Israel conflict, incited racial hatred.",
      "Responding on X, Ms Pearson accused Essex Police of \"marking their own homework in my case which was widely viewed as utterly outrageous\".",
      "In his findings, Mark Hobrough, the NPCC's hate crime lead and chief constable of Gwent, said footage from a body-worn camera showed the investigating officer's approach to Pearson was \"polite and carried out in an exemplary manner\".",
      "The original investigation was sparked by a complaint by a member of the public that a social media post in the early weeks of the Middle East conflict contained critical remarks about the police.",
      "\"The posted image was likely to mislead the reader into thinking this was from a pro-Palestine rally, whether intended to do so, or unintentionally so,\" the report said.",
      "'How dare they?'",
      "The report redacts details of the now-deleted post, from 16 November 2023, which the BBC has seen.",
      "It shows an image of two police officers standing next to two men holding what appears to be a flag of the Pakistani political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).",

      "It added: \"Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.\"",
      "X added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it was \"not related to Palestine\".",
      "The report, which redacts Pearson's name, stated an officer went to her home and on his recording of the discussion \"clearly states he is there to try to arrange a voluntary attendance interview, to assist the investigation into a complaint of inciting racial hatred\".",
      "Pearson \"began to challenge the officer's actions\", the report adds.",
      "\"She implied that a complaint would be made to the Chief Constable by the Telegraph newspaper.\"",
      "The timing of the visit, early on a Sunday morning, could be judged inconsiderate, but the officer had already made a previous, unanswered visit and was \"diligently trying to conduct his workload\", the report added.",
      "\"Our view is that the officer's behaviour during this interaction was exemplary,\" the report adds.",
      "\"He did not become defensive or challenging and remained calm and polite throughout the interaction.\"",
      "The home visit was reported in the media, the report adds, with much of the reporting referring to as a \"non-crime hate incident\", \"despite a clear explanation [from the officer] that he was investigating an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online.\"",
      "The report praised Essex Police for the way it supported officers and its \"valiant attempt to maintain public confidence\" with its own media releases.",
      "'Totally outrageous'",
      "Pearson did not attend the voluntary police interview and the case was closed when the CPS concluded there was not a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence of stirring up racial hatred under the Public Order Act or the Communications Act.",
      "The report noted that the force, on reviewing the CPS decision, concluded that no crime had been committed.",
      "\"We do not take the view that a crime did not take place,\" the report states, \"rather that there was no realistic prospect of conviction based on the evidence available.\"",
      "The NPCC found Essex Police \"acted reasonably\" in its handling of the complaint but the force should have had a \"more active approach\" in categorising the crime, to avoid ambiguity.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme soon after the case was discontinued, Pearson said she did not think her tweet was wrong, and added: \"I won't censor myself but I will be more watchful in the future.\"",
      "The police visit to her home was not \"standard practice\" and was \"absolutely unacceptable\", she claimed.",
      "She added: \"Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader and many other people in the law, in politics, in normal walks of life, have said that is totally outrageous.\"",
      "Posting the BBC's story on X on Thursday, she said: \"Here are the police marking their own homework in my case which was widely viewed as utterly outrageous.",
      "\"And was rejected instantly by the CPS.",
      "\"A clear breach of my right to freedom of expression.\"",
      "'High bar'",
      "Responding to the report, an Essex Police spokesman said: \"In November last year we launched an investigation into an alleged offence of inciting racial hatred relating to a social media post.",

      "\"We 're sometimes faced with allegations of crime where people have strong opposing views and that is why it is essential for us to remain impartial.\"",

      "Ms Pavlovich first made her allegations public in a Tortoise Media podcast in summer 2024, and was also one of eight women who made claims of assault, abuse and coercion to New York Magazine in January.",
      "In response to that article, Gaiman said: \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"",
      "A spokesman for Palmer has said: \"While Ms Palmer is profoundly disturbed by the allegations that Mr Gaiman has abused several women, at this time her primary concern is, and must remain, the wellbeing of her son and therefore, to guard his privacy, she has no comment on these allegations.\"",
      "Ms Pavlovich filed a lawsuit against Gaimain and Palmer in Wisconsin, and against Palmer in Massachusetts and New York.",

    "summary": "The Hollywood actor has helped 900 people in south Wales with their debts for a new documentary.",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has written off \u00a31m-worth of people's debts, using \u00a3100,000 of his own money.",
      "Sheen started a debt acquisition company to help 900 people in south Wales.",
      "It has been documented in a new Channel 4 show called Michael Sheen's Secret Million Pound Giveaway, due to air next week - five months after the closure of Port Talbot's last blast furnace, which marked the end of traditional steelmaking in south Wales.",
      "The show aims to reveal how some banks and finance companies profit from society's most vulnerable.",
      "Sheen said he did not have \u00a3100,000 to \"throw around\" and therefore wanted the project to be \"effective\".",
      "Despite initial doubts, an encounter with a woman in a Port Talbot cafe who shared the story of \"steelworkers in tears\" losing their jobs, convinced him to keep going.",
      "Sheen to fund new national theatre for Wales",
      "Final curtain goes down on National Theatre Wales",
      "It comes two months after Sheen announced he was funding a new theatre company to fill the gap left by the folding of National Theatre Wales.",
      "In 2021, Sheen declared himself a \"not-for-profit\" actor, pledging to use all the money he earns for good causes.",
      "The 56-year-old, who has starred in films such as Frost/Nixon and The Damned United, also sold his houses to make sure the 2019 Homeless World Cup went ahead in Cardiff.",
      "Appearing on the One Show on Tuesday, the actor explained how exactly the system of debts work.",
      "It sees people's debts get put into a bundle, with a debt-buying company then able to buy those bundles at a lower price.",
      "Despite the money being owed by people remaining the same, the companies that own the debt can then sell them for less and less money.",
      "Sheen said he was able to set up a debt acquisition company with \u00a3100,000 of his own money to buy \u00a31m worth of debt because it had come down in value.",
      "Although the system was \"bizarre\" and he initially had \"no idea\" how it worked, Sheen said \"it seemed like a good thing to do\".",
      "The company was not set up in Sheen's name and he had to be at \"arm's length from it\".",
      "He did not know the identity of people's debts he paid off, he only knew where they lived and the kind of debt it was.",
      "Sheen added: \"I would never know who they are - I still don't know who they are.\"",
      "During the making of the documentary, the process became far more complicated than he anticipated.",
      "\"I thought I would only work on this for a few weeks or a month or something, and it turned into two years, because we had to do it secretly,\" he said.",
      "Sheen added that setting up the company took so long that at a one point he felt like he wasn't going to be able to keep doing it.",
      "His mindset changed after filming in a cafe in his hometown of Port Talbot as the local steelworks prepared to close.",
      "\"The woman who worked at the cafe we were filming in told me the story of the men sitting on every table in tears, who were losing their jobs,\" he said.",
      "\"And I just thought - then, it really hits home, I just thought anything I can do [to help]\".",
      "The hour-long documentary will air on Channel 4 on Monday 10 March - five months after the last remaining blast furnace was closed in Port Talbot - which brought an end to the traditional method of steelmaking in south Wales.",
      "As a result, Tata Steel announced that 2,800 jobs were going to be cut which created uncertainty and stress for many families.",
      "Currently, Sheen confirmed that he has helped 900 people with their debts across south Wales.",
      "He added that due to the \"stigma\" around discussing money, some people might not even realise their debts have been paid off, and therefore he urged people to check their accounts.",

      "\"And I really hope that tonight in this ceremony and this amazing honour is the first step of me, and on behalf of my family, reconnecting to this beautiful country.\"",
      "Eisenberg was inspired to make A Real Pain after the death of his great aunt Doris at the age of 106 in 2019. She grew up in Poland but fled to the US in 1938. Other family members who remained in Poland were killed during the Holocaust.",
      "President Duda said: \"I am delighted that people from across the ocean acknowledge their heritage, recognise that their ancestors hail from the Republic [of Poland] and seek to forge a connection with our country.\"",

      "Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.",
      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",
      "What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.",
      "\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.",
      "She makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.",
      "There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt.",
      "\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"",

      "Meghan Netflix show delayed over LA wildfires",
      "Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.",
      "It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.",
      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",
      "Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.",
      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",
      "She's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"",
      "As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.",
      "In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".",
      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",

      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",

      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",

      "Asked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.",

      "But was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",

      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",

      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",

      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",

      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

    "summary": "The cheap painkiller seems to help the immune system detect and destroy cancers.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists believe they have discovered how the cheap painkiller aspirin can stop cancers spreading.",
      "In animal experiments they showed the drug enhanced the ability of the immune system to fight back.",
      "The team at the University of Cambridge said it was an exciting and surprise discovery that could eventually lead to cancer patients being prescribed the drug - but not yet and people are advised against just taking the pills themselves.",
      "Regular aspirin comes with risks and trials are still trying to figure out which patients are most likely to benefit.",
      "Tantalising data from more than a decade ago showed people who were already taking a daily aspirin were more likely to survive if they were diagnosed with cancer.",
      "But how?",
      "It appears to centre on a moment of vulnerability for a cancer - when a lone cell breaks off from the original tumour and tries, like a seed on the wind, to spread elsewhere in the body.",
      "This process is called metastasis and is the cause of the majority of deaths from cancer.",
      "Part of our immune defences - a white blood cell called a T-cell - can swoop in and destroy the spreading cancer as it tries to take root.",
      "But the study showed that another part of our blood - the platelets that normally stop bleeding - were suppressing the T-cells and making it harder for them to take out the cancer.",
      "Aspirin disrupts the platelets and removes their influence over the T-cells so they can hunt out the cancer.",
      "Prof Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, told me: \"What we've discovered is that aspirin might work, surprisingly, by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and kill metastasizing cancer cells.\"",
      "He thinks the drug would work best in cancers that have been caught early and could be used after treatment such as surgery to help the immune system find any cancer that might already have spread.",
      "Should I take aspirin for cancer?",
      "The most natural question for anybody with cancer to ask is should they be taking aspirin.",
      "\"If you are a cancer patient, don't rush to your local pharmacy to buy aspirin just yet, but actively consider participation in ongoing or upcoming trials of aspirin,\" says Prof Mangesh Thorat, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "He says the study provided \"the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle\" in understanding how aspirin works, but there were still questions to answer.",
      "Aspirin can cause dangerous internal bleeding including strokes so the risks have to be balanced. It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.",
      "Some patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin.",
      "But it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too.",
      "These are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back.",
      "She said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\".",
      "However, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\".",
      "In the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.",
      "'Eureka moment'",
      "The discovery, published in the journal Nature, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.",
      "The team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.",
      "They were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.",
      "Further investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body.",
      "Dr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: \"It was a Eureka moment.",

    "summary": "\u201cKasibba\u201d, who is non-verbal and had no family to speak for her, was one of hundreds wrongly detained.",
    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries.",
      "Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.",
      "However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a \"profound tragedy\".",
      "By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.",
      "The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.",
      "If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.",
      "In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.",
      "However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.",
      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",

      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",

      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",

      "The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution.",
      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",

      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",
      "\"I was able to start my own life, and I went to university. I've got my own house and my daughter had the best start in life.\"",
      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",
      "\"My dad noticed something wasn't right straight away,\" Lewis recalls.",
      "As a child, he endured disruptive hospital stays, including an unsuccessful attempt to graft a toe on to his hand to create a functioning finger.",
      "\"I've had extensive surgery, but there are limits to what can be done.\"",

      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",

      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",

      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

      "Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with England's GPs, the government has said.",
      "The deal gives an extra \u00a3889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients.",
      "The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.",
      "However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament.",
      "GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.",
      "Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.",
      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",
      "More money to cover rising costs",
      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",
      "The total figure includes almost \u00a3800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients.",
      "Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.",
      "GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\".",
      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",
      "\"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.",
      "\"This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra \u00a3889m next year.",
      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",

      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",

She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",
      "\"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week.",

Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly.  She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe.",
      "At one stage, she says she obtained the drug from another patient, who had a surplus, against regulations via Instagram. She describes her situation as \"constantly stressful\".",
      "Leading pancreatic clinicians and charities including Pancreatic Cancer UK have written to the prime minister saying the absence of Pert can have a \"devastating impact on people's lives\", with doctors and pharmacists \"inundated with requests for help from desparate patients\".",
      "The letter says that without the drug, people experience \"horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life\".",
      "There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".  They say that with creon running short, switching by patients has depleted stocks of the alternatives. They are calling for a national process for importing Pert.",
      "Worry and stress",
      "The Cystic Fibrosis Trust says the shortages have caused \"significant worry and stress for those affected\".",
      "The charity has told patients that a \"shortage of raw ingredients is straining the manufacturing process and disrupting global supply chains\".",
      "Production of creon is said to rely heavily on pancreatic enzymes sourced from pigs.  The Royal Pharmaceutical Society meanwhile is calling on the government to adopt a national strategy to manage medicine shortages.",
      "There have been wider problems with drug shortages. The National Pharmacy Association, representing community chemists in the UK, sought views on the issue.",
      "Of the 500 which responded, all said they were unable to dispense a prescription at least once a day because of supply problems, and a large majority said patients came in at least once a day to get medicines they had failed to get elsewhere.",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We know how frustrating and distressing medicine supply issues can be for patients, and the pharmacists and clinicians caring for them.",

      "He said Scotland would \"benefit most of all\" from scrapping green targets, which he claimed were \"so destructive to jobs and skills\".",

      "He said he was \"very proud\" of the councillors who are joining the party from \"the now frankly irrelevant Conservative party\".",

      "Five former Scottish Conservative councillors have already defected to Reform - one in Glasgow,  two in Aberdeenshire and two in North Ayrshire.",
      "Tice, the MP for Boston and Skegness, said: \"We're going up in the polls, I think you're going to see us by the summer around 20%.\"",
      "He also claimed that Reform \"almost\" have more members in Scotland than the Labour Party. In 2021, Labour had about 16,000 members in Scotland. Reform says their current membership in Scotland is about 9,300.",
      "Tice said: \"I think that's the reason why John Swinney and the Labour Party, Anas Sarwar, are terrified.\"",
      "Tice added they intend to field candidates in every seat during next year's Scottish parliament elections, campaigning with Scotland specific policies, in an attempt to secure the party's first seat in Holyrood.",

      "Ministers are streamlining local government by merging councils and setting up single authorities that provide all the services in their areas.",
      "But a survey by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU) think tank suggested there was low support for it among council leaders, with less than a quarter of those who responded believing the changes would ease their financial challenges.",
      "A government spokesperson said reorganisation was \"a tough choice\" but \"the right one\" to improve the sustainability and resilience of local authorities.",
      "Councils have been under financial pressure for some time.",

      "Only 23% of those surveyed agreed with the statement that the reorganisation would alleviate the financial challenges facing councils.",
      "The survey received responses from 150 councils out of 317 in England.",
      "The think tank's chief executive, Jonathan Carr-West, said:  \"On the one hand, the government has had some success in resetting the central-local relationship and there is near consensus that the promised multi-year settlements will benefit council finances.",
      "\"Conversely, many councils are anticipating that reorganisation and the increase in National Insurance Contributions will heap added pressure onto already overextended council budgets.\"",
      "The LGIU said the problems were not \"insurmountable\", calling for councils to be more involved and more \"manageable\" timescales.",
      "The restructuring of local councils started in some places under the last Conservative government, with Labour planning to extend it across all of England.",
      "It would mean areas with two-tiers of councils, both county and district, would be replaced with single \"unitary\" councils that provide all services, with more regional mayors.",
      "Last month the government agreed to delay local elections that were due to take place in May in nine council areas to allow them to reorganise.",
      "For some, it's a welcome move that will make help councils deliver services more effectively.",
      "Tim Oliver, chairman of County Councils Network, which represents larger local authorities in England, said: \"Financial pressures, coupled with the structural weaknesses and the public's confusion of the multi-tier system, means that it has become impossible to justify.",
      "\"The government's timelines for proposals for change are ambitious, but county councils and their partners are working hard to match these and deliver forward-looking proposals for new unitary councils.\"",
      "Others \u2013 including the District Councils' Network, which represents smaller authorities \u2013 have warned it would create a period of \"turmoil\".",
      "While there's some disagreement about the government's plans to reshape local councils, many across the sector say the bigger challenge is addressing the underlying financial pressures they face.",
      "For the financial year from April, 30 councils have been given \"exceptional financial support\" to help them balance the books, with many councils planning on increasing council tax and cutting services.",
      "A government spokesperson said it is making \u00a369bn of funding available to councils across England - which includes council tax rises.",
      "\"This government inherited a crumbling local government sector,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"We are prepared to take tough choices necessary to rebuild local government and give taxpayers the services they deserve.\"",

      "The same proportion believe DWP does not provide enough support to those out of work because of disability, ill health or a long-term health condition, according to the survey.",
      "Some 5,002 people were polled by Ipsos in October, including 1,705 who described themselves as having a long-term health condition or disability that affected their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. The DWP said the data would soon be published in full."

    "story": [
      "There is one phrase, one slogan, one promise which is associated with former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak more than any other.",
      "It is \"Stop the Boats\".",
      "Yet, in his first wide-ranging interview since leaving Downing Street, the former prime minister says he regrets ever saying it because it was \"too stark..too binary\".",
      "And he concedes that it couldn't actually be delivered.",
      "This is just one of the \"lessons from Downing Street\" which the man who presided over the worst ever election defeat for the Conservative Party says he's learned, in a conversation lasting more than two hours for my Political Thinking podcast.",
      "It covers not only the mistakes he thinks he made, but also the disagreements about the right way to manage the economy that he had with Boris Johnson; the radical ideas he wishes he could've implemented; the lessons he learned from being chancellor during the Covid pandemic - and his attitudes to race and faith and Englishness as the first British Asian prime minister.",
      "Sunak is in reflective mood talking about a job he was catapulted into, saying he didn't \"probably have the time to enjoy it in the moment or appreciate it in the moment because of the context in which I was doing it.\"",
      "That context was not just an economic crisis but a political one.",
      "The Tories were on their third leader in just 50 days, and there'd been no election of party members or the wider public.",
      "\"I didn't have a mandate,\" he says, and defends his approach of trying to bring warring factions together.",
      "To do otherwise, he says, \"would have been a huge gamble because the thing just could have collapsed. And would that have been good for the country? I don't think so. I think what the country needed was stability.\"",
      "He's not changed his mind about wanting to deport migrants who cross the channel to Rwanda, and says he now backs leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), if it's not reformed.",
      "He says the court has \"taken on new powers. There's been mission creep...It does need to reform or we should leave.\"",
      "When I asked him if he had taken his eye off the ball in regards to soaring levels of net migration, he concedes that although he \"took very strong action to bring the levels of legal migration down\u2026I should have done them sooner\".",
      "Stopping small boats is a priority for people - Sunak",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Sunak was in many ways an accidental prime minister. It was October 2022, and he learned that Liz Truss had survived in the job for less time than that famous lettuce, whilst having a meal with his two daughters at TGI's in Teesside after a game of bowling.",
      "Four days later, he walked into Number 10 as her successor.",
      "He says he \"had very mixed feelings\u2026given what had happened\" but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves \"doing your duty\".",
      "\"You've just got to focus on doing your best, doing what you're there to do, and not worry about the rest,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a very helpful concept for me\u2026I kept coming back to that. I said, 'look, this is my job. This is what I'm here to do. I'm well-placed to try and solve the economic challenge that our country is facing'.\"",
      "Bringing the economy back under control after the markets panicked in the face of Truss's unfunded tax cuts \u2013 or what he calls \"fantasy economics\" - is the achievement he's clearly proudest of.",
      "However, he spells out for the first time the scale of the disagreements he had not just with Truss, but with Boris Johnson, who he served as Chancellor.",
      "\"He and I had quite different views on economic policy. I'm a small state conservative. I believe in prioritising, trying to restrain the growth of public spending, being careful with our borrowing so that we can cut people's taxes...he was less worried about those things.\"",
      "He tells me that at their regular Sunday night dinners in Downing Street they argued over what could and could not be afforded.",
      "He says his worries were inflation and interest rates rising, because \"when they go up it's going to have a big impact on our public finances, because we're going to have to pay more to service the debt that we've got\".",
      "He adds: \"We cannot afford to keep spending and borrowing at this rate, and that means you have to prioritise. We can't do everything.\"",
      "Sunak insisted that any plan to subsidise people's social care costs had to be paid for by higher taxes.",
      "Now he thinks \"we're having another review now...I tell you, the answer is, do we as a country think it's right to pay more taxes for a more generous social care policy? Yes or no? I personally think the answer is no.\"",
      "He believed in slashing billions from welfare bills, a more \"radical restructuring of the state\" to pay for increased defence spending, and he says he told Johnson that the UK's net zero obligations were saddling the economy with cost.",
      "Now he argues for abandoning the legal commitment to deliver net zero, made law by another Tory leader Theresa May.",
      "During the Covid pandemic both Sunak and Johnson faced fixed term penalties for breaking lockdown rules.",
      "Sunak tells me he thought long and hard about resigning after that but says he had a job to do and he clearly can still scarcely believe that he was fined for turning up at a work meeting early where a cake was produced for the prime minister's birthday.",
      "Much more interesting is the lesson he draws from that period.",
      "We should all have been treated more like grown-ups, he tells me, and the public should have told that \"even the scientists themselves are not united on this, or they don't 100% know that this is the right thing to do\".",
      "The long-term negative consequences of lockdown measures should have been spelt out because, he says, \"we've seen the impact it's had on school kids everywhere and the impact it's had on their learning. And we probably didn't talk about that as much as we could have done at the time.\"",
      "Sunak is proud to have been the first British Asian prime minister and talks movingly of the moment his grandfather \u2013 who'd been born poor in an Indian village \u2013 calling an old friend at home with tears in his eyes on his first visit to Westminster.",
      "He's angry too with those like a popular podcaster who declared recently: \"He's a brown Hindu; how is he English.\"",
      "\"Of course I'm English, born here, brought up here,\" he says.",
      "\"On this definition, you can't be English even playing for England, let alone supporting them... I genuinely thought it was ridiculous.\"",
      "Here is a man proud of his roots and ready to admit mistakes, but who is wondering whether his rise to the top all happened before the country knew him, and could see beyond the super-wealthy Tory who was the fifth Tory leader in just six years.",
      "\"It's a lonely job,\" he says, \"because it is 100% only on you.\"",
      "Many were sure that he'd called the election early to head off to a new life in California.",
      "Nonsense, he says, he lives here because it's home and indeed has just set up a charitable foundation \u2013 the Richmond Project \u2013 named after the constituency in Yorkshire, which he's still proud to represent in Parliament.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:07:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The announcement of new support for courts comes as two reports warn the justice system is struggling.",
    "story": [
      "Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.",
      "The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.",
      "The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.",
      "There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.",
      "Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.",
      "The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.",
      "Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.",
      "She said a cap on sitting days had a \"drastic effect\", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.",
      "A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was \"unprecedented\", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.",
      "\"The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,\" she told the Today programme.",
      "\"We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,\" she added.",
      "But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt \"out of reach\" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.",
      "One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.",
      "Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under \"immense pressure\" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.",
      "\"With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,\" she said.",
      "\"I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first.\"",
      "Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had \"accepted\" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.",
      "The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.",
      "Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: \"Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned.\"",
      "Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.",
      "\"We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years.\"",
      "Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of \"queues for justice\" were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that the state of courtrooms were in \"a pretty dire way\", and funding was also needed for upkeep.",
      "\"There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,\" she said."

      "The UK government has said it will not send further payments to Rwanda following the cancellation of the migrant deal between the two countries.",
      "On Monday, Rwanda's government spokesperson Yolande Makolo said the UK had asked Rwanda to \"quietly forgo\" the remaining payment - reportedly amounting to \u00a350m ($64m) - based on \"trust and good faith\".",

      "In a statement, a UK government spokesperson said that \"no further payments in relation to this policy will be made and Rwanda has waived any additional payments\".",
      "The row over payments linked to the Rwanda scheme comes after the UK government announced it would halt bilateral aid to the east African country last month, except for \"support to the poorest and most vulnerable\".",
      "The UK took the decision to cut aid after accusing the country of supporting M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising.",
      "The aid cuts have amounted to \"unjustified punitive measures to coerce Rwanda into compromising our national security\", Makolo said on Monday.",

      "Trump - who has long called for European members of the Nato military alliance to spend more on defence - is also attempting to cut a rapid deal to bring the Ukraine war to an end after speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Last week, a White House meeting on a mineral deal - seen as key to continuing US support of Ukraine - erupted into argument. Trump and his Vice President, JD Vance, accused Zelensky of not being grateful enough.",
      "The angry exchange meant the deal, that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals, was left unsigned.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Sunak emphasised his close relationship with Zelensky - having visited Kyiv during his time as prime minister.",
      "Sunak stressed he agreed with Trump that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own defence and not rely solely on the US.",
      "\"We can't expect America to bear any burden for our security if we are not prepared to make those sacrifices ourselves,\" he said.",
      "\"What has happened over the last few weeks has been clarifying, and we have just had to be open and honest about that now.\"",

      "\"That is the first job of any British prime minister.",
      "\"We are living in a new world that all of us are going to have to adjust to - and that was the case even before the US election.\"",
      "As prime minster, Sunak committed the government to increase defence spending to 2.5% by 2030.",
      "The plans were accelerated by Labour, who last week set out plans to hit the target by 2027 - funded through a cut to Overseas Development Aid.",

    "story": [
      "Before he came to the throne, the then Prince Charles had been challenged over whether he could avoid meddling and stay out of politics when he became King.",
      "Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy.",
      "He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting.",
      "Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an \"unprecedented\" sign of friendship and respect.",
      "Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country.",
      "It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US.",
      "It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations.",
      "The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia.",
      "With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky.",
      "Trump described the King as a \"beautiful man\", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government.",
      "The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral.",
      "For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the \"indescribable aggression\" against Ukraine, in what he called an \"unprovoked attack on their land\".",
      "Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values.",
      "He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel.",
      "But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation.",
      "\"Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,\" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting.",
      "Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians.",
      "They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president.",
      "Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the \"special relationship\" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada.",
      "Warm reception for Zelensky as he meets King at Sandringham",
      "Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind",
      "Blue and yellow flowers as Queen meets Trudeau",
      "The BBC's Royal Watch newsletter has already had plenty of feedback from Canadians who are angry that the King has not spoken up for them against Trump.",
      "\"I am a 73-year-old proud Canadian and loyal royal supporter. Should the King choose a relationship with Trump over support of Canada, I will be changing my support to withdrawing from the Commonwealth,\" emailed Peggy.",
      "\"I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all,\" Ann said in an email to the newsletter.",
      "\u200cIt won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK.",
      "It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion.",
      "And who was she meeting? A popular young Canadian prime minister called Justin Trudeau. It was seen as a sign of Western solidarity to support Ukraine.",

      "And what if voters simply want change after what will be 27 years of Labour in power come the 2026 Senedd election?",
      "The other parties sense that change in the air and will spend the next year arguing that two Labour governments working together are not doing enough for Wales and that the Welsh government's spending priorities are wrong.",
      "Labour for its part tried to put Plaid on the defensive during the budget debate, accusing it of jeopardising billions of pounds of funding by not backing the spending plans."

    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",
      "The OBR later concluded \u00a34bn of the \u00a312bn a year promised cuts had not been achieved.",

    "story": [
      "From speeches watched by millions to a position as her party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars.",
      "However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.",
      "Black believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.",
      "The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.",
      "Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.",
      "She said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.",
      "\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.",
      "The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.",
      "She said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went.",
      "\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"",
      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",
      "\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland.",
      "\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.",
      "\"I don't know what I've done to make you viscerally hate me that much.\"",
      "Since politics she has performed a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival and spent time talking about politics on various TV shows and podcasts.",
      "There does not appear to be any second guessing about her decision to stand down though, as she enjoys a walk with her dog in the new documentary.",
      "\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.  I've done my bit,\" she says.",
      "\"Doing something normal on a Tuesday, going for a walk with my wee best pal, is much better than running around Westminster.\"",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

    "summary": "The prime minister will soon need evidence to show he can be a bridge between Trump and Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",
      "But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out.",
      "UK won't be derailed by Ukraine aid freeze - Rayner",
      "Ukraine's shock over US military aid pause",
      "It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together.",
      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine?",
      "The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US.",
      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",
      "And Sir Keir said there would be a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace.",
      "Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be \"a force consisting of European and other partners\".",
      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",
      "The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop.",
      "The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace.",
      "Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly \"to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing\".",
      "This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.",

      "The summit in London was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. Diplomats said there was clear resolve around the table to support Ukraine but also to build on Trump's desire to find a ceasefire.",
      "But Europe stepping up is only half of the story and much depends on whether the US is willing to play its part.",
      "Diplomats say the US is willing to de-escalate the tensions with Zelensky, but there were mixed messages on Sunday. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine, but the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire.",

    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",
      "But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.",

      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",

      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",

    "summary": "The government wants to adopt a scheme which encourages inmates to gain qualifications and take jobs.",
    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",
      "Prison gangs: \u2018I've chopped people,  attacked staff, hidden drugs\u2019",
      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",
      "But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.",
      "Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.",
      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",
      "The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",

    "summary": "But Intuitive Machines said it had yet to confirm the \"orientation\" and condition of the spacecraft.",
    "story": [
      "A private US company says it has landed a spacecraft close to the Moon's South Pole, carrying scientific instruments including a hopping robot and the first lunar mobile communications antenna.",
      "But Intuitive Machines said it had yet to confirm the \"orientation\" of the spacecraft, called Athena, and was working to confirm its condition.",
      "The company is partnering with US space agency Nasa to look for evidence of water and ice on the lunar surface.",
      "Lunar landings are very difficult, and the company will be hoping the touchdown was smooth after its first craft landed on its side last year.",
      "The spacecraft Athena landed shortly after 1730GMT (1230EST).",
      "A picture should soon be released showing Athena about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole in an area of the lunar highlands called Mons Mouton.",
      "If the landing has been successful, the craft will have 10 days to complete scientific observations and measurements.",
      "The instruments on board include a jumping robot called Micro Nova Hopper or Grace, which is designed to leap and fly across the Moon's surface to reach a large crater that is in permanent shade.",
      "The hopper should be released from the main spacecraft in coming days and fly up to 100m in altitude.",
      "It will travel up to 1.2 miles (2km) and after five leaps, it should land inside the crater with a camera to take the first images of the interior.",
      "The crater is in permanent shadow from the Sun's rays, so it has very low temperatures and is considered an ideal place to look for ice.",
      "Intuitive Machines, which made the hopper, say it can travel to places that other machines, like robots with wheels, can't reach or would take a very long time to get to.",
      "\"These hoppers are really suited to the lunar environment because there's no atmosphere there, practically speaking, so doing a series of controlled leaps is a great way to move around,\" says Prof Simeon Barber, a lunar scientist with the Open University.",
      "The IM-2 mission is also carrying three scientific instruments made by Nasa.",
      "A drill called Trident will churn up rocks to reach the surface under the Moon to see if there is evidence of ice.",
      "Then an instrument called a mass spectrometer will analyse any gases that are released.",
      "And a type of antenna mast developed with Nokia should also be planted on the Moon that uses the same 4G cellular technology as on Earth.",
      "The mission is part of Nasa's long-term goal to take humans back to the lunar surface, as the agency hopes to send astronauts in 2027 with the Artemis programme.",
      "\"This is another step towards assessing the viability of the lunar South Pole as a place to go and set up future bases for humans,\" says Prof Barber.",
      "Experts want to explore options for building settlements and find out if there are reserves of water that could provide drinking water and potentially be turned into oxygen.",
      "\"A lot of planning of future exploration is being predicated on the presence of water ice, but if you want to use it, you need to know where it is and how much there is,\" says Prof Barber.",
      "Nasa is partnering with a range of private companies that transport spacecraft and instruments to the Moon. It says this is cheaper than developing and blasting off their own missions.",
      "Intuitive Machines successfully landed a craft called Odysseus on the Moon in February last year, but it tipped over during the descent, meaning not all the scientific work could be carried out.",
      "Space agencies globally are competing to build human settlements on the Moon in a race to exploit resources and advance scientific understanding of other worlds.",
      "In the US, the Moon mission is seen as a stepping stone for the longer-term and much more ambitious goal of human settlement on Mars.",
      "The IM-2 mission could also help to answer broader questions about why there is ice in the inner solar system, closer to the Sun's warming rays.",
      "\"The permanently shadowed regions on the Moon are kind of a store and archive of ancient water that might have been delivered to the Earth-Moon system after their formation,\" explains Prof Mark Fox-Powell at the Open University."

    "story": [
      "Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study.",
      "Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York.",
      "A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.",
      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers.",
      "Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems.",
      "They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species.",
      "Southwest US most affected",
      "Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses.",
      "\"Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants,\" Prof Grames explained.",
      "The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection.",
      "Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery.",
      "\"Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "She also stressed the need for government action.",
      "\"Insects are fundamental to life on earth, and we need conservation actions and policies that support insects.\""

    "story": [
      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",
      "Dr Raffan explained: \"It alters the predisposition to weight gain because it's tweaking a system that is involved in regulating how hungry we feel and how much energy we burn off.\"",
      "The findings could help in the future development of new drugs to tackle obesity. But the scientists say they reveal how much harder people - and owners of dogs - with this genetic predisposition have to work to offset its effects.",

      "What we've identified here is a different pathway [from the one targeted by those drugs],\" explained Dr Raffan.",
      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

    "story": [
      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "The UK competition watchdog has ended its investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was looking into whether Microsoft's relationship with what is the world's best known artificial intelligence (AI) firm changed after the turmoil which saw its boss Sam Altman fired and then rehired.",
      "The CMA has concluded that, despite Microsoft investing billions of dollars into OpenAI and having exclusive uses of some of its AI products, the partnership remains the same, so is not subject to review under the UK's merger rules.",
      "Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been \"defanged.\"",
      "The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked.",
      "\"In view of Microsoft's potentially important role in securing Sam Altman's re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAI's commercial policy,\" the watchdog said.",
      "But on Wednesday, it concluded Microsoft \"exerts a high level of material influence\" over OpenAI's commercial policy without fully controlling it.",
      "\"Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK's merger control regime,\" CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn.",
      "But he added: \"The CMA's findings on jurisdiction should not be read as the partnership being given a clean bill of health on potential competition concerns; but the UK merger control regime must of course operate within the remit set down by Parliament.\"",

      "\"The CMA has sat on this decision for over a year, yet within just a few weeks of a former Amazon boss being installed as chair, it has decided everything was absolutely fine all along, nothing to see here,\" said Foxglove co-executive director Rosa Curling.",
      "\"This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech \u2013 just like they did the last one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",
      "But in a set of instructions to the CMA issued in February, the government said it should prioritise \"pro-growth and pro-investment interventions\".",
      "The same month the UK sided with the US in not signing an agreement on AI at a summit in Paris.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance had told delegates that too much regulation of AI could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\".",
      "\"The CMA will be taking a less interventionist approach to protecting competition and to merger control reviews, [but] this does not mean the CMA will approve every deal presented to it without question,\" said Chloe Birkett, competition lawyer at  law firm Freeths.",
      "\"The CMA's purpose is to help preserve competition in markets to ensure that consumers get a fair deal,\" she said.",

      "John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said it would look at  whether TikTok's data collection practices could lead to children experiencing harms, such as data being leaked or spending \"more time than is healthy\" on the platform.",
      "TikTok told the BBC its recommender systems operated under \"strict and comprehensive measures that protect the privacy and safety of teens\".",
      "It added that the platform also has \"robust restrictions on the content allowed in teens' feeds\".",

      "Imgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month.   However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK.",
      "\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC.",
      "\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites.",
      "\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"",
      "A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".",
      "Imgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.",
      "Next steps",
      "The investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law.",
      "But companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.",
      "\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.",
      "It is not the first time TikTok has faced scrutiny from the ICO.  The platform is appealing against an ICO fine of \u00a312.7m in 2023 for misusing children's data issued in 2023."

      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",

      "So what happened?",

      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",

      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",

      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",

      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

    "story": [
      "Caroline Darian, the daughter of Dominique and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, is pressing charges against her father, accusing him of drugging and raping her - something he has always denied.",
      "Last December, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail for drugging his ex-wife, Gis\u00e8le, raping her and inviting dozens of men to also abuse her over nearly a decade.",
      "Pelicot filmed the rapes of his wife, collecting hundreds of videos he neatly catalogued on a hard disk.",
      "Among them were also two photos of his daughter, in which Ms Darian, 46, says she is clearly unconscious, sleeping in an unfamiliar position and wearing underwear she doesn't recognise.",
      "Dominique Pelicot has offered conflicting explanations for the photos, but has always denied sexually assaulting his daughter.",
      "Ms Darian has long said the photos are proof her father also drugged and raped her.",
      "\"I know that he drugged me, probably for sexual abuse. But I don't have any evidence,\" she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time.",
      "Police will now launch an investigation, and prosecutors will later decide whether to proceed to trial.",
      "B\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising\".",
      "But she also pointed out that the prosecutors in the previous trial had said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter.",
      "The heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world. \"I never touched you, never,\" Pelicot pleaded to his daughter during one session. \"You are lying!\" Ms Darian shouted back.",
      "Ms Darian has previously said she felt she was the trial's \"forgotten victim\" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted upon her.",
      "She told Elle France earlier this week that the charges she is pressing against her father were \"symbolic\" but \"in line with what I have said since the start: that I am a victim of chemical submission [drug-facilitated assault] but was never recognised as such\".",
      "She has hired lawyer Florence Rault to represent her.",
      "For many years, Ms Rault has been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s.",
      "One, a young property agent known by the pseudonym Marion, was the victim of an attempted rape in 1999, to which Pelicot has admitted.",
      "The other - also an estate agent in her 20s - was raped and murdered in 1991. Pelicot is currently being investigated over that case, but has always denied any involvement.",
      "Ms Darian said she saw similarities between her and Marion. \"We look strangely alike. She is blonde, her hair is bobbed, we were born the same year... I wanted to meet her lawyer and hear all the details,\" she told Elle France.",
      "In her police complaint, which was quoted by French media, Ms Rault lamented that Ms Darian had never been offered gynecological examinations nor had she been tested for the drugs Pelicot used on his wife.",
      "Ms Rault said the investigation had only focused on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and that her client had been treated as a \"peripheral victim\". She asked the authorities to launch a fresh \"serious and in-depth\" inquiry.",
      "Forty-nine men were sentenced in December alongside Dominque Pelicot. All were found guilty of at least one charge - rape or sexual assault - against Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.",
      "Seventeen initially said they would appeal the charges against them, but seven of those have since changed their minds.",
      "Those who decide to press ahead with their appeals will go on trial at the end of the year in N\u00eemes, southern France.",
      "The first trial - which lasted from September to December 2024 - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",

      "A local resident told Yonhap that he had been watching television at home when the explosion, which sounded \"like a thunderclap\", shook the house.",
      "The director of a nearby senior citizen care centre said that the building's windows shattered and one of their teachers was taken to hospital with injuries. While no seniors were hurt, they said, \"they were so frightened that we sent them all home\".",
      "Pocheon authorities told the BBC earlier on Thursday that residents had been evacuated while a bomb disposal team worked on safely disposing any unexploded bombs.",
      "But authorities later said they did not find any unexploded bombs at the scene, Yonhap reported.",
      "The defence ministry said the training on Thursday was related to a joint drill with US forces.",
      "South Korea and the US are set to run combined drills from March 10 to March 20 - the first since US president Donald Trump's return to the White House. This comes at a time when the two countries are increasingly wary of the growing alliance between North Korea and Russia.",
      "During another joint drill by South Korea and the US in 2022, troops fired a short-range ballistic missile which malfunctioned and crashed on a golf course in the military base. While the warhead did not explode, it still burst into flames and sent panic rippling across residents in the area."

    "summary": "The president has pledged to eliminate the federal agency that oversees the US education system.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is considering an executive order that would shut down the US Department of Education - a long-cherished goal of conservatives.",
      "The move would deliver on a promise he made on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump plans to end some of the department's programmes, while others would be housed within different parts of the government, according to US media reports.",
      "The Republican president will direct his newly confirmed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Education Department\" based on \"the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law\", according to a draft of the order seen by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Abolishing the department entirely requires an act of Congress, however.",
      "Established in 1979, the Department of Education oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.",
      "Trump and his allies have accused the agency of \"indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material\".",
      "In December, he nominated former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and his transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, as his pick for education secretary.",
      "What does the Department of Education do?",
      "A common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts.",
      "The agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university.",
      "It also helps fund programmes to support students with disabilities and for students living in poverty.",
      "And the department enforces civil rights law designed to prevent race or sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools.",
      "What is its budget and how many people work there?",
      "The department's allocation was $238bn (\u00a3188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget.",
      "The agency says it has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department.",
      "Most public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments.",
      "In 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil.",
      "Can Trump shut down the department?",
      "On his own, no.",
      "Not only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of the department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US Senate - 60 out of 100 senators.",
      "Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would need at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political longshot.",
      "Even in the House of Representatives, Trump would struggle to gain necessary support.",
      "A vote last year to abolish the education department - which was attached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans joined all Democrats in the House to vote no.",
      "Trump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent weeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves.",
      "An earlier draft of Trump's order to dismantle the education department, obtained last month by the Washington Post, acknowledged that only Congress can get rid of the agency outright, but executive action could direct the agency to begin to wind itself down.",
      "Education department employees are among those who are the focus of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce.",
      "Why do Republicans want to abolish it?",
      "The idea of eliminating the education department has been floated by Republicans for nearly as long as it has existed.",
      "During Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, he pushed for it to be dismantled.",
      "Republicans have historically pushed against centralising education policy, believing that it is best left up to individual states and localities.",
      "More recently they have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as \"woke\" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race.",
      "Trump's allies also want to expand school choice, which would allow students and families to use public money to select private or religious alternatives to public schools.",
      "Conservatives argue that other education department functions, such as administering loans, should be handled instead by the US Department of Treasury, and that civil rights infractions are the Department of Justice's domain."

      "Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office responded with a terse statement, saying only that it had \"expressed its position\" on the talks.",
      "By the end of the day, after meeting in the Oval Office with some previously released American hostages, Trump again turned up the heat on the group. He took to Truth Social to call it \"sick and twisted\" and issue a \"last warning\" that if members didn't release all the hostages there would be \"hell to pay\".",
      "\"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job,\" he wrote, \"not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say.\"",

      "\"And Hamas called them out. They said, President Trump, your threats have no meaning.\"",
      "Press secretary Karoline Leavitt had earlier placed the president's dramatic changes of course into the context of Trump's larger foreign policy, telling reporters that \"dialogue and talking to people around the world\" is a part of his \"good faith effort to do what's right for the American people\".",
      "Zelensky comes around",
      "The White House has employed similar logic to Trump's recent efforts to thaw US relations with Moscow, including dispatching high-level administration officials to Saudi Arabia to meet directly with a Russian delegation.",
      "That dramatic diplomatic about-face accompanied sharp criticism of Ukraine and its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, which culminated in Friday's heated meeting in the Oval Office. An announcement followed this week saying that the US had suspended arms shipments, and another on Wednesday said intelligence-sharing with the war-torn nation was paused.",

    "story": [
      "War, cross-border conflict and geopolitical upheaval are rarely deemed good for business.",
      "Yet that appears to have been the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on two of the aggressor's neighbours to its west \u2013 Finland and Sweden.",
      "Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations' response to the invasion that turned fear into hope.",
      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",
      "In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out.",

      "Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine",
      "And while the White House this week announced a pause in US military aid to Ukraine, European leaders have declared they're in it for the long haul, so here too we can expect substantial and ongoing spending on arms.",
      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with their obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",
      "\"The US really protects its own defence industry, and we should do the same in Europe,\" he says, as he welcomes \"fierce competition\" between commercial defence companies.",
      "Much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defence industry, however.",
      "Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato.",
      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",
      "Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free.",
      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",
      "Nato's newest members believe they could teach other allied countries a thing or two about defence. They clearly offer new perspectives both on how defence spending should be measured. And perhaps also on how civilian society and private enterprise can play their parts.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 22:47:04 GMT",
    "summary": "The \"Made in China\" juggernaut was built over decades. Can Trump's moves set it back?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.",
      "This is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes.",
      "Trump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.",
      "China's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (\u00a3788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).",
      "It has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s.",
      "So how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?",
      "What are tariffs and how do they work?",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.",
      "Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.",
      "So, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.",
      "Increasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.",
      "Trump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.",
      "Trump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US.",
      "He also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "Can Trump's tariffs hurt China's factories?",
      "Yes, analysts say.",
      "Exports have been the \"saving grace\" of China's economy and if the taxes linger,  exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC.",
      "The sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus.",
      "\"The tariffs will hurt China,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. \"They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.\"",
      "That is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs.",
      "Chinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.",
      "While tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.",
      "\"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,\" Ms Garcia-Herrero said.",
      "China had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such  as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an \"early mover\" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.",
      "Chinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.",
      "\"It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.\"",
      "How is China responding to Trump's tariffs?",
      "China has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.",
      "And it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.",
      "China has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.",
      "And yet, Trump's recent  tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because  Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.",
      "\"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,\" she said.",
      "What concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips.",
      "These restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.",
      "It's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.",
      "Although this could \"impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,\" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.",
      "On the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will  boost its high-value exports.",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "The truth behind your $12 dress: Inside the Chinese factories fuelling Shein's success",
      "How did China become a manufacturing superpower?",
      "It happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.",
      "\"The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,\" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.",
      "The government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.",
      "A shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.",
      "China already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world.",
      "\"The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,\" said Mr Cruise of Moody's.",
      "But that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.",
      "Analysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico.",
      "Chinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other."

      "With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five.",
      "But the tide has turned.",
      "For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge.",
      "India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third.",
      "\"For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,\" Mr Kumar says.",
      "Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; \u00a316,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. \"Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,\" he says.",
      "His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution.",
      "The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media \"finfluencers\" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike.",
      "Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor.",
      "When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market.",
      "\"I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!\"",
      "For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. \"I'm both ignorant and confident,\" he says with wry candour. \"Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype.\"",
      "Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. \"The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,\" he says.",
      "In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. \"When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed.\"",
      "Mr Sircar lives in hope. \"My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green.\"",
      "There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic.",
      "Hooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market.",
      "\"I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me,\" he says.",
      "Ramesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in.",
      "\"This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic,\" says financial adviser Samir Doshi. \"Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next.\"",
      "Fuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets.",
      "On the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. \"The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations,\" says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. \"Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?\"",
      "This market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses.",
      "\"In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings,\" noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst.",
      "\"Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances.\"",
      "Financial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. \"We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event.\"",
      "But clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs.",
      "Foreign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite.",
      "Mr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious.",
      "In the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors.",
      "\"This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal,\" says Ms Halan. \"If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control.\"",

      "The film \u2014 which is about a young sex worker from New York who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, before his parents find out and put her Cinderella story in jeopardy \u2014 took home five out of the six awards it was nominated for. The only one not nabbed was best supporting actor, which went to Kieran Culkin for \"A Real Pain.\"",
      "As the writer, editor and director of \"Anora,\" Baker himself won four Oscars for the film, setting a record for most Oscars won by one person for a single film. Mikey Madison took home the fifth with her best actress win.",
      "In his remarks on stage after winning the Oscar for best editing, Baker said only three individuals are allowed in the editing room with him.",
      "\"Those three people are Samantha Quan, my wife and producer, Alex Coco, my incredible fellow producer, and my dog, Bunson, he gave me some pretty good notes,\" Baker joked.",
      "This is the first year Baker himself has been nominated by the Academy. In 2018, Willem Defoe, who starred in Baker's \"The Florida Project,\" earned a best supporting actor nomination.",
      "Baker, whose wife, Samathan Quan, co-produced \"Anora,\"\u00a0revealed to NPR that he had a $6 million budget for the independent film, distributed by Neon. The film only took 40 days to film, with 10 days of shooting going to one infamous scene inside a mansion in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, according to director of photography Drew Daniels.",
      "The film went on to gross more than $40 million worldwide and also won the Palme d'Or \u2014 the highest award for directors of feature films \u2014 at the Cannes Film Festival, plus two BAFTAs and a Critics Choice Award.",
      "During his acceptance speech for best director, Baker encouraged audiences to go back to movie theaters to see films, saying \"the theater-going experience is under threat.\"",
      "\"Watching a film in a theater with an audience is an experience. We can laugh together, cry together. And in a time in which our world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever: It's a communal experience you simply don't get at home,\" he said.",
      "During his acceptance speech for best original screenplay, he thanked the sex worker community, as the main character in \"Anora\" works in a strip club and is hired as an escort. \"They have shared their stories. They have shared life experiences with me over the years. My deepest respect. Thank you. I share this with you,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:05:52 -0500",
    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

      "One of Hollywood's finest actors, two-time Academy Award-winner Gene Hackman\u00a0died this past week at age 95. And while circumstances surrounding his death (along with his wife, Betsy Arakawa) remain very much a mystery, his legacy is in a class all its own.",

      "What set Hackman apart? \"He was definitely part of a crop of interesting young Hollywood actors that kind of reinvented the mold,\" Rooney said. \"They were getting away from the traditional movie star, into something more approaching real people. He wasn't sort of a matinee idol-look, but it was at the point when people were looking beyond that to try and find some other kind of realism in movies.\"",

    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",

      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",

      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

      "\"Walking the individual through the different movements, hand placement, how to press down and deeper is instrumental in teaching them how to do it,\"\u00a0 Brenda Robles Cooke with Delaware Valley Community Health said.",
      "This center is the largest provider of health care to the Latino community in Philadelphia, serving about 23,000 patients every year.",
      "\"Health centers like this are pillars in Philadelphia's neighborhoods,\" Dr. Rich Snyder with Independent Blue Cross said.",
      "The kiosk is strategically placed here because research from the American Heart Association says Latinos and Hispanics are 40% less likely to receive CPR from a bystander.",
      "\"So being able to remove barriers to access and education and bring the kiosk to where patients are already coming is really going to be beneficial in helping us to improve bystander response rates, which will improve cardiac arrest survival rates,\" Jeffrey Salvatore with the American Heart Association said.",
      "Salvatore says most people in Philadelphia traditionally don't perform CPR on strangers. This kind of training aims to reverse that trend.",
      "\"It allows people to get that hands-on education and feeling, it'll be a muscle memory in hopes that they will act in case of an emergency,\" Salvatore said.",
      "He says the kiosk is designed for self-paced learning, making it accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds.",
      "\"Very good because we people need very badly training in those CPR skills.,\" Wilfredo Vargas-Padilla of North Philadelphia said.",
      "Because you never know when you'll have a chance to save a life.",

    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",

      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",
      "The last large outbreak of the virus in the U.S. was in Illinois last year. It was largely confined to migrant shelters in Chicago.",

It's used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman's immune system attacks her fetus' red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh-negative blood type and her baby's is Rh-positive.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",

But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",

    "summary": "Consumers are likely to face higher costs for some imported goods, experts say. Here's the potential impact on your wallet.",
    "story": [
      "American consumers could soon face higher costs for a range of consumer products after President Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China went into effect on Tuesday.",
      "The 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico, plus an additional 10% tax on imports from China, will drive up the costs of an array of consumer goods, from groceries to automobiles, and could cause more financial strain for inflation-weary consumers, experts say.",
      "Because importers pay the tariffs \u2014 such as Walmart, which imports goods from China and other nations \u2014 U.S. businesses will shoulder the added costs. While some companies may opt to swallow all or part of the expense, some of the costs are likely to be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say.",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "The typical American family could face higher annual costs of between $1,600 to $2,000 due to the new tariffs, according to a new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan public policy research center.",
      "What will cost more with tariffs?",
      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers. But some products that are made in the U.S. but which use imported materials could also see higher prices, such as automobiles that are manufactured domestically but rely on parts imported from Canada, Mexico or China.",
      "Consumers could start seeing higher prices for some products fairly quickly, such as gasoline, with some regions expected to see gas prices jump as much as 40 cents per gallon within days, according to GasBuddy energy analyst Patrick De Haan.",
      "But other goods, such as cars, might not reflect higher prices for several months, experts say.",
      "Vegetables, fruit, beef, beer and spirits",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico in 2023. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. imported roughly $40 billion worth of Canadian agricultural products, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "Subject to 25% tariffs, prices on such products could rise substantially, depending on how much of the cost increase businesses pass along to shoppers. Fresh produce prices could increase by about 3%, while food prices overall may increase by 2%, according to a new analysis from Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.",
      "According to the\u00a0Atlanta Fed, the tariffs on three key U.S. trading partners would bring up prices on everyday purchases, including food and beverages, by as much as 1.63%, if businesses pass along anywhere from half to all of the added costs to consumers.",
      "Electronics",
      "The tariffs are likely to drive up prices on a range of consumer goods, including laptops and tablets, video game consoles and smartphones, according to an analysis from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).",
      "Computers, phones and other electronics could see prices jump by 11%, according to the Joint Economic Committee analysis.",
      "That's a reality electronics retailer Best Buy acknowledged last year\u00a0as Mr. Trump spoke about relying on tariffs to achieve his economic goals.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Automobiles",
      "Trump on Wednesday gave automakers a one-month exemption from the tariffs, his spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. The move came after calls between Trump and the leaders of the big three automakers \u2014 Ford, GM and Stellantis (the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram).",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referring to the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated during his first term.",
      "But U.S. automakers would feel the pain if tariffs move ahead given their complex supply chains which can involve car parts crossing borders multiple times over the course of assembly, exposing them to the same levies more than once.",
      "The sweeping tariffs could drive up car costs\u00a0by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, which could dent automobile sales, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some automakers could ditch uneconomical product lines as a result of the tariffs. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Gasoline",
      "Fuel prices could quickly reflect the new tariffs, according to De Haan of GasBuddy. Oil, natural gas and electricity imported from Canada will be subject to a 10% levy that could lead to higher prices almost immediately for U.S. motorists.",
      "\"Some U.S. regions will see price impacts rather quickly, while others will see a delay of 1-3 weeks,\" De Haan wrote in a March 4 blog post.",
      "Drivers in the Northeast are likely to see the biggest immediate impact, with gas prices jump by between 20 to 40 cents per gallon by mid-March, he added. \"For a typical 15-gallon fill-up, that's an additional $3-$6 every time you visit the pump,\" he said.",
      "Other regions are also likely to see higher gas prices, with Midwest drivers seeing an increase of 5-20 cents per gallon and Great Lakes motorists likely to pay about 10-25 cents per gallon more due to the new tariffs, he added.",

The Trump administration on Tuesday announced 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% levy on Chinese imports, which were already taxed at 10%. The barrage of trade measures has raised concerns of higher prices in the U.S. for a range of goods, such as produce and cars.",

    "story": [
      "Layoffs across the U.S. spiked in February, reaching their highest levels since July 2020, led by widespread firings of government workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",
      "\"When mass layoffs occur, it often leaves remaining staff feeling uneasy and uncertain. The likelihood that many more workers leave voluntarily is high,\" Andrew Challenger, workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The impact of the DOGE cuts haven't yet shown up in official government data, with the Labor Department saying Thursday that the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell by 21,000 to 221,000 for the week ending March 1.",

    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 Utah on Wednesday became the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
      "The bill headed to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox has pitted Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, against app store giants Apple and Google over who should be responsible for verifying ages. Similar bills have been introduced in at least eight other states in the latest fight over children's online safety. The proposals targeting app stores follow legal fights over laws requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of users.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don't do enough to make their products safe for children - or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "\"Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,\" Meta, X and Snap Inc. said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We applaud Utah for putting parents in charge with its landmark legislation and urge Congress to follow suit.\"",
      "The app stores say app developers are better equipped to handle age verification and other safety measures. Requiring app stores to confirm ages will make it so all users have to hand over sensitive identifying information, such as a driver's license, passport, credit card or Social Security number, even if they don't want to use an age-restricted app, Apple said.",
      "\"Because many kids in the U.S. don't have government-issued IDs, parents in the U.S. will have to provide even more sensitive documentation just to allow their child to access apps meant for children. That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy,\" the company said in its most recent online safety report.",
      "Apple considers age a matter of privacy and lets users decide whether to disclose it. The company gives parents the option to set age-appropriate parameters for app downloads. The Google Play Store does the same.",
      "Apple and Google are among a litany of tech companies that help support the Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that lobbied Utah lawmakers to reject the bill. Last year, Apple helped kill a similar bill in Louisiana that would have required app stores to help enforce age restrictions.",
      "Kouri Marshall, a spokesperson for the Chamber of Progress, called the measure \"a tremendous encroachment of individual privacy\" that he said places a heavy burden on app stores to ensure online safety.",
      "Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, the bill's sponsor, argued it's \"a lot easier to target two app stores than it is to target 10,000 (app) developers.\"",
      "Under the bill, app stores would be required to request age information when someone creates an account. If a minor tries to open one, the bill directs the app store to link it to their parent's account and may request a form of ID to confirm their identity. Weiler said a credit card could be used as an age verification tool in most cases.",
      "If a child tries to download an app that allows in-app purchases or requires them to agree to terms and conditions, the parent will first have to approve.",
      "Melissa McKay, a Utah mother, is among those who pushed for the legislation. She said she started asking questions about device safety after her nephew in 2017 was exposed to \"really harmful content on another student's device at school.\" Inaccurate age ratings on apps and faulty parental controls are \"at the root of online harm,\" McKay said.",
      "The eight other states considering proposals would similarly place responsibility on app stores to verify ages and seek parental permissions. A legislative committee advanced Alabama's bill last week.",
      "Lawsuits have delayed implementation of state laws regulating social media apps and websites. A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah's first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "If Cox signs the Utah bill into law, most provisions would take effect May 7. The governor's office didn't respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, supported the state law currently on hold that requires age verification on social media."

      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",

      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

      "Beijing \u2014 China has responded to President Trump's trade war with defiance, something Mr. Trump is not accustomed to. Now facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the U.S., Beijing has refused to back down \u2014 despite its own economic problems \u2014 and is hitting the U.S. with its own retaliatory tariffs. The air of strength from Beijing was projected clearly on Wednesday at the opening of the National People's Congress.",
      "Thousands of delegates from around the country descended on the Chinese capital's central Tiananmen Square. Dressed in their finery, including some in traditional garments, they came to Beijing for the most important event in China's political calendar. But for the members of China's rubber-stamp legislature, certain topics were clearly off limits when speaking with CBS News.",
      "None of the legislators would respond when asked about any concerns they might have regarding the trade war between the world's two largest economies, or whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping might be able to get over their differences.",
      "Once inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People, the cameras turned to the main event. While the NPC is focused mainly on China's sluggish economy, this year, that discussion and the public proclamations are being overshadowed by geopolitical events \u2014 and the trade war with the U.S. in particular.",
      "President Xi, who's government announced its retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. just one day before the NPC opened, was an observer at the massive gathering on Wednesday. His deputy, Premier Li Qiang, delivered the keynote address.",
      "He announced an ambitious\u00a0GDP growth target of 5% and committed more fiscal resources aimed at stimulating the economy, which is mired in youth unemployment and weak consumer spending, in addition to the lingering fallout from a property crisis.",

      "\"As this sort of rivalry goes on, there will come a point where we can have a good settlement,\" predicted Delegate Lin Shun-chao, from Hong Kong.",
      "While many Chinese people hope Beijing and Washington will eventually reach a trade deal, it's worth noting how stock markets in both countries have reacted to the tit-for-tat tariffs thus far: Chinese stocks overall are up about 15% from the beginning of the year, while U.S. markets are down almost 2%.",
      "It's another sign \u2014 and perhaps a more telling one than the rhetoric from the podium at the NPC \u2014 of a belief in China that the country's economy will be able to manage whatever Mr. Trump throws at it.",

    "story": [
      "The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a press release, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings, in a deal valued at $22.8 billion. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",

      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",

      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",

      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

They're slated to take effect March 10. China also imposed export controls and other curbs on about two dozen more U.S. companies.",
      "What's more, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, \"If the United States ... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" according to Agence France-Presse.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his nation would respond with 25% tariffs on some $107 billion worth of U.S. goods over the course of three weeks \u2014 with $20.7 billion immediately \u2014 if the U.S. levies remained in effect. He had said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances and Florida orange juice.",
      "\"Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,\" the Reuters news agency quoted Trudeau as saying.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford told NBC News he was prepared to retaliate by ending shipments of nickel and the transmission of electricity to the U.S. from his province.",
      "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico will respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday in a public event in Mexico City's central plaza, perhaps indicating Mexico still hopes to de-escalate the trade war set off by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Did Canada have tariffs on U.S. products before?",
      "Canada had imposed some limited tariffs on U.S. products before 2025, and vice versa. Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which was signed by President Trump in 2020, the countries had negotiated a complex set of rules aimed at promoting trade.",
      "One of the biggest changes in the USMCA pact was providing American farmers greater access to Canada's dairy markets. That included a plan\u00a0eliminating existing Canadian-imposed tariffs on some U.S. dairy products over a number of years, including whey and margarine.",
      "The U.S. has also previously imposed tariffs on some Canadian products, including duties placed by the first Trump administration on imported softwood lumber. Under the Biden administration, the tariffs on Canadian lumber rose from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",

      "Investors\u00a0reacted negatively\u00a0to Monday's news that the tariffs on Mexico and Canada would take effect as planned, with the stock market slumping on Monday and Tuesday. Trade war fears sent markets falling in Asia and Europe, as well on Tuesday.",
      "\"The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn't just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in an email. \"The sell-off that we are beginning to see has room to run (to the downside) as long as the tariff threats remain more than idle talk.\"",
      "On Monday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if there was room left for Canada and Mexico to arrive at a deal before the deadline.",
      "\"No room left for Mexico or for Canada, no,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"The tariffs, they're all set, they go into effect tomorrow.\"",
      "He has wielded tariffs as an instrument to extract concessions from foreign governments and encourage manufacturing in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form,\" he said at the White House Monday after announcing a $100 billion investment by a Taiwanese semiconductor company. \"And now we're using them.\"",
      "The tariffs are in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern borders, including\u00a0fentanyl entering the United States. Both countries won last-minute delays on the tariffs in February after Sheinbaum and Trudeau vowed to do more to crack down on fentanyl and illegal border crossings.",

The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks.",

      "\"The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn't just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management in a note yesterday. The market's trajectory could continue downward, he added, depending on how long the tariffs remain in effect.",
      "The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy. Shares of Target and Best Buy fell on Tuesday after the retailers warned of higher prices for consumers due to tariffs.",
      "Markets in Europe fell sharply while stocks in Asia saw more modest declines.",
      "\"Last month's reprieve was just a temporary break in the downward trend, because a trade war is something the market didn't believe was possible, so as one (or many) start to unfold, the market will begin pricing in the inevitable damage that will be done to our economy,\" Zaccarelli said.",

      "\"I don't think China will buy any more U.S. farm products. The orders will go to South America,\" Lun said. \"I think all in all, it's a lose-lose situation. Nobody gains anything.\"",
      "Anxiety over tariffs is also bleeding into the corporate side of the economic equation. Target reported Tuesday that sales and profit in the crucial holiday quarter both fell from a year ago, though they were better than expected. The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",
      "Many had hoped Mr. Trump would choose a less painful path on global trade. Monday's loss shaved the S&P 500's gain since Election Day down to just over 1% from a peak of more than 6%. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Mr. Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses.",
      "After the S&P 500 set a record  last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports  on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic  about inflation because of the threat of tariffs. Such pessimism is not unwarranted, according to analysts.",
      "\"Inflation is set to surge as the cost of everyday goods rises, squeezing corporate margins and reshaping supply chains across industries,\" warns Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm\u00a0deVere Group which forecasts that inflation in the US could rise by as much as 2.1%, \"putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain a more hawkish stance for longer than markets had anticipated,\" as a result of tariffs.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-inflation-us-economy/",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Mr. Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "summary": "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\"one Social Security Administration employee said of the agency's plans to slash its workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of dissolving the Education Department, sources tell CBS News, although the timing of such a move is unclear.",
      "Sources confirmed the details of a Wall Street Journal report, which first reported the news, are accurate. According to the Journal, there is a draft version of the executive order.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that no such executive order will not be signed on Thursday, after CBS News and other outlets reported the president planned to sign it as early as that day. Sources said it was possible the signing would be moved to a later date.",
      "\"More Fake News! President Trump is NOT signing an Executive Order on the Department of Education today,\" Leavitt wrote.",
      "Completely eliminating the department would require congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "Senate Democrats held a news conference on Thursday about the planned executive order, with Majoirty Leader Chuck Schumer saying that \"it's no secret that they're aiming to abolish the Department of Education.\"",
      "Dismantling the Department of Education has long been a goal for Republicans, dating back to the Reagan administration. Hours after McMahon was confirmed by the Senate, she issued a memo with the subject line \"Our Department's Final Mission.\" The memo said \"this is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students. I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.\"",
      "Randi Weingarten, the head of the nation's largest teachers' union, the AFT, issued a statement Thursday morning noting an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll with 63% of respondents \"strongly opposed\" to dismantling the Education Department.",
      "\"The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed,\" Weingarten said. \"Trying to abolish it \u2014 which, by the way, only Congress can do \u2014 sends a message that the president doesn't care about opportunity for all kids. Maybe he cares about it for his own kids or his friends' kids or his donors' kids \u2014 but not all kids.\"",

    "summary": "As Russia bombs Ukraine and Trump pushes Zelenskyy for a \"better deal,\" what will it take to end the war Vladimir Putin started?",
    "story": [
      "The CIA chief confirmed Wednesday that the Trump administration had paused not only the flow\u00a0 of military hardware and financial support to Ukraine, but also vital intelligence gathering that has helped Kyiv anticipate and block incoming missile and drone attacks and effectively target Russia's invading forces. The U.S. military's European Command has also said shipments of arms that were already on their way \u2014 approved by the Biden administration but not yet delivered \u2014 have been paused.",
      "The pause is part of President Trump's abrupt shift in policy on Ukraine, which has seen the White House adopt rhetoric closely aligned with Russia's narrative justifying the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. Trump's bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire deal that could involve significant concessions by Kyiv.",
      "Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington moderated by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House's determination to forge a peace deal.",
      "\"The best way I can describe it is like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across their noses \u2014 we got their attention,\" he said. \"But it's a pause, it's not an end. It's then up to them.\"",
      "Kellogg did not play down the severity of the measure, but said it would not have taken Kyiv by surprise, as \"they were warned this was coming. I told them.\"",
      "\"If you take away support like that, of course it's important,\" said Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army, adding: \"But that's why it was done.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said Vladimir Putin will also have to make concessions to bring about a ceasefire, but those have not been outlined by the White House to date. To even engage in real negotiations on a potential ceasefire agreement, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants Zelenskyy to first give the U.S. access to a major share of Ukraine's mineral resources.",
      "Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential",
      "Zelenskyy's reluctance to sign an economic deal thus far, without clear guarantees that it would come with a commitment from the U.S. to help defend Ukraine from further Russian attack, appeared to enrage Mr. Trump during their\u00a0chaotic Oval Office meeting on Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr. Trump has said himself that he trusts Russia to keep any promises it makes.",
      "Ukraine and America's European allies do not trust Putin's Russia. They note that as the Biden administration warned of Russia's looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions.",
      "\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war. \u2026 We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said about a month before Putin ordered the full-scale invasion, sparking the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II.",
      "Given that recent history, Ukraine's former Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News on Wednesday that any talk of a ceasefire with Russia now, without clear security guarantees from the West, would only give Putin time to regroup and rearm his strained military, and then to reinvade.",
      "Could a Ukrainian \"goodwill gesture\" get Trump on board?",
      "\"We are interested in peace, but we are definitely interested in something that would be guaranteed as a peace, and that would not be used by the Russian Federation as a pause to remobilize and to attack with a tsunami wave over Ukraine and also over European countries,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "After Zelenskyy's dressing-down at the White House, Ukrainian officials \u2014 including Zelenskyy himself \u2014 made it clear they were\u00a0still willing to sign an economic agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"I think the only thing that that deal is potentially going to give us is a discussion on another deal,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, suggesting the economic agreement could serve as a framework, \"and the possibility to engage the United States. \u2026 It's a goodwill gesture with hope that it would translate into the U.S. standing with good against the evil.\"",
      "Russia, Europeans stress, has shown no willingness so far to bend on any of its maximalist demands that Ukraine cede the roughly 20% of its territory currently occupied by Putin's forces. The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to any European peacekeeping forces helping maintain a truce.",
      "Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue",
      "Far from any signs of d\u00e9tente, Russian missiles, bombs and explosive drones have continued falling on Ukraine.",
      "Overnight, the attacks intensified. The eastern city of Krivy Rih, President Zelenskyy's hometown, was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. In a post on social media,\u00a0Zelenskyy said among the damaged buildings was a hotel full of aid workers, including some U.S. and British volunteers. At least 30 people were injured in the attack and four killed, Zelenskyy said, adding that none of those killed were from the U.S. or U.K.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness of the Russian Federation to really engage,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, noting that \"every single night\" Ukraine has faced Russian bombardment. \"That is not something that is showing goodwill of terminating these attacks.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants, what Russia wants",
      "Klympush-Tsintsadze said she hoped an agreement with the Trump administration on minerals \"would give us the possibility, hopefully, to come to a real peace settlement,\" but she cautioned that \"a peace settlement that would not have security provisions on the side of our partners would barely hold with the Russian Federation.\"",
      "\"We've been there before,\" she said, stressing that when Russia first attacked her country 11 years ago, sending in forces to seize the Crimean Peninsula while denying their presence, Moscow claimed it was because \"NATO is expanding,\" but she said at the time Ukraine was \"a totally neutral and non-aligned, non-block country.\"",
      "\"And then all the other lies that the Russian Federation has been coming up with against the Ukrainian people, just because they don't want us to exist. They just want to exterminate us as a nation and as a country, and that's their goal. So, in order for us to reach peace, we would have to see the way to that peace settlement \u2014 which definitely comes through a ceasefire, but not necessarily ends with a ceasefire.\"",
      "Moscow has defended its aggression against Ukraine for more than a decade as a justified reaction to the U.S.-led NATO alliance's territory inching toward Russia's western border. That expansion began in the wake of the communist Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, with former Soviet bloc republics choosing to join the Western alliance to ensure their own security.",
      "Ukraine has expressed interest in joining the NATO alliance for over 20 years, and it has cooperated with NATO as a neutral partner for about that long, but it was not given a clear\u00a0path to membership \u2014 largely due to many members worrying it would be seen as a provocation by Russia \u2014 until after Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In 2023, with the war well underway, then-President Biden said he didn't believe Ukraine was \"ready for membership in NATO,\" adding that he didn't see unanimity among the alliance's members \"about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\"",
      "President Trump's administration has\u00a0ruled out Ukraine joining the alliance and launched unilateral negotiations with Russia. That direct Washington-Moscow dialogue and the lack of any clear demands by Mr. Trump for concessions from Putin have stoked fears in Kyiv and Western European capitals about the White House's commitment to both the NATO alliance and to securing a ceasefire in Ukraine that looks like anything other than humiliation and capitulation for pro-Western Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia insists it wants to end the war it started in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump has said he believes Moscow on that point. Speaking Thursday to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on the Russian narrative, pushed since Mr. Trump engaged in talks with Putin, that Europe, to a greater degree than Washington, is to blame for the conflict's enduring nature.",
      "Peskov said that while the U.S. under Mr. Trump \"is not a friendly country to us at the moment, the United States is a country with which we are now trying to revive and restore our bilateral relations.\"",
      "That is not the case, he made clear, of America's NATO allies in Europe.",
      "Ukraine seeks Europe's support, but hopes the \"United States will stand for democracy\"",
      "Peskov cited remarks by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who called Wednesday for Europe to boost its collective military capabilities and assume more responsibility for the continent's defense \u2014 as President Trump has demanded \u2014 as evidence that \"France is really looking for a continuation of the war.\" He said Macron had suggested that \"France is ready to use its nuclear weapons for security purposes and so on,\" claiming the French leader had issued \"a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe, that is, it is very, very confrontational.\"",

      "Macron did reference atomic weapons in his Wednesday night address, saying France's \"deterrent capabilities\" had helped to protect the country \"much more than many of our neighbors\" who do not possess such weapons. He did not mention plans to bolster France's nuclear deterrent specifically, but said that as the Trump administration signals less willingness to come to its European allies' defense, he would consider requests from nations such as Germany to extend \"the protection of our allies on the European continent by our deterrent.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was sent to lawmakers this week showed that budget goals outlined in a House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on Medicaid, clashing with commitments from Republicans not to cut the popular entitlement program.",
      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trup added.",
      "USMCA is in effect until April 2. The tariffs would take effect when it expires.",
      "They are expected to lead to price increases for consumers on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on vehicles won't go into effect immediately, though, after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "The USMCA covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, President Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the USMCA agreement. She acknowledged that tariffs on Mexico could go into effect April 2.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hampton Dellinger, the former head of the office that investigates whistleblower retaliation, has dropped his legal challenge to his firing by President Trump from his role as special counsel.",
      "Dellinger's decision to end his legal fight comes hours after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cleared the way for Mr. Trump to terminate him as leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "The D.C. Circuit granted a request from the president to halt a lower court order that blocked Dellinger's firing. The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, sided with the former special counsel in his challenge to his removal and said in a ruling Saturday that he must remain in the role.",
      "Dellinger's decision to walk away from the case cuts off its path to the Supreme Court, which has in a pair of recent decisions reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will.",
      "\"I'm stopping the fight because, yesterday, circuit court judges reviewing the trial court decision in my favor granted the government's request that I be removed from office while the case continues,\" Dellinger wrote in a statement obtained by CBS News. \"This new ruling means that OSC will be run by someone totally beholden to the president for the months that would pass before I could get a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "The ethics watchdog warned that the harm to those dependent on the agency under a future special counsel sympathetic to the Trump administration \"could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.\"",
      "\"I think the circuit judges erred badly because their willingness to sign off on my ouster \u2014 even if presented as possibly temporary \u2014 immediately erases the independence Congress provided for my position, a vital protection that has been accepted as lawful for nearly fifty years. Until now,\" Dellinger said. \"And given the circuit court's adverse ruling, I think my odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.\"",
      "Dellinger continued to take numerous actions under the scope of his former role while the legal battle over his firing played out. He petitioned against the Trump administration's recent mass firings of federal workers\u00a0and, on Tuesday, argued to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative system for federal workers to appeal employment issues, that the Department of Agriculture's firing of over 5,000 probationary workers violated civil service protections.",
      "Dellinger was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in February 2024 to a five-year term. But on Feb. 7, he received an email from the head of the White House's Presidential Personnel Office informing him that \"your position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "Dellinger swiftly challenged his firing in federal district court, alleging that it was unlawful because federal law restricts his removal by the president only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "Soon after, Jackson ordered Dellinger to be reinstated as special counsel while she considered his request for longer relief.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit and then the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute during the earlier stages and greenlight the president's firing of Dellinger. But last month, the high court declined to immediately step into the fight and instead put off a decision while the proceedings before the district court moved forward.",
      "Then, on Saturday, Jackson ruled in favor of Dellinger and rejected the Trump administration's claim that the removal protections laid out in the Civil Service Reform Act were unconstitutional.",
      "The Justice Department again sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit, which granted its request to halt the district court's ruling while it considered the appeal.",
      "\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the unsigned order from the three-judge panel said.",
      "Dellinger's firing came as part of the president's efforts to overhaul the federal government and reduce its size and spending. Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has removed the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, and fired more than a dozen agency watchdogs, actions that have sparked legal challenges.",
      "A different federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, to be reinstated earlier this month. The Justice Department has appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "Thousands of federal workers deemed probationary have been laid off after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., declined to stop the firings, and the White House personnel and budget offices have told agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "A federal judge in California last month\u00a0found that the mass terminations are likely illegal in a separate case brought by labor unions and nonprofit organizations.",
      "Separately, roughly 75,000 workers accepted Mr. Trump's offer to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30 through a \"deferred resignation\" program.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House voted Thursday morning to censure Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas for disrupting President Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.",
      "In a 224 to 198 vote, the House approved a censure resolution against Green, with 10 Democrats joining all Republicans in favor of the move. Two members, including Green, voted present.",
      "Green is the 28th lawmaker in U.S. history to be censured by the House. After the vote, he was ordered to stand in the well of the chamber while the resolution, which called his behavior \"a breach of proper conduct,\" was read aloud.",
      "Minutes into Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday, Green stood and raised his cane in the president's direction and shouted. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, warned Green to take his seat and \"maintain decorum,\" but Green refused. Johnson then directed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "What does it mean to censure a congressman?",
      "Censure is essentially a formal rebuke by the House for some form of misconduct. The punishment usually requires the censured member to stand in front of the dais in the House chamber while the resolution is read by the presiding member \u2014 Johnson, in Green's case. It does not remove the member from office or impose any other penalties, beyond the reputational damage and historical notoriety that accompanies it.",
      "The practice was relatively rare throughout history, but it has become more frequent in recent years. Three other Democrats \u2014\u00a0Adam Schiff\u00a0of California,\u00a0Rashida Tlaib\u00a0of Michigan and\u00a0Jamaal Bowman\u00a0of New York \u2014 were censured in 2023. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar faced the punishment in 2021.",
      "It was most common during the Civil War and Reconstruction, when 13 members were censured for offenses ranging from assault in the Capitol to insulting another member.",
      "Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, who introduced the resolution to censure Green, said the move was not personal and called it a \"difficult step.\"",
      "\"We cannot ignore the willful disruption intended to stop a proceeding,\" Newhouse, who is one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the Capitol riot, said Wednesday. \"Without decorum, without respect, what do we got? What do we have, truly?\"",
      "Newhouse said Green's behavior reflects on all members of Congress and the moment serves as a reminder \"that we all need to raise our level of accountability.\"",
      "\"This is truly a wakeup call for this chamber,\" he said. \"The lack of decorum has reached a new low. When the president of the United States cannot even come into our chamber invited and complete his speech without the interaction that we saw last night, we have to take this action of censure.\"",
      "Before Green spoke during floor debate on the resolution Wednesday, he walked over to Newhouse and shook his hand. Green said he did not hold any ill will toward Johnson, the officers who escorted him out of the president's speech or those who supported his censure.",
      "\"The president indicated that he had a mandate. I said to the president, 'You do not have a mandate to cut Medicaid.' I have constituents who need Medicaid. They will suffer and some will die if they don't get Medicaid,\" Green said of why he heckled Mr. Trump. \"I would do it again.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said Republicans have shown \"selective outrage\" in their condemnation of certain behavior.",
      "\"I can't believe we're having this debate,\" McGovern said Wednesday.",
      "The conservative House Freedom Caucus, however, thought that the censure did not go far enough and is seeking to remove Green from his committee assignment. The group said it will introduce a resolution to strip him of his seat on the House Financial Services Committee, and expects Johnson to bring it up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Green was censured in a bipartisan vote but he needs real consequences to demonstrate that no one gets to disrupt the People's business in lame attempts to derail President Trump's agenda,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the caucus.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island barred the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance, extending the block he put in place weeks ago in a case brought by a group of 23 states and the District of Columbia while the case moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a preliminary injunction Thursday that prohibits agencies from halting the flow of federal funds awarded to the states through grants, contracts or other financial assistance based on a memo from the Office of Management and Budget issued during President Trump's first days in office.",
      "\"The executive's categorical freeze of appropriated and obligated funds fundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government,\" McConnell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, wrote. \"The interaction of the three co-equal branches of government is an intricate, delicate, and sophisticated balance \u2014 but it is crucial to our form of constitutional governance. Here, the executive put itself above Congress.\"",
      "The judge said that the OMB order freezing federal funds across the government was \"without regard to Congress's authority to control spending,\" and found that the Trump administration failed to point to any statutory or constitutional authority to impose the government-wide pause.",
      "\"The court is not limiting the executive's discretion or micromanaging the administration of federal funds,\" McConnell wrote. \"Rather, consistent with the Constitution, statutes, and caselaw, the court is simply holding that the executive's discretion to impose its own policy preferences on appropriated funds can be exercised only if it is authorized by the congressionally approved appropriations statutes.\"",
      "He said that the freeze has impacted an array of programs, including Head Start and other childcare initiatives, as well as law enforcement and public safety agencies that rely on the federal dollars.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the coalition of states challenging the freeze, cheered the decision and reiterated that the power of the purse rests with Congress.",
      "\"The Trump administration's illegal funding freeze jeopardized law enforcement funding, essential health care and childcare services, and other critical programs that millions of Americans rely on,\" James said in a statement.",
      "McConnell had issued a temporary order at the end of January that ordered OMB to keep federal assistance flowing. His decision, as well as a February order finding that the Trump administration failed to comply with that directive, has made him a target of Mr. Trump's supporters. He is one of several federal judges who have ruled against the Trump administration at the early stages of cases and faced threats of impeachment by congressional Republicans.",
      "The case before McConnell was brought by the group of states and the District of Columbia in response to the OMB memo issued in late January that called for federal agencies to temporarily pause grants, loans and other federal assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders.",
      "The memo targeted roughly $3 trillion in federal assistance programs.",
      "Shortly after it was issued, OMB walked back the memo amid widespread chaos and confusion over what funds were at risk, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said only the memo was rescinded, and the freeze itself would remain in force.",
      "The states brought their challenge to the OMB funding freeze in late January and argued that the directive violated federal law and the separation of powers.",
      "In his decision, McConnell called OMB's pause on federal assistance \"indiscriminate and unpredictable,\" and he said it is \"disingenuous\" to suggest that the challenged pauses stem from independent agency decisions, instead of the OMB directive.",
      "\"Overall, the OMB directive amounted to a command, not a suggestion, that agency defendants shall execute a categorical, indefinite funding freeze to align funding decisions with the president's priorities,\" the judge wrote.",
      "He also noted that there is no evidence Mr. Trump followed the federal law that lays out the procedures for withholding or cutting money appropriated by Congress, the Impoundment Control Act.

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from drastically cutting medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and cost jobs.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries.",
      "Separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide sued to stop the cuts, saying they would cause \"irreparable harm.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Boston had temporarily blocked the cuts last month. Wednesday, she filed a preliminary injunction that puts the cuts on hold for longer while the suits proceed.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded about $35 billion in grants to research groups last year. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers' salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \"indirect\" costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \"overhead,\" but universities and hospitals argue they're far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Under prior policy, the government negotiated those rates with institutions. As an example, an institution with a 50% indirect cost rate would get another $50,000 to cover indirect expenses for a $100,000 project. The NIH's new policy would cap indirect costs at a flat rate of 15% instead, calculated to save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "Current and former\u00a0health\u00a0officials previously told CBS News they were shocked by the change, and stressed federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",

    "summary": "House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with just 10 days left to head off a shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, looking to shore up support for the continuing resolution with less than 10 days to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson has outlined plans for the measure, which is expected to extend funding at current levels through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, and has the backing of President Trump.",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday on social media, calling the continuing resolution \"very important.\"",
      "\"Let's get this Bill done!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "But Republicans are facing pressure to do so without support from Democrats. And whether Johnson can get the measure through the House, with a razor-thin Republican majority, remains to be seen.",
      "Members of the House Freedom Caucus, who often oppose the temporary funding measures, met with the president at the White House Wednesday as Republicans move forward with the funding plan, which could be voted on early next week. After the meeting, Rep. Lauren Boebert said they're ready to move forward with a continuing resolution, called a CR for short, so that the president's agenda can move forward. But other caucus members said they need to see the text first.",
      "\"Look, we haven't seen the final form of the CR,\" said Rep. Andy Harris. \"In concept, the president has said he needs this for his agenda. We support the president's agenda.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he's hoping to release the text of the continuing resolution by the end of the week.",
      "In recent years, funding the government has created a headache for Johnson and his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, because of the narrow GOP majority in the House and opposition to temporary funding measures by a group of conservative hardliners. The dynamic has repeatedly forced Republicans to rely on Democrats to keep the government funded, fueling frustration among members of the House GOP ranks.",
      "But Democrats, now in the minority in both chambers and with few opportunities for leverage, are in a different position. As the Trump administration works to dramatically and quickly downsize large swaths of the executive branch, Democrats have been seeking guardrails on Mr. Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress and are intent on including language in the funding measure. Without the guardrails, Democrats argue that the stopgap measure would give the administration more opportunities to cut federal programs.",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he thinks what Democrats are requesting is \"unconstitutional,\" saying \"this should be a conversation about numbers, and not about limiting the other branch of government.\"",
      "Without support from Democrats, House Republicans must keep their conference in line to approve the stopgap measure. Johnson has touted the approach in recent days, which he billed as one that would keep the government open while House Republicans work to incorporate savings from the DOGE effort and revenue brought in by Trump administration policies. He noted on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that the DOGE cuts wouldn't be included in the forthcoming continuing resolution, while promising a \"very different process\" on next year's funding.",
      "During the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March to set Republicans up to reach an agreement on new spending bills with a GOP trifecta in Washington. And he noted at the time that House Republicans were aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline. But the existing dynamics have persisted, even with Republican majorities in both chambers.",
      "Amid the standoff and approaching deadline, Republicans and Democrats have begun blaming each other. While Republicans say Democrats are flirting with a shutdown with their demands, Democrats argue that the GOP majorities would be responsible for any possible shutdown, and they claim Republicans have left the negotiating table.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she's urging Republican leadership to work on new, full-year funding bills and prevent a shutdown with a shorter continuing resolution. She stressed that Democrats \"cannot stand by and accept\" what she called a \"power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to pass a short-term CR immediately to take down the risk of a shutdown so that we can finish our negotiations and write our full-year spending bills, which is our job to do,\" Murray added.",
      "Even if House Republicans can approve the six-month funding measure along party lines, a 60-vote threshold in the Senate means the measure would require the backing of at least seven Democrats to be approved in the upper chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, who has said \"Republicans are responsible for funding the government,\" called for collaboration on a solution.",
      "\"We believe, we've always believed, the only solution is a bipartisan solution,\" Schumer said.",
      "Caitlin Yilek, \n                                                  \n                      Kristin Brown and \n                                                  \n                      Jaala Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Ratcliffe said the pause is \"on the military front and the intelligence front,\" but he did not elaborate further on the scope of the pause.",
      "Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 White House visit was intended to be capped by the signing of a landmark agreement granting the U.S. hundreds of billions in potential benefits from mining Ukraine's minerals agreement. The signing was abruptly scrapped after the meeting descended into finger pointing over Russia and its unprovoked invasion of the country, and whether Zelenskyy had properly thanked the American president.",
      "Zelenskyy had previously repeatedly thanked Mr. Trump and the U.S., and continued to do so afterward. Mr. Trump's top advisers privately shared disbelief about what they viewed as Zelenskyy's badgering of the president in front of cameras.",
      "Zelenskyy has since said he's ready to get back to the negotiating table.",
      "Ratcliffe said in the interview that Mr. Trump made the decision to halt intelligence sharing.",
      "The president \"said 'let's pause.' I want to give you a chance to think about that, and you saw the response, that President Zelenskyy put out a statement saying 'I'm ready for peace, and I want Donald Trump's leadership to bring about that peace,'\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Ratcliffe later added that the U.S. still intends to work with Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia.",
      "\"We'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, as we have to push back on the aggression that's there,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "The Trump administration earlier in the week paused military aid to Ukraine. Although a senior official told CBS News Wednesday that U.S. weapons authorized by former President Biden were still headed toward Ukraine, U.S. European Command appeared to contradict that assertion.",
      "\"We can confirm that U.S. European Command has received an order to pause security assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" U.S. European Command said in a statement. \"U.S. European Command has paused the delivery of those items previously announced as part of Presidential Drawdown Authority packages. Those PDA materials that were in transit have also been paused until further guidance is issued.\"",
      "\"Any materiel paused in theater has been, or will be, moved to secure facilities in accordance with applicable host nation agreements.,\" European Command said.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday night during his\u00a0congressional address that he is \"working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "Intelligence sharing has been crucial for Ukraine in its efforts to strike Russian military targets.",
      "Mr. Trump's confrontational approach with American allies has drawn withering criticism from Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered a response Tuesday to Mr. Trump's address.",
      "\"President Trump loves to say 'peace through strength.' That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave,\" Slotkin said, implying the president who led the U.S. through most of the late-Cold War 1980s would be more supportive of Russia's adversaries than Mr. Trump is.",

      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza, student encampments popped up on a number of college campuses across the country \u2014 including at UCLA and other UC system campuses. Many of the protesters were calling for an end to the war, a U.S. arms embargo on Israel and for their universities to divest from Israel. But in some instances, acts of antisemitism were alleged, and some Jewish students said the encampments and encounters with protesters made them feel unsafe.",

      "Vance made the comments as he, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made a day trip to the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, to highlight the Trump administration's efforts to combat illegal crossings and drug trafficking. Their visit comes a day following Mr. Trump's\u00a0joint address to Congress, in which immigration played a prominent role.",
      "Illegal border crossings at the U.S. southern border\u00a0have plummeted\u00a0since Mr. Trump took office, but the president's recent speeches feature fewer mentions of building a physical border wall than they did during his 2016 campaign and first term.",

So many great artificial intelligence-enabled technologies that allow us, for example \u2014 a camera, not a person, but a camera picks up somebody two miles away who's about to come across the southern border. ... We're using artificial intelligence to make us better at the job of border enforcement, but we've got to make sure that technology is deployed across the entire American southern border. We're going to do it as much as we can, as broadly as we can, because that's how we're going to protect the American people's security.\"",
      "Vance and Hegseth represent the highest-ranking administration officials to visit the southern border since Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "They arrived one day after the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on nearly all imported goods from Mexico, citing Mexico's handling of the situation at the border, a move that sent\u00a0stocks tumbling. A reporter asked Vance what Mexico can do to reverse the tariffs.",
      "\"Well what the president says is we need a sustained commitment from the government of Mexico to take the job of border security seriously,\" Vance responded. \"Fentanyl is the single-largest cause of death among young Americans, and we know that a substantial portion of it is \u2014 the precursors are made in China, they come to Mexico, they're manufactured in Mexico, and brought across the border by the Mexican drug cartels. We want to see fewer Americans dying of these terrible fentanyl overdoses. We're going to apply as much leverage as possible to the Mexican government.\"",
      "The Trump administration has seen success in its efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. In February, Mr. Trump's first full month in office, the White House says illegal border crossings reached the lowest level in at least 25 years. And the administration says more than 50,000 people in the country illegally have been removed from the U.S., a figure that includes migrants with violent criminal histories.",

      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",

      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs plans to slash thousands of employees in the coming months as part of President Trump's initiative to scale back the size of the federal government, according to a memo from the agency's chief of staff.",
      "The memo, sent Tuesday to top Veterans Affairs officials and obtained by CBS News, describes the agency's plans for a reduction-in-force, which is expected to take place in August. The department's goal is to return its workforce to 2019-levels of just under 400,000 employees, a cut of more than 70,000 workers.",
      "Led by Secretary Doug Collins, a former congressman and Iraq War veteran, the VA employed more than 471,000 people as of December, according to the agency's\u00a0workforce dashboard, 27% of whom are veterans.",
      "When CBS News asked who would be laid off, whether probationary workers, doctors, administrative staff or some veterans, the White House said the president \"refuses to accept the VA bureaucracy and bloat that has hindered Veterans' ability to receive timely and quality care.\"",
      "\"By making the VA workforce more efficient, President Trump and Secretary Collins will ensure greater efficiency and transparency for our nation's heroes while preserving the benefits they earned,\" deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement.",
      "Collins said in a video\u00a0posted to social media that the VA is taking a \"pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care, benefits and services to veterans.\"",
      "\"This will be a thorough and thoughtful review based on input from career VA employees, senior executives as well as the top VA leaders,\" he said.",
      "Collins said the cuts to the VA's workforce represent a 15% decrease but pledged there will not be cuts to health care or benefits. The department continues to hire for more than 300,000 \"mission-critical\" positions to protect health care and benefits for VA beneficiaries, he said.",
      "\"The days of kicking the can down the road and measuring VA's progress by how much money it spends and how many people it employs rather than how many veterans it helps are over,\" Collins said.",
      "Tuesday's memo states that the Department of Veterans Affairs, \"in partnership with DOGE leaders, will move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach to identify and eliminate waste, reduce management and bureaucracy, reduce footprint and increase workforce efficiency.\"",
      "Mr. Trump created the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which he said is headed by Elon Musk, to oversee his plan to shrink the size of the federal government and cut spending.",
      "The VA's memo estimates that a portion of the savings stemming from its cuts \"will be reinvested in the veterans we serve and the systems required to support our workforce and executive our mission.\"",
      "The memo is part of the VA's efforts to initiate a department-wide review of its organization and structure in response to an executive order Mr. Trump signed last month that directed agency heads to \"promptly\" make plans to initiate \"large-scale\" reductions in its workforce.",
      "\"This effort will require the entirety of VA staff and organizations to work together in a collaborative fashion, as well as to coordinate actions with DOGE and the administration as a whole, to achieve the desired results,\" the directive states.",
      "It lays out a timeline for implementing this reduction-in-force and reorganization plan, which begins this month and culminates in the terminations before the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.",
      "As part of his government-cutting initiative, Mr. Trump offered the entire federal workforce, which consists of more than 2 million people, a deferred resignation program, under which they could resign from their jobs but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer, far fewer than the 200,000 it expected to take the so-called buyout.",
      "Thousands of probationary employees, generally considered those who have been in their positions for less than a year, have also been terminated. The Office of Personnel Management instructed agency heads in a Jan. 20 memo to identify all employees in their probationary periods and determine whether they should be kept on.",
      "But after a federal judge ruled last week that the mass firings were likely illegal, OPM revised the memo to clarify that it is \"not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",
      "The VA dismissed more than 2,400 employees last month and said there were more than 40,000 probationary workers across the department.",
      "But Democrats have warned that firing thousands of VA employees will have devastating impacts on the nation's veterans, forcing them to wait longer for medical care, to have disability claims adjudicated and to speak to someone at the Veterans Crisis Line.",
      "\"Donald Trump and Elon Musk are escalating their full-scale, no-holds-barred assault on veterans\u2013and putting the health care and benefits they have earned in grave danger,\" Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement. \"It's infuriating that two billionaires think they can fire tens of thousands of people responsible for administering the services and care that over nine million veterans across the country count on. It's flat-out immoral and a breach of the sacred commitment we make to our veterans to take care of them when they return home.\"",
      "Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.",

      "Dellinger's lawyers say allowing the president to fire the special counsel without cause would have a chilling effect on the important duties of the office to protect whistleblowers. The ruling comes as Dellinger is also challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's shakeup of the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the law protecting the special counsel from removal is unconstitutional and unfairly prevents the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "Jackson on Saturday ruled that Dellinger's firing was unlawful and ordered that he remain in his post. But the appeals court lifted Jackson's order blocking his removal while the court considers legal arguments in the case.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing. It investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "After a request from Dellinger's office, a government panel that enforces workers' rights ruled Wednesday that more than 5,000 employees fired by the Trump administration should be put back on the job at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "While the order applies only to the USDA workers, Dellinger released a statement \"calling on all federal agencies to voluntarily and immediately rescind any unlawful terminations of probationary employees.\"",

As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.",
      "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?",
      "This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what, five, five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.",
      "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let's work together and let's truly make America great again. Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.",
      "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.",
      "We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it's back. And two days ago I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.",
      "I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.",
      "We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.",
      "I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.",
      "And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.",
      "What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world, common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they've never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.",
      "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.",
      "That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.",
      "My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.",
      "To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "And to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this, he didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don't want to admit that.",
      "Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.",
      "This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \"Sesame Street\" in the Middle East, it's a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she's involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we're doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.",
      "And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.",
      "Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country, 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.",
      "Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft. And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.",
      "And today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we're gonna balance it.",
      "With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.",
      "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.",
      "Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.",
      "Because we are draining the swamp, it's very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.",
      "And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they're so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.",
      "And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And if you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.",
      "But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.",
      "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. It's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in that market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We've been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.",
      "They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.",
      "Thanks to our America First policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it's got to be much higher than that. I believe they'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world's most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we're not giving them any money.",
      "Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they're building. And many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.",
      "A new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. We'll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.",
      "The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.",
      "And I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.",
      "They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much. No you're not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it's very low, the lowest we've ever been.",
      "Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce.",
      "Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.",
      "And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. There's nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.",
      "But if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.",
      "Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.",
      "Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act. So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.",
      "Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you. The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.",
      "Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.",
      "The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.",
      "Alexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.",
      "With us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.",
      "The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels. Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They're going to stop it.",
      "I have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history. Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it.",
      "And as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.",
      "Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.",
      "They have already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.",
      "This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.",
      "One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended Officer Tiller's service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.",
      "Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York's finest. And we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get him out of here.",
      "I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.",
      "I'm also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.",
      "Joining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.",
      "D.J.'s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.",
      "Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can't even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.",
      "My administration is also working to protect children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you.",
      "Stories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie. And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.",
      "Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.",
      "I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results.",
      "And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.",
      "We're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete \u2014 a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 \u2014 that's good \u2014 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "And Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. That's a hard one to get into. But I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You'll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.",
      "Thank you. Jason, you're going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state of the art \"golden dome\" missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.",
      "Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there. Not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually.",
      "And other place \u2014 they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it's a very, very important. This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.",
      "To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.",
      "We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.",
      "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.",
      "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.",
      "But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.",
      "They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely.",
      "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.",
      "Now we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let's assume we got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it.",
      "But he's already proven \u2014 I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.",
      "And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.",
      "We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.",
      "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.",
      "It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.",
      "America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.",
      "Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.",
      "Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.",
      "And I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.",
      "What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.",
      "I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It's happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.",
      "In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we're going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.",
      "A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven't been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.",
      "I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.",
      "The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \"Pocahontas says yes.\"",
      "2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans. But I want it to stop.",
      "Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.",
      "And we've spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don't. But we're getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.",
      "Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn't happen.",
      "Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"",
      "I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.",
      "Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful?",
      "It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war.",
      "If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.",
      "Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.",
      "But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.",
      "To Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.",
      "As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.",
      "That was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.",
      "Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.",
      "My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.",
      "To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. It was love like Corey's that built our country and it's love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.",
      "I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. Thank you very much.",
      "From the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.",
      "As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it 'til death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.",
      "Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.",
      "Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era. With God's help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.",
      "We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.",
      "And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.",

    "summary": "Read the full text of Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin's prepared remarks for her 2025 Democratic response to Trump's speech to Congress, as released.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin in her brief Democratic response to President Trump's joint address to Congress warned that Mr. Trump, in the his first few weeks of his second presidential term, has taken \"reckless\" approaches to managing the U.S. economy and foreign affairs.",
      "Here's the full text of her remarks, which ran just 10 minutes, compared to Mr. Trump's speech, which was an hour and 40 minutes long:",
      "Hi everyone. I'm Elissa Slotkin. I'm honored to have the opportunity to speak tonight. It's late \u2014 so I promise to be a lot shorter than what you just watched.",
      "I won't take it personally if you've never heard of me. I'm the new senator from the great state of Michigan, where I grew up. I've been in public service my entire life, because I happened to be in New York City on 9/11 when the twin towers came down. Before the smoke cleared, I knew I wanted a life in national security.",
      "I was recruited by the CIA and did three tours in Iraq, alongside the military. In between, I worked at the White House under President Bush and President Obama, two very different leaders who both believed that America is exceptional.",
      "You can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I am tonight. It's a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist all across the United States \u2013 places where people believe that if you work hard, and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids do better.",
      "It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. But it was never a big deal. Because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.",
      "We just went through another fraught election season. Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change. But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy.",
      "So that's what I'm going to lay out tonight.",
      "Because whether you're in Wyandotte or Wichita, most Americans share three core beliefs: That the Middle Class is the engine of our country. That strong national security protects us from harm. And that our democracy, no matter how messy, is unparalleled and worth fighting for.",
      "Let's start with the economy.",
      "Michigan literally invented the Middle Class: the revolutionary idea that you could work at an auto plant and afford the car you were building. That's the American Dream. And in order to expand and protect the Middle Class, we have to do a few, basic things:",
      "We need to bring down the price of things we spend the most money on: Groceries. Housing. Healthcare. Your car.",
      "We need to make more things in America with good-paying, union jobs \u2014 and bring our supply chains back home from places like China.",
      "We need to give American businesses the certainty they need to invest and create the jobs of the future.",
      "And we need a tax system that's fair for people who don't happen to make a billion dollars.",
      "Look, President Trump talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So: do his plans actually help Americans get ahead?",
      "Not even close.",
      "President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America. And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life.",
      "Grocery and home prices are going up, not down \u2014 and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either.",
      "His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber, cars \u2014 and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.",
      "Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care.",
      "Meanwhile, for those keeping score, the national debt is going up, not down. And if he's not careful, he could walk us right into a recession.",
      "And one more thing: In order to pay for his plan, he could very well come after your retirement \u2013 the Social Security, Medicare, and VA benefits you worked your whole life to earn. The President claims he won't, but Elon Musk just called Social Security \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"",
      "While we're on the subject of Elon Musk, is there anyone in America who is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information, and your bank accounts? No oversight. No protections against cyber-attack. No guardrails on what they do with your private data.",
      "We need more efficient government. You want to cut waste, I'll help you do it. But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe.",
      "The mindless firing of people who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from crashing, and conduct the research that finds the cure for cancer \u2014 only to re-hire them two days later? No CEO in America could do that without being summarily fired.",
      "OK, so we've talked about our economic security. How about national security?",
      "Let's start with the border. As someone who spent my whole career protecting our homeland, every country deserves to know who and what is coming across its border. Period. Democrats and Republicans should all be for that.",
      "But securing the border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants. We need a functional system, keyed to the needs of our economy, that allows vetted people to come and work here legally. So I look forward to the President's plan on that.",
      "Because here's the thing: Today's world is deeply interconnected. Migration, cyber threats, AI, environmental destruction, terrorism \u2014 one nation cannot face these issues alone. We need friends in all corners \u2014 and our safety depends on it.",
      "President Trump loves to promise \"peace through strength.\" That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity.",
      "And that scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world. He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth. He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions.",
      "As a Cold War kid, I'm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War.",
      "Donald Trump's actions suggest that, in his heart, he doesn't believe we are an exceptional nation. He clearly doesn't think we should lead the world.",
      "Look, America's not perfect. But I stand with most Americans who believe we are still exceptional. Unparalleled. And I would rather have American leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week.",
      "Because for generations, America has offered something better.",
      "Our security and our prosperity, yes. But our democracy, our very system of government, has been the aspiration of the world. And right now, it's at risk.",
      "It's at risk when a president decides he can pick and choose what rules he wants to follow, when he ignores court orders or the Constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand idly by and just let it happen.",
      "But it's also at risk when the President pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different, and tells certain people they shouldn't be included.",
      "Because America is not just a patch of land between two oceans. We are more than that. Generations have fought and died to secure the fundamental rights that define us. Those rights and the fight for them make us who we are.",
      "We are a nation of strivers. Risk-takers. Innovators. And we are never satisfied.",
      "That is America's superpower.",
      "And look, I've lived and worked in many countries. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government is rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. You can't criticize the guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night.",
      "So as much as we need to make our government more responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself that democracy isn't precious and worth saving.",
      "But how do we actually do that? I know a lot of you have been asking that question.",
      "First, don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever. If previous generations had not fought for democracy, where would we be today?",
      "Second, hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they're voting. Go to town halls and demand they take action. That's as American as apple pie.",
      "Three, organize. Pick just one issue you're passionate about \u2014 and engage. And doom scrolling doesn't count. Join a group that cares about your issue, and act. And if you can't find one, start one.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court split 5-4 in denying the request from the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to halt a lower court order that required the Trump administration to unfreeze nearly $2 billion in foreign-aid funding, clearing the way for the money to flow to groups that have done work for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development overseas.",
      "The decision from the high court ends a pause Chief Justice John Roberts issued last week to allow the high court time to more fully consider a request from the Trump administration to intervene in the ongoing court battle over a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funds.",
      "The chief justice issued a brief administrative last Wednesday \u2014 with a midnight deadline for foreign aid payments approaching \u2014 before the full court acted on President Trump's bid for emergency relief.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in denying the request from the Trump administration, with Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining with the three liberal justices. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented from the denial.",
      "\"Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?\" Alito wrote in a dissent joined by the three other conservative justices. \"The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.\"",
      "Proceedings in the case are ongoing, and the district court is set to hold a hearing on the contractors' request for longer relief Thursday.",
      "Pointing to those ongoing hearings, the court said that the \"district court should clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.\"",
      "The order is among the first the Supreme Court issued as dozens of legal challenges to the president's policies move through the federal courts. The high court has been asked to intervene in one other case so far, arising out of Mr. Trump's removal of the head of the federal agency that oversees whistleblowers. It put off the president's request to allow him to fire that official, special counsel Hampton Dellinger, amid ongoing legal proceedings and has not yet weighed in further.",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The Trump administration came to the high court for emergency relief last week after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered the government to pay all invoices and reimbursement requests to USAID and State Department contractors for work finished before Feb. 13.",
      "Ali is overseeing a challenge to Mr. Trump's 90-day pause on foreign assistance brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive foreign aid funding and argue the freeze is an unconstitutional exercise of presidential power. Last month, he temporarily barred the administration from halting the foreign-assistance funding. Then, after State Department and USAID contractors said last week that they were still not receiving money they were owed, Ali issued an order requiring the Trump administration to comply with his earlier Feb. 13 directive and pay all invoices and funding requests on contracts, grants and other agreements for work finished before that date.",
      "The judge required the government to pay the contractors by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 26.",
      "The Justice Department appealed Ali's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but it declined to intervene after finding that order could not be appealed.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the court to first temporarily halt the district court's order \u2014 pausing last Wednesday night's deadline for the administration to unfreeze foreign aid funds \u2014 and then toss it out altogether.",
      "Harris said that Ali's order was not limited to payments to the nonprofits and companies that brought the case, but was more broad and required it to pay nearly $2 billion on thousands of payment requests.",
      "\"This new order requiring payment of enormous sums of foreign-assistance money in less than 36 hours intrudes on the prerogatives of the Executive Branch,\" she wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"The president's power is at its apex \u2014 and the power of the judiciary is at its nadir \u2014 in matters of foreign affairs.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general said the district court's order prevents the executive branch from not only \"ensuring that foreign-aid payments are consistent with the president's policy priorities, but from conducting even basic diligence to ensure that payments are free from fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Harris reiterated that in seeking emergency relief, the Trump administration wanted to ensure agencies were not at risk of violating a federal court order requiring the foreign aid payments. But restarting the funding required multiple stages and multiple agencies, she said, making compliance with Ali's deadline effectively impossible.",
      "\"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" she said.",
      "But lawyers for the company and nonprofits urged the Supreme Court to deny Mr. Trump's request, in part because it lacks jurisdiction to review a district court order that directed the government to comply with its temporary measure.",
      "\"The government's application, in this posture, amounts to a request for license to continue defying\" a temporary restraining order that requires it to administer USAID and State Department programs established under the law, they argued.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing that Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 executive order and subsequent State Department and USAID memoranda halting foreign aid and ordering contractors to stop work \"plunged\" the organizations into \"financial turmoil\" and forced them to layoff employees. Some are even facing civil and regulatory actions for employment violations, evictions, insolvency and \"physical threats to personnel in conflict areas,\" the lawyers wrote in the Supreme Court filing.",
      "\"Respondents' work advances U.S. interests abroad and improves \u2014 and, in many cases, literally saves \u2014 the lives of millions of people across the globe. In doing so, it helps stop problems like disease and instability overseas before they reach our shores,\" the nonprofits wrote. \"The government's actions have largely brought this work to a halt. With Americans out of work, businesses ruined, food rotting, and critical medical care withheld, the public interest weighs heavily against the government. These are the fruits of the government's actions.\"",
      "They also noted that since Feb. 13, when the district court issued the initial order, the Trump administration \"never once voiced concerns about the feasibility of compliance.\"",
      "In his dissent, Alito wrote that because of the Supreme Court's order, the government must pay the $2 billion at issue \"not because the law requires it, but simply because a district judge so ordered.\"",
      "\"As the nation's highest court, we have a duty to ensure that the power entrusted to federal judges by the Constitution is not abused,\" he wrote. \"Today, the court fails to carry out that responsibility.\"",
      "Alito also took issue with the scope of relief granted by the district court, which required the federal government to pay all invoices and reimbursement requests on all contracts for work completed before the temporary restraining order was put in place.",
      "The lower court, he wrote, \"offered no reason why universal relief to nonparties is appropriate here.\"",
      "\"Today, the court makes a most unfortunate misstep that rewards an act of judicial hubris and imposes a $2 billion penalty on American taxpayers,\" Alito wrote. He added that while the nonprofit organizations and businesses challenging the funding freeze raise \"serious concerns about nonpayment for completed work,\" the relief ordered by the district court is \"too extreme a response.\"",
      "\"A federal court has many tools to address a party's supposed nonfeasance,\" Alito said. \"Self-aggrandizement of its jurisdiction is not one of them.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has signaled it will move in court to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban\u200b, a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's stand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration signaled Tuesday it will move to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban, even in the treatment of pregnant women suffering medical emergencies, a dramatic reversal from the previous administration in a closely watched lawsuit.",
      "The state's largest hospital system said it could be forced to airlift women out of state for care if the federal lawsuit is dismissed. That persuaded a judge to quickly grant a temporary order allowing doctors to keep providing abortions they deem necessary to treat emergencies.",
      "The move to dismiss the lawsuit originally filed by the Biden administration could come as soon as Wednesday, St. Luke's Health System wrote in a court filing, citing communication with the Justice Department.",
      "Dropping the case would be among the new administration's first major moves on abortion. In his first term, President Trump appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "History of legal battle over Idaho abortion ban",
      "In its original lawsuit against Idaho, the Biden administration argued that federal law required doctors to perform abortions in emergency situations if a patient's health or life were at serious risk - even if ending the pregnancy could run afoul of the state's abortion ban, one of the country's most restrictive.",
      "Idaho has pushed back, saying that its state law allows for abortions in life-threatening situations and that the Democratic administration was trying to improperly expand its exceptions.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year and ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations.",
      "The high court did not, however, resolve key legal questions in the case, and it was argued before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. The appeals court hasn't ruled yet.",
      "Idaho Deputy Attorney General Brian Church had urged the court to reject St. Luke's request for a restraining order, saying the hospital system was trying to reinterpret federal law and wrest control from the state legislature now that, \"the United States is abandoning its erroneous interpretation\" that federal law requires emergency abortions.",
      "\"It is now seeking to usurp the role of the Idaho Legislature in setting statewide medical standards of care,\" Church wrote. He said any changes to state policy should come from the ballot box, not the courts.",
      "When might emergency abortions be performed?",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "When Idaho was able to fully enforce its ban during medical emergencies, some Idaho doctors reported that pregnant women were facing delays in care and in some cases being flown to out-of-state hospitals for treatment they would have previously been able to get at home.",
      "\"My colleagues and I lived in constant fear that patients would present in an emergency room who were not stable enough to transfer, yet the medically indicated stabilizing care-termination-could not be provided because it was not yet needed to prevent the patient's death,\" one doctor said in court documents.",
      "While the law does allow for life-saving abortions, it's still impossible to tell exactly when a dire case crosses the line to potentially fatal in the eyes of the law, she wrote.",
      "In another abortion-related case this week, the Trump administration received additional time to make a filing - which would also give it time to change the government's position on the issue. In that case, the states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are seeking to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone. Under Mr. Biden, the government was defending access.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy - often before women realize they're pregnant.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander planned to deploy two small rovers, a rocket-powered \"hopper,\" and use a powerful drill to probe the lunar surface.",
    "story": [
      "Eight days after launch, a second commercially built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but company flight controllers could not immediately confirm the spacecraft's status and orientation.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft, loaded with sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will bounce from site to site near the lander, apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing was uncertain as controllers worked to evaluate telemetry from the spacecraft. But it's engine shut down, its solar arrays began drawing power and the lander's flight computer was in solid contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Assuming all its systems are, in fact, healthy, the solar-powered Athena will have about 10 days to complete its observations and measurements before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reducing its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region, about 100 miles from the south pole in a region NASA is targeting for exploration by astronauts in its Artemis program. But no details were immediately available.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "If all goes well, the Grace hopper will jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander will look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers are on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "And in a coincidence of timing and location, the lander's cameras will photograph a solar eclipse on March 14 when Earth briefly passes in front of the sun and casts its shadow on the moon.",
      "Intuitive Machines' first lander, named Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected while moving a bit sideways, causing it to tip over on its side. The spacecraft still functioned, it was unable to carry out all its planned observations.",
      "Intuitive Machines engineers analyzed telemetry and were able to figure out what went wrong. Athena is equipped with improved software and navigation tools to prevent the same problem from occurring the second time around.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "As if Blue Ghost and Athena were not enough, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",

      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",

      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",

      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander planned to deploy two small rovers, a rocket-powered \"hopper,\" and use a powerful drill to probe the lunar surface.",
    "story": [
      "Eight days after launch, a second commercially built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but company flight controllers could not immediately confirm the spacecraft's status and orientation.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft, loaded with sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will bounce from site to site near the lander, apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing was uncertain as controllers worked to evaluate telemetry from the spacecraft. But it's engine shut down, its solar arrays began drawing power and the lander's flight computer was in solid contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Assuming all its systems are, in fact, healthy, the solar-powered Athena will have about 10 days to complete its observations and measurements before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reducing its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region, about 100 miles from the south pole in a region NASA is targeting for exploration by astronauts in its Artemis program. But no details were immediately available.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "If all goes well, the Grace hopper will jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander will look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers are on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "And in a coincidence of timing and location, the lander's cameras will photograph a solar eclipse on March 14 when Earth briefly passes in front of the sun and casts its shadow on the moon.",
      "Intuitive Machines' first lander, named Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected while moving a bit sideways, causing it to tip over on its side. The spacecraft still functioned, it was unable to carry out all its planned observations.",
      "Intuitive Machines engineers analyzed telemetry and were able to figure out what went wrong. Athena is equipped with improved software and navigation tools to prevent the same problem from occurring the second time around.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "As if Blue Ghost and Athena were not enough, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",

      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

      "Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus could all be visible with clear skies, but not all can be seen by the naked eye, according to Space.com and other sites that track celestial events.",
      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York was expected to have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

      "Authorities planned to pull several vehicles from the Columbia River on Thursday, including a car believed to have belonged to a Portland couple who vanished in 1958 while out for a drive with their three daughters, including two whose bodies washed up at a dam the following year.",
      "The station wagon believed to belong to Ken and Barbara Martin was found last fall by Archer Mayo, a diver who had been looking for the car for seven years, said Mayo's representative, Ian Costello. Mayo pinpointed the likely location and dove several times before finding the car upside down about 50 feet deep, covered in mud, salmon guts, silt and mussel shells, he said.",
      "After matching a partial plate, officials now say they are 99% sure this is the Martins' car, CBS affiliate KOIN-TV reports, and a barge with a crane attached is set to pull the car out of the river.",
      "\"This is a very big development in a case that's been on the back of Portland's mind for 66 years,\" Costello told The Associated Press.",
      "The Portland family's disappearance \u2014 and the mystery surrounding it \u2014 has never been solved. But investigators are now working a significant new tip in the case. https://t.co/X3iMyB6VSb",
      "Officials said that, despite the vehicle sitting upside down with debris on top of it, it's largely intact, KOIN-TV reported.",
      "The Martins took their three daughters on a car ride to the mountains in December 1958 to collect Christmas greenery, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported. They never returned. The bodies of two daughters were found the following year near the Bonneville Dam, but the rest of the family was never located.",
      "The incident was deemed an accident but the discovery of a damaged gun floating to the surface raised questions.",
      "\"It's been a high public interest case,\" Pete Hughes, a Hood River County sheriff's deputy, told the AP. After Mayo provided part of the license plate number and other vehicle identifiers, the sheriff's office and the Columbia Gorge major crimes team, along with the Oregon State Crime Lab, arranged to have the car pulled out, he said.",
      "\"We're not 100% sure it's the car,\" Hughes said. \"It's mostly encased in mud and debris, so we don't know what to expect when we pull it out of the water today.\"",
      "Mayo runs a business that finds things that were lost in the river, like watches and rings, but also helps with the recovery of drowning victims, Costello said. He had been looking for a research vessel that sank in 2017 when he learned about the Martin family, Costello said.",
      "Mayo began digging up material on the family and used modeling to pinpoint the possible location, he said. Mayo found other cars nearby, which will need to come out before the construction company pulls out the station wagon and authorities get answers to a 66-year-old mystery, Costello said.",
      "There is a road near where the cars were found underwater. Authorities haven't said whether they think they might find the remains of any other missing people in any of the other vehicles being pulled from the river.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was sent to lawmakers this week showed that budget goals outlined in a House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on Medicaid, clashing with commitments from Republicans not to cut the popular entitlement program.",
      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hampton Dellinger, the former head of the office that investigates whistleblower retaliation, has dropped his legal challenge to his firing by President Trump from his role as special counsel.",
      "Dellinger's decision to end his legal fight comes hours after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cleared the way for Mr. Trump to terminate him as leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "The D.C. Circuit granted a request from the president to halt a lower court order that blocked Dellinger's firing. The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, sided with the former special counsel in his challenge to his removal and said in a ruling Saturday that he must remain in the role.",
      "Dellinger's decision to walk away from the case cuts off its path to the Supreme Court, which has in a pair of recent decisions reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will.",
      "\"I'm stopping the fight because, yesterday, circuit court judges reviewing the trial court decision in my favor granted the government's request that I be removed from office while the case continues,\" Dellinger wrote in a statement obtained by CBS News. \"This new ruling means that OSC will be run by someone totally beholden to the president for the months that would pass before I could get a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "The ethics watchdog warned that the harm to those dependent on the agency under a future special counsel sympathetic to the Trump administration \"could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.\"",
      "\"I think the circuit judges erred badly because their willingness to sign off on my ouster \u2014 even if presented as possibly temporary \u2014 immediately erases the independence Congress provided for my position, a vital protection that has been accepted as lawful for nearly fifty years. Until now,\" Dellinger said. \"And given the circuit court's adverse ruling, I think my odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.\"",
      "Dellinger continued to take numerous actions under the scope of his former role while the legal battle over his firing played out. He petitioned against the Trump administration's recent mass firings of federal workers\u00a0and, on Tuesday, argued to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative system for federal workers to appeal employment issues, that the Department of Agriculture's firing of over 5,000 probationary workers violated civil service protections.",
      "Dellinger was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in February 2024 to a five-year term. But on Feb. 7, he received an email from the head of the White House's Presidential Personnel Office informing him that \"your position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "Dellinger swiftly challenged his firing in federal district court, alleging that it was unlawful because federal law restricts his removal by the president only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "Soon after, Jackson ordered Dellinger to be reinstated as special counsel while she considered his request for longer relief.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit and then the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute during the earlier stages and greenlight the president's firing of Dellinger. But last month, the high court declined to immediately step into the fight and instead put off a decision while the proceedings before the district court moved forward.",
      "Then, on Saturday, Jackson ruled in favor of Dellinger and rejected the Trump administration's claim that the removal protections laid out in the Civil Service Reform Act were unconstitutional.",
      "The Justice Department again sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit, which granted its request to halt the district court's ruling while it considered the appeal.",
      "\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the unsigned order from the three-judge panel said.",
      "Dellinger's firing came as part of the president's efforts to overhaul the federal government and reduce its size and spending. Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has removed the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, and fired more than a dozen agency watchdogs, actions that have sparked legal challenges.",
      "A different federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, to be reinstated earlier this month. The Justice Department has appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "Thousands of federal workers deemed probationary have been laid off after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., declined to stop the firings, and the White House personnel and budget offices have told agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "A federal judge in California last month\u00a0found that the mass terminations are likely illegal in a separate case brought by labor unions and nonprofit organizations.",
      "Separately, roughly 75,000 workers accepted Mr. Trump's offer to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30 through a \"deferred resignation\" program.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House voted Thursday morning to censure Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas for disrupting President Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.",
      "In a 224 to 198 vote, the House approved a censure resolution against Green, with 10 Democrats joining all Republicans in favor of the move. Two members, including Green, voted present.",
      "Green is the 28th lawmaker in U.S. history to be censured by the House. After the vote, he was ordered to stand in the well of the chamber while the resolution, which called his behavior \"a breach of proper conduct,\" was read aloud.",
      "Minutes into Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday, Green stood and raised his cane in the president's direction and shouted. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, warned Green to take his seat and \"maintain decorum,\" but Green refused. Johnson then directed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "What does it mean to censure a congressman?",
      "Censure is essentially a formal rebuke by the House for some form of misconduct. The punishment usually requires the censured member to stand in front of the dais in the House chamber while the resolution is read by the presiding member \u2014 Johnson, in Green's case. It does not remove the member from office or impose any other penalties, beyond the reputational damage and historical notoriety that accompanies it.",
      "The practice was relatively rare throughout history, but it has become more frequent in recent years. Three other Democrats \u2014\u00a0Adam Schiff\u00a0of California,\u00a0Rashida Tlaib\u00a0of Michigan and\u00a0Jamaal Bowman\u00a0of New York \u2014 were censured in 2023. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar faced the punishment in 2021.",
      "It was most common during the Civil War and Reconstruction, when 13 members were censured for offenses ranging from assault in the Capitol to insulting another member.",
      "Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, who introduced the resolution to censure Green, said the move was not personal and called it a \"difficult step.\"",
      "\"We cannot ignore the willful disruption intended to stop a proceeding,\" Newhouse, who is one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the Capitol riot, said Wednesday. \"Without decorum, without respect, what do we got? What do we have, truly?\"",
      "Newhouse said Green's behavior reflects on all members of Congress and the moment serves as a reminder \"that we all need to raise our level of accountability.\"",
      "\"This is truly a wakeup call for this chamber,\" he said. \"The lack of decorum has reached a new low. When the president of the United States cannot even come into our chamber invited and complete his speech without the interaction that we saw last night, we have to take this action of censure.\"",
      "Before Green spoke during floor debate on the resolution Wednesday, he walked over to Newhouse and shook his hand. Green said he did not hold any ill will toward Johnson, the officers who escorted him out of the president's speech or those who supported his censure.",
      "\"The president indicated that he had a mandate. I said to the president, 'You do not have a mandate to cut Medicaid.' I have constituents who need Medicaid. They will suffer and some will die if they don't get Medicaid,\" Green said of why he heckled Mr. Trump. \"I would do it again.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said Republicans have shown \"selective outrage\" in their condemnation of certain behavior.",
      "\"I can't believe we're having this debate,\" McGovern said Wednesday.",
      "The conservative House Freedom Caucus, however, thought that the censure did not go far enough and is seeking to remove Green from his committee assignment. The group said it will introduce a resolution to strip him of his seat on the House Financial Services Committee, and expects Johnson to bring it up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Green was censured in a bipartisan vote but he needs real consequences to demonstrate that no one gets to disrupt the People's business in lame attempts to derail President Trump's agenda,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the caucus.",

      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a preliminary injunction Thursday that prohibits agencies from halting the flow of federal funds awarded to the states through grants, contracts or other financial assistance based on a memo from the Office of Management and Budget issued during President Trump's first days in office.",
      "\"The executive's categorical freeze of appropriated and obligated funds fundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government,\" McConnell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, wrote. \"The interaction of the three co-equal branches of government is an intricate, delicate, and sophisticated balance \u2014 but it is crucial to our form of constitutional governance. Here, the executive put itself above Congress.\"",
      "The judge said that the OMB order freezing federal funds across the government was \"without regard to Congress's authority to control spending,\" and found that the Trump administration failed to point to any statutory or constitutional authority to impose the government-wide pause.",
      "\"The court is not limiting the executive's discretion or micromanaging the administration of federal funds,\" McConnell wrote. \"Rather, consistent with the Constitution, statutes, and caselaw, the court is simply holding that the executive's discretion to impose its own policy preferences on appropriated funds can be exercised only if it is authorized by the congressionally approved appropriations statutes.\"",
      "He said that the freeze has impacted an array of programs, including Head Start and other childcare initiatives, as well as law enforcement and public safety agencies that rely on the federal dollars.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the coalition of states challenging the freeze, cheered the decision and reiterated that the power of the purse rests with Congress.",
      "\"The Trump administration's illegal funding freeze jeopardized law enforcement funding, essential health care and childcare services, and other critical programs that millions of Americans rely on,\" James said in a statement.",
      "McConnell had issued a temporary order at the end of January that ordered OMB to keep federal assistance flowing. His decision, as well as a February order finding that the Trump administration failed to comply with that directive, has made him a target of Mr. Trump's supporters. He is one of several federal judges who have ruled against the Trump administration at the early stages of cases and faced threats of impeachment by congressional Republicans.",
      "The case before McConnell was brought by the group of states and the District of Columbia in response to the OMB memo issued in late January that called for federal agencies to temporarily pause grants, loans and other federal assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders.",
      "The memo targeted roughly $3 trillion in federal assistance programs.",
      "Shortly after it was issued, OMB walked back the memo amid widespread chaos and confusion over what funds were at risk, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said only the memo was rescinded, and the freeze itself would remain in force.",
      "The states brought their challenge to the OMB funding freeze in late January and argued that the directive violated federal law and the separation of powers.",
      "In his decision, McConnell called OMB's pause on federal assistance \"indiscriminate and unpredictable,\" and he said it is \"disingenuous\" to suggest that the challenged pauses stem from independent agency decisions, instead of the OMB directive.",
      "\"Overall, the OMB directive amounted to a command, not a suggestion, that agency defendants shall execute a categorical, indefinite funding freeze to align funding decisions with the president's priorities,\" the judge wrote.",
      "He also noted that there is no evidence Mr. Trump followed the federal law that lays out the procedures for withholding or cutting money appropriated by Congress, the Impoundment Control Act. The law requires the president to send a special message to Congress detailing the request to rescind or withhold funds, which McConnell said Mr. Trump did not do.",
      "McConnell wrote that the Trump administration \"abruptly froze\" billions of dollars in federal funding for an indefinite period of time.",
      "\"It is difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision \u2014 let alone thoughtful consideration of practical consequences \u2014 when these funding pauses endanger the states' ability to provide vital services, including but not limited to public safety, health care, education, childcare, and transportation infrastructure,\" he said.",
      "Similar challenges are underway in federal district courts across the East Coast. A judge in Washington, D.C., has also barred the Trump administration from pausing the federal aid.",
      "The OMB funding freeze is among an array of actions taken since Mr. Trump returned to office that is part of his plan to shrink the size of the federal government and spending. He created the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to spearhead the effort.

      "\"Hamilton\" had two previous runs at the Kennedy Center, in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term and in 2022 during the Biden administration. It was set for a third session at the performing arts house from March 3 to April 26 next year.",
      "In his announcement, Seller said part of the decision to call off that scheduled run was business-related, as \"it would simply be financially and personally devastating to the hundreds of employees of 'Hamilton' if the new leadership of the Kennedy Center suddenly cancelled or re-negotiated our engagement.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center's governing board voted unanimously last month to elect Mr. Trump as its new chair, soon after the president unveiled plans to replace the center's previous chairman and fill the role himself, while also removing the board of trustees. Sources told CBS News at the time that the White House quickly began filling open spots with administration officials as well as their donors and members of their families, and the Kennedy Center's website ultimately went on to reflect those changes.",
      "Mr. Trump has also made clear his intention to reshape the center's productions and performances, which he views as examples of \"woke culture.\"",
      "In a post on social media, Kennedy Center interim President Richard Grenell called the decision by Seller and Miranda \"a publicity stunt that will backfire.\" He accused Miranda of being \"intolerant of people who don't agree with him politically.\"",
      "The New York Times was first to report the cancellation.",
      "Launched in 1971, the Kennedy Center describes itself as \"the nation's cultural center.\" A \"social credo\" featured on its website says the center's \"objective is to invite art into the lives of all Americans and ensure it represents the cultural diversity of America.\"",

      "\"Hector Rosario cared more about lining his pockets with Bonanno family money and protecting his own interests than his fidelity to the law,\" added Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly. \"He disgracefully compromised the investigative work of his fellow detectives by tipping off a target and lied to federal agents as the walls were closing in on him.\"",
      "For years, prosecutors said the 51-year-old Mineola resident accepted thousands of dollars in payments from Bonanno crime family members.",
      "In exchange, they said, he tipped off a mobster that he was under investigation and looked up the home address of a witness he believed was cooperating with authorities.",
      "Rosario even steered law enforcement raids toward competing gambling parlors and conducted his own fake police bust on a shoe repair shop that served as a front for a rival Genovese crime family operation.",
      "Prosecutors said Rosario was interviewed by FBI agents in 2020 as they investigated Bonanno and Genovese criminal activity in the suburbs east of New York City. But they said he falsely stated he had no information about the Mafia or illegal gambling spots.",
      "Rosario \"allowed himself to be bought by the mob to blatantly lie during a federal investigation into the Bonanno family's illegal gambling operations,\" said Leslie Backschies, acting FBI assistant director in charge of the bureau's New York field office.",
      "Rosario, who was fired from the department in 2022, faces up to five years in prison.",
      "The charge of obstruction of justice carried a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, but Rosario was acquitted after his lawyers argued he wasn't trying to interfere with the federal investigation because he wasn't aware they were looking into his criminal associates, Newsday reported.",
      "Lawyers for Rosario, who remains out on bail, didn't immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Wednesday. Outside court, they said they planned to appeal the conviction, the New York Times reported.",
      "During the trial, Rosario's lawyers argued the case hinged on the unreliable testimony of mobsters now cooperating with prosecutors as they faced their own criminal charges.",

      "Layoffs across the U.S. spiked in February, reaching their highest levels since July 2020, led by widespread firings of government workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",
      "\"When mass layoffs occur, it often leaves remaining staff feeling uneasy and uncertain. The likelihood that many more workers leave voluntarily is high,\" Andrew Challenger, workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The impact of the DOGE cuts haven't yet shown up in official government data, with the Labor Department saying Thursday that the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell by 21,000 to 221,000 for the week ending March 1.",
      "On Friday, the monthly jobs report is expected to show that employers hired 159,000 workers in February, an increase from January's 143,000, according to financial data firm FactSet. The jobless rate is forecast to remain steady at 4%. Some analysts expect layoffs ordered by DOGE to show up in the report in the coming weeks or months.",
      "Other sectors besides the federal government also laid off workers last month, Challenger, Gray found. Retailers cut almost 39,000 jobs, while technology companies cut 14,554 jobs in February, its data shows.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:30:59 -0500",
    "summary": "As Russia bombs Ukraine and Trump pushes Zelenskyy for a \"better deal,\" what will it take to end the war Vladimir Putin started?",
    "story": [
      "The CIA chief confirmed Wednesday that the Trump administration had paused not only the flow\u00a0 of military hardware and financial support to Ukraine, but also vital intelligence gathering that has helped Kyiv anticipate and block incoming missile and drone attacks and effectively target Russia's invading forces. The U.S. military's European Command has also said shipments of arms that were already on their way \u2014 approved by the Biden administration but not yet delivered \u2014 have been paused.",
      "The pause is part of President Trump's abrupt shift in policy on Ukraine, which has seen the White House adopt rhetoric closely aligned with Russia's narrative justifying the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. Trump's bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire deal that could involve significant concessions by Kyiv.",
      "Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington moderated by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House's determination to forge a peace deal.",
      "\"The best way I can describe it is like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across their noses \u2014 we got their attention,\" he said. \"But it's a pause, it's not an end. It's then up to them.\"",
      "Kellogg did not play down the severity of the measure, but said it would not have taken Kyiv by surprise, as \"they were warned this was coming. I told them.\"",
      "\"If you take away support like that, of course it's important,\" said Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army, adding: \"But that's why it was done.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said Vladimir Putin will also have to make concessions to bring about a ceasefire, but those have not been outlined by the White House to date. To even engage in real negotiations on a potential ceasefire agreement, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants Zelenskyy to first give the U.S. access to a major share of Ukraine's mineral resources.",
      "Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential",
      "Zelenskyy's reluctance to sign an economic deal thus far, without clear guarantees that it would come with a commitment from the U.S. to help defend Ukraine from further Russian attack, appeared to enrage Mr. Trump during their\u00a0chaotic Oval Office meeting on Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr. Trump has said himself that he trusts Russia to keep any promises it makes.",
      "Ukraine and America's European allies do not trust Putin's Russia. They note that as the Biden administration warned of Russia's looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions.",
      "\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war. \u2026 We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said about a month before Putin ordered the full-scale invasion, sparking the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II.",
      "Given that recent history, Ukraine's former Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News on Wednesday that any talk of a ceasefire with Russia now, without clear security guarantees from the West, would only give Putin time to regroup and rearm his strained military, and then to reinvade.",
      "Could a Ukrainian \"goodwill gesture\" get Trump on board?",
      "\"We are interested in peace, but we are definitely interested in something that would be guaranteed as a peace, and that would not be used by the Russian Federation as a pause to remobilize and to attack with a tsunami wave over Ukraine and also over European countries,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "After Zelenskyy's dressing-down at the White House, Ukrainian officials \u2014 including Zelenskyy himself \u2014 made it clear they were\u00a0still willing to sign an economic agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"I think the only thing that that deal is potentially going to give us is a discussion on another deal,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, suggesting the economic agreement could serve as a framework, \"and the possibility to engage the United States. \u2026 It's a goodwill gesture with hope that it would translate into the U.S. standing with good against the evil.\"",
      "Russia, Europeans stress, has shown no willingness so far to bend on any of its maximalist demands that Ukraine cede the roughly 20% of its territory currently occupied by Putin's forces. The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to any European peacekeeping forces helping maintain a truce.",
      "Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue",
      "Far from any signs of d\u00e9tente, Russian missiles, bombs and explosive drones have continued falling on Ukraine.",
      "Overnight, the attacks intensified. The eastern city of Krivy Rih, President Zelenskyy's hometown, was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. In a post on social media,\u00a0Zelenskyy said among the damaged buildings was a hotel full of aid workers, including some U.S. and British volunteers. At least 30 people were injured in the attack and four killed, Zelenskyy said, adding that none of those killed were from the U.S. or U.K.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness of the Russian Federation to really engage,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, noting that \"every single night\" Ukraine has faced Russian bombardment. \"That is not something that is showing goodwill of terminating these attacks.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants, what Russia wants",
      "Klympush-Tsintsadze said she hoped an agreement with the Trump administration on minerals \"would give us the possibility, hopefully, to come to a real peace settlement,\" but she cautioned that \"a peace settlement that would not have security provisions on the side of our partners would barely hold with the Russian Federation.\"",
      "\"We've been there before,\" she said, stressing that when Russia first attacked her country 11 years ago, sending in forces to seize the Crimean Peninsula while denying their presence, Moscow claimed it was because \"NATO is expanding,\" but she said at the time Ukraine was \"a totally neutral and non-aligned, non-block country.\"",
      "\"And then all the other lies that the Russian Federation has been coming up with against the Ukrainian people, just because they don't want us to exist. They just want to exterminate us as a nation and as a country, and that's their goal. So, in order for us to reach peace, we would have to see the way to that peace settlement \u2014 which definitely comes through a ceasefire, but not necessarily ends with a ceasefire.\"",
      "Moscow has defended its aggression against Ukraine for more than a decade as a justified reaction to the U.S.-led NATO alliance's territory inching toward Russia's western border. That expansion began in the wake of the communist Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, with former Soviet bloc republics choosing to join the Western alliance to ensure their own security.",
      "Ukraine has expressed interest in joining the NATO alliance for over 20 years, and it has cooperated with NATO as a neutral partner for about that long, but it was not given a clear\u00a0path to membership \u2014 largely due to many members worrying it would be seen as a provocation by Russia \u2014 until after Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In 2023, with the war well underway, then-President Biden said he didn't believe Ukraine was \"ready for membership in NATO,\" adding that he didn't see unanimity among the alliance's members \"about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\"",
      "President Trump's administration has\u00a0ruled out Ukraine joining the alliance and launched unilateral negotiations with Russia. That direct Washington-Moscow dialogue and the lack of any clear demands by Mr. Trump for concessions from Putin have stoked fears in Kyiv and Western European capitals about the White House's commitment to both the NATO alliance and to securing a ceasefire in Ukraine that looks like anything other than humiliation and capitulation for pro-Western Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia insists it wants to end the war it started in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump has said he believes Moscow on that point. Speaking Thursday to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on the Russian narrative, pushed since Mr. Trump engaged in talks with Putin, that Europe, to a greater degree than Washington, is to blame for the conflict's enduring nature.",
      "Peskov said that while the U.S. under Mr. Trump \"is not a friendly country to us at the moment, the United States is a country with which we are now trying to revive and restore our bilateral relations.\"",
      "That is not the case, he made clear, of America's NATO allies in Europe.",
      "Ukraine seeks Europe's support, but hopes the \"United States will stand for democracy\"",
      "Peskov cited remarks by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who called Wednesday for Europe to boost its collective military capabilities and assume more responsibility for the continent's defense \u2014 as President Trump has demanded \u2014 as evidence that \"France is really looking for a continuation of the war.\" He said Macron had suggested that \"France is ready to use its nuclear weapons for security purposes and so on,\" claiming the French leader had issued \"a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe, that is, it is very, very confrontational.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called Macron's remarks \"a threat to Russia,\" while dismissing European suggestions that it is in fact Russia which poses a threat to security on the continent, calling that \"stupid\" and \"delirious nonsense.\"",
      "Macron did reference atomic weapons in his Wednesday night address, saying France's \"deterrent capabilities\" had helped to protect the country \"much more than many of our neighbors\" who do not possess such weapons. He did not mention plans to bolster France's nuclear deterrent specifically, but said that as the Trump administration signals less willingness to come to its European allies' defense, he would consider requests from nations such as Germany to extend \"the protection of our allies on the European continent by our deterrent.\"",
      "As Europe grapples over how to ensure its own defense from future Russian or other threats, Ukrainians will be hoping the continent's leaders move quickly to boost their own defenses against Russia's current, ongoing assault.",
      "France was quick to confirm it would continue sharing its intelligence with Ukraine after the U.S. cutoff, with Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu saying: \"Our intelligence is sovereign. We have intelligence that we allow Ukraine to benefit from.\"",
      "\"We are hoping that all the great... warm political will of the European nations will also, as urgently as possible, will translate in upscaling their defense engagement with Ukraine,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News. \"They've given a lot. They have much more limited capacities than the United States, but we hope that they will be able to invest in Ukrainian defense capacities, that they will be able to upscale their defense production, that they will help us also to procure weaponry in order for us to stay strong while Russia has not given up on their plans to just destroy us.\"",
      "She made it clear that Ukraine would also continue working toward an agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We are to try to get the message across to the American public. I think that this is also very important, and I'm sure that President Trump really cares about the support that he enjoys back in the United States, and I hope that he hears also his citizens [saying] why this is important, and why it is expected that the United States will stand for democracy, will stand for freedoms.\"",

      "Sydney \u2014 New Zealand fired its top diplomat in London after he made a \"deeply disappointing\" remark questioning President Trump's grasp of history, the foreign minister said Thursday. High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Phil Goff questioned whether the U.S. president \"really understands history\" during a panel discussion about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The comments were \"deeply disappointing\", said a spokesman for New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters, adding: \"They do not represent the views of the NZ government and make his position as High Commissioner to London untenable.\"",
      "Peters later said he would have fired Goff if he made the same remarks about any other world leader.",
      "\"It's seriously regrettable,\" Peters told reporters.",
      "Goff, a former foreign minister, compared recent Ukraine peace efforts with the 1938 Munich Agreement \u2014 a pact between European powers that allowed Nazi Germany to annex parts of Czechoslovakia. That policy would later be recognized as the appeasement of a determined aggressor and cited as a dire failure of foreign policy that led to World War II.",

      "\"I was re-reading Churchill's speech to the House of Commons in 1938 after the Munich agreement,\" Goff said at London's Chatham House this week, referencing the famed war-time leader. \"He turned to (then Prime Minister Neville) Chamberlain and said: 'You had the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor yet you will have war'.\"",

      "Authorities in northern Mexico on Wednesday found about 70 pounds of fentanyl hidden inside boxes of sliced cactus, a quintessential Mexican food staple known as nopales.",
      "Mexican law enforcement said they seized some 275,000 pills of the lethal drug in the border state of Sonora, on its way to Arizona, and that they arrested a 29-year-old man. The drugs were valued at about $6.5 million. Authorities found both pills and the drug in powder form.",
      "The seizure took place at a military checkpoint on the Mexican highway connecting the northern states of Sinaloa and Sonora, where officers searched a trailer carrying packets of nopales.",
      "It's just the latest in a cat-and-mouse game between drug smugglers and authorities around the world, as traffickers find increasingly outlandish ways to sneak drugs into other countries. Packets of cocaine and fentanyl have been found tucked away in hair extensions, stowed inside car mufflers, baked into bread, and hidden inside avocados and bananas. Some organizations have used submarines to transport illicit drugs across international borders.",
      "The seizure also comes during a tense moment between Mexico and the United States, as Mexico scrambles to satisfy President Donald Trump's demands to stop the flow of fentanyl and migrants north, which he has used to justify the 25% tariffs he put in place on Tuesday, though migration north and fentanyl overdoses had already sharply dipped before Trump took office. President Trump has made similar demands of Canada, but officials say very little fentanyl flows over that border.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump issued what he called a \"last warning\" to the terrorist group Hamas Wednesday to release all hostages still held in Gaza, directing a sharply worded message after the White House confirmed that he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the group. Mr. Trump, in a statement on his Truth social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was \"sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.\"",
      "\"Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" he said. \"Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!\"",
      "Mr. Trump ended his post with a message he addressed \"directly to the People of Gaza,\" many of whom do not support Hamas, saying: \"A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\"",
      "Hamas said Thursday that the Trump threats \"encourage\" Israel to disregard the ceasefire's terms.",

      "The pointed language from the president came after the White House said Wednesday that U.S. officials have engaged in \"ongoing talks and discussions\" with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with any U.S.-designated terrorist groups. It's the first known direct engagement between the U.S. and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.",
      "Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha came as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire hangs in the balance.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to provide details on the substance of talks, but said Mr. Trump has authorized his envoys to \"talk to anyone.\"",
      "\"Look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what's in the best interest of the American people is something that the president ... believes is a good-faith effort to do what's right for the American people,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt added that Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, and noted that there are \"American lives at stake.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office offered a terse acknowledgement of the U.S.-Hamas talks. \"Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas,\" the prime minister's office said.",

Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a health care investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Mr. Trump's first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world.",
      "The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who wasn't authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The official added that no progress was made but \"the step itself is promising\" and more talks are expected. Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped arrange the talks.",
      "The direct engagement comes as continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. Mr. Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn't agree to terms of a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.",

      "The 500 pound MK-82 bombs released by the KF-16 fighter jets fell outside a firing range and caused civilian damage, the air force said in a statement.",
      "The air force said it will establish a committee to investigate why the accident happened and examine the scale of the civilian damage. It said the fighter jets were taking part in the air force's joint live-fire drills with the army.",
      "The incident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "An unidentified air force official told local reporters a pilot of one of the KF-16s put in a wrong coordinate for a bombing site. An unidentified Defense Ministry official also told reporters more investigation was needed to find out why the second KF-16 also dropped bombs on a civilian area.",
      "The contents of the officials' briefing were shared with foreign media.",
      "The air force apologized and expressed hopes for a speedy recovery of the injured people. It said it will actively offer compensation and take other necessary steps.",

      "In a televised briefing, Pocheon Mayor Paek Young-hyun called the bombings \"awful\" and urged the military to halt drills in the city until it formulates reliable steps that can prevent a recurrence. He said Pocheon, a city of 140,000 people, provides three major firing ranges for the South Korean and U.S. militaries.",

    "story": [
      "Takamatsu Gushiken turns on a headlamp and enters a cave buried in Okinawa's jungle. He gently runs his fingers through the gravel until two pieces of bone emerge. These are from the skulls, he says, of an infant and possibly an adult.",
      "He carefully places them in a ceramic rice bowl and takes a moment to imagine people dying 80 years ago as they hid in this cave during one of the fiercest battles of World War II. His hope is that the dead can be reunited with their families.",
      "The remains of some 1,400 people found on Okinawa sit in storage for possible identification with DNA testing. So far just six have been identified and returned to their families. Volunteer bone hunters and families looking for their loved ones say the government should do more to help.",
      "Gushiken says the bones are silent witnesses to Okinawa's wartime tragedy, carrying a warning to the present generation as Japan ups its defense spending in the face of tensions with China over territorial disputes and Beijing's claim to the nearby self-governing island Taiwan.",
      "\"The best way to honor the war dead is never to allow another war,\" Gushiken says. \"I'm worried about Okinawa's situation now. ... I'm afraid there is a growing risk that Okinawa may become a battlefield again.\"",
      "Island haunted by one of World War II's deadliest battles",
      "On April 1, 1945, U.S. troops landed on Okinawa during their push toward mainland Japan, beginning a battle that lasted until late June and killed about 12,000 Americans and more than 188,000 Japanese, half of them Okinawan civilians. That included students and victims of mass suicides ordered by the Japanese military, historians say.",
      "The fighting ended at Itoman, where Gushiken and other volunteer cave diggers \u2014 or \"gamahuya\" in their native Okinawan language \u2014 have found the remains of what are likely hundreds of people.",
      "Gushiken tries to imagine being in the cave during the fighting. Where would he hide? What would he feel? He makes a guess about the age of the victims, whether they died by gunshot or explosion, and puts details about the bones in a small red notebook.",
      "After the war, Okinawa remained under U.S. occupation until 1972, 20 years longer than most of Japan, and it remains host to a major U.S. military presence to this day. As Japan enjoyed a postwar economic rise, Okinawa's economic, educational and social development lagged behind.",
      "Gushiken says when he was a child growing up in Okinawa's capital, Naha, he would go out hunting bugs and find skulls still wearing helmets.",
      "A slow search for remains",
      "Nearly 80 years after the end of World War II, 1.2 million Japanese war dead are still unaccounted for. That's about half of the 2.4 million Japanese, mostly soldiers, who died during Japan's early 20th century wars.",
      "Thousands of unidentified bones have been sitting in storage for years waiting for testing that could help match them with surviving families.",
      "Gushiken says the government's DNA matching efforts have been too little and too slow.",
      "Of the estimated 188,140 Japanese killed in the Battle of Okinawa, most of their remains had been collected and placed in the national cemetery on the island, the health ministry says. Around 1,400 remains found in recent decades sit in storage. The process of identification has been painfully slow.",
      "It was only in 2003 that the Japanese government started DNA matching after requests from the families of the dead, but tests were limited to the remains found with teeth and manmade artifacts that could provide hints to their identities.",
      "In 2016, Japan enacted a law launching a remains recovery initiative to promote more DNA matching and cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense. A lear later, the government expanded the work to civilians and authorized testing on limb bones.",
      "In all, 1,280 remains of Japanese war-dead, including six on Okinawa, have been identified by DNA tests since 2003, the health ministry said. The remains of around 14,000 people are stored in the ministry mortuary for future testing.",
      "Hundreds of American soldiers remain unaccounted for. Their remains, as well as those of the Koreans mobilized by the Japanese during the war, may yet be found, Gushiken says.",
      "Locating and identifying decades-old remains have become increasingly difficult as families and relatives age, memories fade, artifacts and documents get lost, and the remains deteriorate, says Naoki Tezuka, a health ministry official.",
      "\"The progress has been slow everywhere,\" Tezuka said. \"Ideally, we hope to not just collect the remains but return them to their families.\"",
      "The burden of history",
      "Japan is undertaking an accelerating military buildup, sending more troops and weapons to Okinawa and its outer islands. Many here who have bitter memories of the Japanese army's wartime brutality view the current military buildup with wariness.",
      "Washington and Tokyo see the strong U.S. military presence as a crucial bulwark against China and North Korea, but many Okinawans have long complained about noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops.",
      "Okinawa today is home to more than half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan, with the majority of U.S. military facilities on the small southern island. Tokyo has promised to relocate a U.S. Marine Corps air station that sits in a crowded town after years of friction, but Okinawans remain angry at a plan that would only move it to the island's east coast and may use the soil possibly containing the remains for construction.",
      "Gushiken says the Itoman caves should be protected from development so that younger generations can learn about the war's history, and so searchers like him can complete their work.",
      "Like him, some Okinawans say they fear the lessons of their wartime suffering are being forgotten.",
      "Tomoyuki Kobashigawa's half-sister Michiko was killed soon after she got married. He wants to apply for DNA matching to help find her. \"It's so sad ... If she would have lived, we could have been such good siblings.\"",

      "\"In my family, the word 'mountain' was always forbidden. My mother wants nothing to do with the discovery of this backpack. It's a family that has been broken by grief, by the void,\" Azul, who was just 4 years old when her father died, told AFP.",
      "\"It all seemed crazy to me, and I didn't want to go back to the volcano where he had died. But as the months went by... I started to loosen up, and began thinking: 'Why not?'\"",
      "Inside the backpack, the women found a jacket, a sleeping bag, a water bottle, aspirin, Vitamin C tablets, a set of knives and two rolls of film that had belonged to their father.",

      "The experience also allowed her to learn more about a man she never got a chance to know.",
      "\"My mother never really told us who he was. We knew he had died in the mountains and that he was a mountaineer, but not much more than that. So, it was like rediscovering his story, like saying, wait... we have a father who had a life, a history. So it was like discovering him all over again.\"",
      "Photos taken from other film found inside the same backpack by Cavallaro a year earlier, showed that Vieiro and his partner Leonardo Rabal, 20, had been the first climbers to reach the top of Tupungato from its eastern side \u2014 the most challenging route.",
      "\"That slope has never been scaled again,\" Cavallaro, who lives at the foot of Tupungato in the city of the same name, told AFP.",
      "\"What they (Vieiro and Rabal) accomplished has real historical value in Argentine and international mountaineering,\" she added.",
      "According to the Smithsonian Institution, Tupungato is a Pleistocene stratovolcano capped by a lava dome complex that is about 800,000 years old. There have been no reported eruptions there in modern history, according to Andean Geology, which noted that \"landslide and sector collapse events are likely\" on certain parts of the mountain.",

Last summer, the preserved body of American mountaineer Bill Stampfl \u2014 who disappeared 22 years ago while scaling a snowy peak in Peru \u2014 was found by a climber. A hip pouch contained Stampfl's driving license, a pair of sunglasses, a camera, a voice recorder and two decomposing $20 bills. A gold wedding ring was still on the left hand.",

    "summary": "Egypt unveiled a $53 billion Gaza reconstruction plan with broad backing that would not displace Palestinians. The White House says it ignores reality.",
    "story": [
      "Arab nations, led by Egypt, that have strongly rejected President Trump's proposal for the U.S. to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip and displace its more than 2 million Palestinian residents so the enclave can be turned into a luxury real estate development have offered an alternative plan. Leaders from the 22-nation Arab League attended a summit in Cairo Tuesday and unanimously adopted the Egyptian proposal, which does not foresee any of Gaza's residents being forced to leave during reconstruction.",
      "The Trump administration, along with its close allies in Israel, quickly rejected the plan, with the White House reiterating the president's contention that the destruction wrought on Gaza during Israel's 15-month war with Hamas has made the enclave uninhabitable.",
      "Palestinians who have spoken with CBS News in Gaza have all vehemently rejected any bid to force them from the territory, and the head of the United Nations and some others have suggested that making them leave would amount to ethnic cleansing.",
      "Hamas backed the Arab plan, but has consistently refused to disarm as part of any ceasefire agreement, something Israel considers essential.",
      "Israel and the U.S. reject the Arab Gaza plan",
      "Israel was quick to dismiss the Egyptian-made plan, with the Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv saying in a statement that the proposal, \"continues to rely on the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA \u2014 Both have repeatedly demonstrated corruption, support for terrorism, and failure in resolving the issue.\"",
      "Speaking after the summit on Tuesday, Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty dismissed that stance, telling reporters that \"any talks about rejecting UNRWA or rejecting the PA is just nonsense and cannot be accepted, because this represents international legitimacy, and it should be accepted.\" He accused Israel of violating international laws and U.N. resolutions and said international law must be implemented.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused neighboring Arab nations of having \"used Palestinians as pawns against Israel\" since the country's creation, and its statement reiterated the Netanyahu administration's backing for \"President Trump's idea.\"",
      "The ministry claimed the U.S. president's plan was \"an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will,\" despite Mr. Trump saying they would not be permitted to return to Gaza.",
      "U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement, meanwhile, that the Arab proposal \"does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"",
      "\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"",
      "In his speech, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said he believed the time had come to find a pathway to \"a just and sustainable solution\" to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian crisis, adding: \"I firmly believe that U.S. President Trump possesses the capacity to realize this objective, aligning with our sincere aspirations to bring an end to tensions and hostilities in our region.\"",
      "Next week, at another summit in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and its Arab League partners will seek the backing of other predominantly Islamic countries for their plan. A senior European Union official was at the summit in Cairo on Tuesday, but there has been no statement from the bloc to date offering its clear backing for the Arab proposal.",
      "What is in the Arab proposal to rebuild Gaza?",
      "The Egyptian plan, as explained by Foreign Minister Abdelatty after Tuesday's summit, would involve three phases. The first would focus on urgent relief operations and initial recovery, including building 200,000 temporary housing units in Gaza.",
      "That first phase would take between six months and a year and would cost $3 billion.",
      "The second stage would involve the construction of 200,000 permanent housing units and efforts to reestablish vital infrastructure. That phase is envisioned to take about two years, with a $20 billion price tag.",
      "The final phase would add another 200,000 permanent housing units and more service facilities, including reconstructing ports and an airport over the ensuing two years, requiring roughly $30 billion.",
      "On the key question of who or what would oversee the operations and administer Gaza, which has been ruled by the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas for almost two decades, Egypt's plan calls for an administrative committee comprised of independent Palestinian technocrats to manage the territory for six months, before the Palestinian Authority returns to control Gaza.",
      "The PA currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the other, much larger Palestinian territory. It is widely unpopular among Palestinians and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently ruled out either Hamas or the PA taking control in Gaza.",
      "Abdelatty also said Egypt would train Palestinian security personnel, in Egypt, to return and help maintain security throughout the Gaza Strip, but he didn't say which phase of the proposed plan that would commence during.",
      "The foreign minister acknowledged that before any of this could happen \u2014 even if the plan or some version of it is backed by Israel, which maintains firm control over goods and people entering and exiting Gaza and is currently blocking all aid entry \u2014 there must first be a permanent ceasefire.",
      "A call for international support - and a lot of money",
      "Addressing the summit, el-Sissi called on other nations to back the roughly $53 billion plan \u2014 including financially \u2014 and to participate in a reconstruction conference Egypt is hosting next month.",
      "\"Let us unite to make the channeling of support for this fund a noble goal and a moral imperative,\" el-Sissi said, \"ensuring every Palestinian child and every Palestinian family the right to live in a safe and civilized environment, equal to that of all peoples.\"",
      "In a final statement issued by the summit attendees, the leaders called on the United Nations Security Council to send international peacekeepers \"to contribute to achieving security for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as part of enhancing the political horizon for the establishment of the Palestinian state.\"",
      "The leaders also affirmed \"the vital and irreplaceable role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in carrying out its mandate granted by the United Nations resolution.\"",

      "\"Israel's decision, to block aid to over two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as Ramadan begins, is a reckless act of collective punishment, explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law,\" the U.K.-based charity Oxfam said in a statement. \"Humanitarian aid is not a bargaining chip for applying pressure on parties, but a fundamental right of civilians experiencing urgent need in challenging and life-threatening circumstances.\"",
      "Israel says the aid blockade is aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, which it says was drafted by the Trump administration. Under the proposal, Israel has demanded that Hamas hand over half of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza immediately, which would be a significant change in the terms initially agreed under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was prepared to increase the pressure on Hamas, and he would not rule out cutting off electricity to all of Gaza as part of that pressure campaign.",
      "Human rights and humanitarian, including Oxfam, have accused Israel for months of using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza",
      "Aid group says cutoff will have \"catastrophic result\"",
      "After more than 16 months of war, Gaza's population is entirely dependent on trucked-in food and other aid. Most residents are displaced from their homes, and many need shelter. Fuel is needed to keep hospitals, water pumps, bakeries and telecommunications \u2014 as well as trucks delivering aid \u2014 operating.",
      "An estimated 70% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged during the war, and there is no significant stockpile of tents or other temporary shelters in the enclave for Palestinians to rely on during the aid freeze, according to Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. The aid that came in during the ceasefire's first phase was \"nowhere near enough to address all of the needs,\" she said.",
      "Noting that six infants in Gaza died from hypothermia during the first phase of the ceasefire deal, Low said, \"if it was enough, we wouldn't have had infants dying from exposure because of lack of shelter materials and warm clothes and proper medical equipment to treat them.\"",
      "\"We're trying to figure out, what do we have? What would be the best use of our supply?\" said Jonathan Crickx, chief of communication for UNICEF. \"We never sat on supplies, so it's not like there's a huge amount left to distribute.\"",
      "Crickx predicted a \"catastrophic result\" if the aid freeze continues.",
      "During the ceasefire's first phase, humanitarian agencies rushed in supplies and quickly ramped up their capabilities. Aid workers set up more food kitchens, health centers and water distribution points. With more fuel coming in to power pumps, they were able to double the amount of water drawn from wells, according to the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency, or OCHA.",
      "The U.N. and associated nongovernmental organizations brought in around 100,000 tents as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tried to return to their homes to find them destroyed or too damaged to live in. But progress relied on the flow of aid continuing.",
      "The International Organization for Migration has 22,500 tents sitting in its warehouses in Jordan after supply trucks brought back their undelivered cargo following Israel's entry ban, Karl Baker, the agency's regional crisis coordinator, said.",
      "The International Rescue Committee has 14,771 pounds of medicines and medical supplies waiting to enter Gaza, the delivery of which is now \"highly uncertain,\" said Bob Kitchen, vice president of the Emergencies and Humanitarian Action Department.",
      "\"It's imperative that aid access is now immediately resumed. With humanitarian needs sky high, more aid access is required, not less,\" Kitchen said.",
      "The Medical Aid for Palestinians organization said it has trucks stuck at the border carrying medicine, mattresses and assistive devices for people with disabilities. The organization has some medicine and materials in reserve in Gaza, said MAP spokesperson  Tess Pope, but, \"we don't have stock that we can use during a long closure.\"",
      "The U.N.'s humanitarian office said Tuesday that prices of vegetables and flour had shot up in Gaza after Israel closed the border crossings.",
      "Sayed Mohamed al-Dairi walked through a bustling market in Gaza City just after the cutoff was announced. Prices that had just started to come down during the ceasefire had jumped back up, as sellers hiked the prices of their dwindling wares.",
      "\"The traders are massacring us, the traders are not merciful to us,\" he said. \"In the morning, the price of sugar was five shekels. Ask him now, the price has become 10 shekels.\"",
      "In the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, 2.2 pounds of chicken that had sold for 21 shekels \u2014 around $5.76 \u2014 is now 50 shekels, or about $14. Cooking gas has soared from 90 shekels \u2014 $24.70 \u2014 for 26 pounds to the equivalent of $406.24.",
      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war, Israel cut off all aid to Gaza for two weeks. That move was central to South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice. That took place as Israel launched the most intense phase of its aerial bombardment campaign on Gaza, one of the most aggressive in modern history.",
      "With the the fate of the ceasefire deeply uncertain and aid again frozen, Palestinians fear a repeat of that period.",
      "\"We are afraid that Netanyahu or Trump will launch a war more severe than the previous war,\" said Abeer Obeid, a Palestinian woman from northern Gaza.",
      "\"The crossings are the means by which people obtain the basic necessities of life, why are they closing them,\" she asked. \"For the extension of the truce, they must find any other solution.\"",

      "A placid fishing trip turned \"berserk\" for three New Zealand men when a dolphin weighing more than 900 pounds appeared to fall out of the sky before crash-landing in their small boat.",
      "No one was badly hurt when the 11-foot\u00a0bottlenose dolphin jumped aboard the open-top boat Friday, said Dean Harrison, the owner of the nearly 16-foot vessel.",
      "Harrison and two companions were fishing near the Hole in the Rock, a picturesque spot off the far north coast of New Zealand's North Island, while dolphins frolicked ahead. The men saw a shadow across the bright summer sun and heard an almighty boom \u2014 before chaos unfolded.",
      "\"This one decided to jump on board and say hello,\" Harrison said. \"One minute everything was fine and then just like lightning striking, there's a big dolphin in our boat thrashing around and breaking everything.\"",
      "The creature's flailing snapped \"every single fishing rod we had in the boat\" and severely damaged the bow as the trio clung to the sides of the vessel, said Harrison. One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",
      "But returning the majestic creature to the sea was not an option for the trio due to its size.",
      "\"We looked at the dolphin still alive and breathing and we thought, we've got to start looking after him and figure out what to do,\" Harrison said. \"Because he's stuck in the boat for now, so he's coming along for the ride.\"",
      "The men alerted New Zealand's conservation agency and were directed to a boat ramp an hour away, where workers waited to help the dolphin. On the way, the trio used a hose to keep the creature wet and protected it from the sun using a damp towel depicting players from the All Blacks rugby team.",
      "On shore, members of a local M\u0101ori tribe prayed for the dolphin before it was returned to the ocean using a tractor. Helpers gave the 2-to-3-year-old creature a name: Tohu, which means \"sign\" in the M\u0101ori language.",

    "story": [
      "On the first day of China's pomp-filled National People's Congress, the yearly agenda-setting meeting of the country's rubber-stamp legislature, Beijing announced that it would ramp up its military spending by nearly $250 billion this year, an increase of more than 7%, as it continues to modernize its armed forces. Beijing has been bolstering its military rapidly while pressing, with increasing assertiveness, territorial claims over disputed islands across the South China Sea \u2014 and its claim over the democratically governed island of Taiwan.",
      "China considers Taiwan a renegade province and President Xi Jinping has vowed to reassert Beijing's control over the island for years, by force if necessary. But Taiwan has had vital backup for decades from its biggest international partner, the U.S., which is obligated under domestic American law to provide the island with sufficient means to defend itself from any aggressor.",
      "American military ships and aircraft continually ply the South China Sea's waters and skies around Taiwan, demonstrating, the U.S. military says, the right to free navigation in international space. The freedom of navigation operations have led to some tense encounters in recent years.",

      "Over the past week, Taiwan's government and many of its 23 million people have watched and considered President Trump's aggressive posturing with Ukraine, and his blowup with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last Friday in particular, with unease.",
      "\"I think these events in their totality are deeply unnerving for the people of Taiwan,\" Russell Hsiao, the executive director at the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington, D.C., told CBS News. \"This seeming about-face from the United States in its position of support for Ukraine, I think, raises some doubts among people in Taiwan whether this could potentially happen to them as well, in the heat of a battle against China \u2014 to have its most important and principal security partner essentially pull the rug from underneath them.\"",
      "Taiwan's history with the U.S., and with Trump",
      "Since 1950 \u2014 the year after communist forces won China's civil war against the Nationalists, who then fled to Taiwan and eventually established their own, democratic administration \u2014 the U.S. has sold more than $50 billion worth of weapons to Taipei, including HIMARS rocket systems, F-16 jet fighters and dozens of advanced Abrams battle tanks, according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.",
      "The Taiwanese government has earmarked nearly 2.5% of its 2025 budget, nearly $20 billion, for defense.",
      "But pressure is building from the Trump administration for Taiwan to do more \u2014 similar to the pressure aimed at the United Kingdom and the European Union to bolster their defense spending as the White House seeks to shift the financial burden of supporting Ukraine onto its neighbors, and to get America's NATO allies to contribute more to the alliance.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump's nominee for undersecretary of defense for policy said Taiwan should quadruple its defense spending.",
      "\"I agree with President Trump that they should be [spending] more like 10%, or at least something in that ballpark, really focused on their defense,\" nominee Elbridge Colby told the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te quickly offered a proposal to boost his administration's defense spending to over 3%, a move that would require approval by Taiwan's congress, the Legislative Yuan.",
      "Lai has not spoken directly with Mr. Trump since the American president won reelection in November, but he conveyed his congratulations through Mr. Trump's former national security advisor, Ambassador Robert O'Brien.",
      "That was in stark contrast to Lai's predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen. Mr. Trump, in the weeks just after his first election win in 2016, controversially accepted a congratulatory call from then-Taiwanese President Tsai, breaking decades of U.S. diplomatic protocol that was aimed at keeping relations with Beijing cordial.",
      "Mr. Trump's transition team said at the time that the presidents had spoken about, \"close economic, political, and security ties,\" which angered Beijing.",
      "Up until that point, no U.S. president-elect or sitting president had spoken directly with a Taiwanese leader since 1979, when Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Communist Party-ruled China during a detente with the Nixon administration.",
      "Taiwan may have \"a better hand\" with Trump",
      "While the difference in their personal engagement may be some cause for concern in Taipei, Hsiao, at the Global Taiwan Institute, played down anxiety this week, using Mr. Trump's own framing of geopolitics as a game of cards, after he told Zelenskyy that Ukraine, \"does not have the cards\" to make demands for U.S. security guarantees.",
      "\"Taiwan does have a better hand in terms of what it can offer to the United States in terms of a reciprocal bilateral relationship,\" said Hsiao. \"That remains a robust economic partnership, a strong security relationship and certainly a very critically-important high-tech industry.\"",
      "Despite its size \u2014 Taiwan covers significantly less ground than West Virginia \u2014 the densely populated island is one of the United States' top trade partners. According to U.S. government data, in 2024 it was the seventh biggest, with total estimated trade worth almost $160 billion dollars.",
      "This week, with Ukraine's critical minerals deal with the U.S. hanging in unsigned-limbo, Taiwan's most important, most valuable company, TSMC, which supplies semiconductors to some of the world's biggest companies, including Nvidia, Apple and Google, agreed a new $100 billion deal with Mr. Trump to build five new semiconductor facilities in Arizona.",
      "President Trump said it would \"create thousands of jobs \u2014 many thousands of jobs, and they're high-paying jobs.\"",
      "He said the announcement would bring Taiwan's U.S. semiconductor investment to about $165 billion in total.",
      "\"We're going to produce many chips to support AI progress and to support the smartphones' progress, and we thank President Trump again for his support,\" said TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, standing side-by-side with the president at the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently accused Taiwan of \"stealing\" from the U.S. semiconductor industry, and taking American jobs.",
      "With the agreement signed, Mr. Trump said TSMC would now be immune from the 25% tariffs he is levying across the foreign semiconductor industry.",
      "The deal likely drew a sigh of relief from leaders in Taipei, but with an increasingly pushy, vastly larger and better-armed China less than 100 miles away, they are unlikely to let their guard down.",
      "\"It's very key for Taipei, its leaders, to maintain calm and [be] cool headed with regards to dealing with the Trump administration,\" Hsiao told CBS News. \"But more needs to be done in order to make sure that the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, which is of course the most important security partnership for Taiwan, remains robust and strong under the Trump administration.\"",

      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress that his administration was \"reclaiming\" the Panama Canal.",
      "Mr. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Hong-Kong based group that operates ports near both ends of the Panama Canal. The announcement came after the president alleged Chinese interference with operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. \"reclaiming\" of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.",
      "Mulino,\u00a0in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. \"I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,\" he wrote in the post translated from Spanish. He accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" Mulino continued. CBS News fact-checked the president's remarks to Congress here, reviewing his claims about the Panama Canal in addition to other issues.",
      "Mr. Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Mulino previously denied publicly the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free. The Panamanian leader said in early February that he had told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that he could not set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them, adding at the time that he was surprised the State Department had issued a statement suggesting otherwise.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino around the same time and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal's operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.",
      "\"Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,\" Mulino wrote. \"It doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.\"",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.",
      "The deal has to be approved by Panama's government.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Trump has claimed that Carter \"foolishly\" gave the canal away.",
      "Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was \"the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 10:08:59 -0500",
    "summary": "China's assembled delegates don't care to discuss President Trump's escalating trade war, but the underlying message from Beijing is one of confidence.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 China has responded to President Trump's trade war with defiance, something Mr. Trump is not accustomed to. Now facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the U.S., Beijing has refused to back down \u2014 despite its own economic problems \u2014 and is hitting the U.S. with its own retaliatory tariffs. The air of strength from Beijing was projected clearly on Wednesday at the opening of the National People's Congress.",
      "Thousands of delegates from around the country descended on the Chinese capital's central Tiananmen Square. Dressed in their finery, including some in traditional garments, they came to Beijing for the most important event in China's political calendar. But for the members of China's rubber-stamp legislature, certain topics were clearly off limits when speaking with CBS News.",
      "None of the legislators would respond when asked about any concerns they might have regarding the trade war between the world's two largest economies, or whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping might be able to get over their differences.",
      "Once inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People, the cameras turned to the main event. While the NPC is focused mainly on China's sluggish economy, this year, that discussion and the public proclamations are being overshadowed by geopolitical events \u2014 and the trade war with the U.S. in particular.",
      "President Xi, who's government announced its retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. just one day before the NPC opened, was an observer at the massive gathering on Wednesday. His deputy, Premier Li Qiang, delivered the keynote address.",
      "He announced an ambitious\u00a0GDP growth target of 5% and committed more fiscal resources aimed at stimulating the economy, which is mired in youth unemployment and weak consumer spending, in addition to the lingering fallout from a property crisis.",
      "Li acknowledged the geopolitical tension China is facing, including a reference to the escalating trade war that, at least from public view, shows no signs of abating.",
      "But some of the Chinese delegates in attendance tried to remain hopeful, at least when speaking with CBS News.",
      "\"As this sort of rivalry goes on, there will come a point where we can have a good settlement,\" predicted Delegate Lin Shun-chao, from Hong Kong.",
      "While many Chinese people hope Beijing and Washington will eventually reach a trade deal, it's worth noting how stock markets in both countries have reacted to the tit-for-tat tariffs thus far: Chinese stocks overall are up about 15% from the beginning of the year, while U.S. markets are down almost 2%.",
      "It's another sign \u2014 and perhaps a more telling one than the rhetoric from the podium at the NPC \u2014 of a belief in China that the country's economy will be able to manage whatever Mr. Trump throws at it.",

So, too, is the case with Swift and Lively. If your best friend is 12 months away from trial but is losing another round of PR points every 12 minutes, it might be best to be more local than vocal.

Depositions are commonplace in civil litigation with the parties seeking them only having to establish that the deponent may have relevant information about the case. If Ms. Swift moves to quash the deposition subpoena, Mr. Baldoni will have to demonstrate that she possesses relevant information to the claims or defenses in the case.\"",

      "What is the CAC score?",

      "SOME WINTER VIRUSES COULD TRIGGER HEART COMPLICATIONS, EXPERTS WARN",
      "A calcium score of zero indicates no coronary calcium and places the individual at a very low risk for heart disease. A calcium score greater than 400 indicates a high risk of heart disease, according to Dr. Bradley Serwer, an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals.",
      "\"The CAC score is obtained with a rapid, low-dose CT scan,\" Maryland-based Serwer told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"A high score indicates that you should work with your doctor to reduce your risk.\"",
      "The scan images are processed using specialized computer software, producing what is called an \"Agatston score.\"",
      "\"This computer algorithm evaluates how much calcium is present and calculates a number or score,\" Serwer said.",

      "What to do with the CAC score",
      "The result of the scan can help people take charge of their cardiac conditions, experts say.",
      "\"It\u2019s helpful because it helps identify heart disease early, even if you have no symptoms,\" Segal said. \"This allows for preventive steps, like lifestyle changes or medications, to lower your risk.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "If the CAC score is zero, Segal recommends keeping up good practices and continuing to track risk variables.",
      "\"A low score indicates mild plaque; therefore, lifestyle changes such as improving diet, exercising and lowering cholesterol will help,\" he said. \"A high score indicates that you should work with your doctor to reduce your risk, maybe with statins.\"",

      "Generally, if a CAC score is zero, there is little need to repeat the study for five years, according to Serwer.",
      "For those with an elevated calcium score, there is limited data on the benefit of repeat testing.",
      "\"These patients should discuss their individual case with a trained cardiologist to determine the need for any further testing,\" Serwer advised.",

      "The test is used in combination with other risk factors, such as cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, to determine who needs aggressive medical therapy for primary prevention of heart disease.",
      "\"The earlier we can identify those at higher risk of a heart attack, the earlier we can start them on proven therapies to avoid bad outcomes,\" Serwer said.",
      "\"While we have no data that shows merely performing this test makes you live longer, knowing who we need to treat aggressively and knowing when we can delay or avoid medical therapy is very important.\"",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "In terms of potential risk, Segal compared the CAC scan to a mammography, noting that it\u2019s fast, noninvasive, uses only a small amount of radiation, and does not involve dye injection.",
      "\"It only gauges current calcium, and it cannot identify soft plaque that\u2019s not solidified,\" he noted.",
      "The test can be performed in most radiology departments. For those who are only getting a coronary artery calcium score, there is no preparation required. (iStock)",
      "Segal also cautioned that a zero CAC score does not imply zero risk \u2014 particularly in cases of diabetes or smoking, which are additional risk factors.",
      "\"It's a useful instrument to be coupled with other health evaluations,\" he added.",
      "How to get the test",
      "People interested in getting the CAC score should start by seeing a cardiologist.",

      "A Muslim journalist warned the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that antisemitism has become an \"industry\" in the United States, and called for the Justice Department to investigate the \"malign foreign influence\" behind it.",
      "\"Antisemitism is now an industry. It is an industry that is being perpetuated, unfortunately, by organizations that even have nonprofit status in America \u2013 501(c)(3)s, 501(c)(4)s,\" Asra Nomani, founder of the Pearl Project, told Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. \"And these are organizations that are belying their own mission in order to use as a Trojan horse this opposition to Israel to perpetuate this hate. These young students that we have are the targets of that hate.\"",
      "\"October 7th became their moment. And what has happened is that, unfortunately, pulling our punches and not recognizing their danger in our society serves no one,\" Nomani added. \"It absolutely does not serve our interests of an inclusive society. An actual inclusive society means that we do not allow hate of any kind, and the kind that we have right now against our Jewish community is of epidemic proportions.\"",
      "In her opening statement, Nomani detailed the origin of the Pearl Project, a faculty-student investigative project into the murder of Daniel Pearl. Pearl was Nomani's colleague at The Wall Street Journal when they both reported in Pakistan in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He was kidnapped and killed by Islamic terrorists, who, Nomani asserted, targeted Pearl for being a descendant of Israel.",

I targeted him because he is a son of Israel,'\" Nomani told the committee. \"I am here to report to you that in the 22 years since then, I have been investigating the network that has perpetuated the hate that was targeted against Danny. We have called them agitators today, and we have called them protesters, but they have names. They are from organizations that are in a network that I have numbered now at 1,500. This is not a grassroots organization.\"",

It's a frightening network of the far left and the Islamist groups,\" she said. \"Nobody in this room can support their ideals. Their ideals are against individual liberties and free enterprise.

      "\"It is clear that there is coordination and there must be some common funding,\" Lewin responded.",
      "Lewin said she was not aware of any investigations under the Biden Justice Department to follow the money behind antisemitic activities, and neither was she aware of anyone being indicted over the flow of funding. Cruz again asked whether Lewin was aware of any university or institution having Title VI federal funds cut off because they \"tolerated, welcomed\" or \"had their own officials cheering on\" antisemitism, and the witness said she was not.",

Kathy Hochul has deployed more than 3,000 National Guard soldiers to guard duty in 41 of the state's 42 prison facilities with no firm end date in sight, a situation some close to the situation say is more perilous in some respects than a combat assignment.",
      "\"My husband has done a combat deployment, like he got shot at, and he never once on his combat deployment has he called me up and said, 'Oh my God, I've got to get out of here,'\" one wife of a National Guard soldier told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"But within like, days, he was like, 'I've got to get out of here.'\"",
      "A state Republican legislator whose district includes impacted prisons also shared his concerns with Fox News Digital, complaining that the Guardsmen were thrown into the situation without proper training and fearing that, if injured, they would be ineligible for federal VA benefits.",

      "\"They're not in the Middle East doing that, but I've heard anecdotally, a lot of them saying, \u2018the situation I was in, I felt less threatened when I was deployed overseas than in a prison in New York state,'\" Stec recalled. \"And they know that they're walking among criminals, and a lot of them are very dangerous people, and they're not trained for it.\"",
      "Stec added that the \"orders that they're on are indefinite,\" and he said he is worried because they are \"activated on state orders, which means that if they're injured inside one of these facilities, they are not eligible for care from the VA.\"",

      "In response, hundreds of officers staged a rally in Albany on Tuesday, calling on strikers to \"hold the line.\" It is unclear how many officers have returned to work, but a spokesperson for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision told Fox News Digital that \"Notices of termination and cancellation of insurance have begun to be issued to correction officers who have failed to return to work.\"",

Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims.

They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",

I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Following the breach, DISA launched an internal investigation with help from third-party forensic experts to assess the damage.",
      "It's still unclear how the attack happened. DISA hasn\u2019t confirmed whether phishing, malware or another method was used. However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems.

      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "A new malware strain called FrigidStealer is targeting macOS users as part of a broader campaign involving fake update scams, cybersecurity firm Proofpoint\u00a0reported. FrigidStealer spreads through compromised websites that display deceptive browser update prompts. When users click on these prompts, they unknowingly download a malicious DMG file. Once executed, the malware requests the user\u2019s system password to gain elevated privileges before stealing sensitive information, including browser cookies, password-related files, cryptocurrency data and Apple Notes.",
      "Proofpoint identified two new threat actors behind the operation: TA2726, which functions as a traffic distribution service provider, and TA2727, which delivers FrigidStealer to Mac users. The campaign also deploys malware on Windows and Android devices, signaling a multi-platform attack strategy. The cybersecurity firm assessed with high confidence that TA2726 distributes traffic for other malware campaigns as well. Some operations previously attributed to TA569 have now been reclassified under TA2726 and TA2727.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

FrigidStealer is just the latest reminder that no platform, not even macOS, is immune to the growing sophistication of cybercriminals. With infostealers like Lumma, StealC and Redline already compromising millions of devices and billions of credentials in 2024, the rise of AI-driven attacks and social engineering scams signals a challenging road ahead.",

During the study, the hand was floated in a liquid to minimize friction, and adding elastic or more MuMuTAs would solve the issue of the segments floating back to a neutral position after being flexed. However, by bundling the tissue together, they overcame a major hurdle in scaling up biohybrid devices. Previously, such devices were limited to about a centimeter in size.",

      "The Zacks Investment breach first came to light in late January 2025 when a hacker known as \"Jurak\" claimed on BreachForums that they had gained access to Zacks' systems as early as June 2024.",
      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",
      "This is not the first time Zacks has suffered a breach. Previous incidents include a 2022 attack that compromised an older Zacks Elite product database from 1999 to 2005, as noted on Zacks' own breach disclosure page.",

      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What data got compromised",
      "The Zacks Investment data breach, confirmed by Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), exposed a range of sensitive user information, putting those affected at risk. The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make.

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

      "\"Bryan C. Kohberger, by and through his attorneys of record\u2026 hereby moves this Court to strike the death penalty as a sentencing option in his case because Mr. Kohberger\u2019s autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reduces his culpability, negates the retributive and deterrent purposes of capital punishment, and exposes him to the unacceptable risk that he will be wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death,\" Anne Taylor wrote in a newly unsealed, 28-page court filing.",

      "Arab leaders convened in Cairo on Tuesday for an emergency summit aimed at presenting a counterproposal to President Donald Trump's Gaza plan. The summit was held to discuss Egypt\u2019s $53 billion comprehensive reconstruction blueprint for Gaza.",
      "Before Trump proposed resettling Gazans outside the enclave, Egypt and other Arab states had shown little interest in Gaza's reconstruction. However, given that Egypt has ruled out accepting displaced Palestinians for \"national security\" reasons, it now finds itself compelled to devise its own plan.",
      "With a $53 billion price tag, the plan is positioned as an alternative to Trump\u2019s vision, and key details have already been shared by Arab media outlets. While Egypt proposes a temporary committee to manage Gaza for six months, Palestinians have made it clear that they will not accept any governing body that isn't Palestinian or any foreign forces within Gaza. The plan is projected to take at least four and a half years.",

      "The Egyptian plan is divided into two phases: the first, lasting two years and costing around $20 billion, and the second, spanning two and a half years with a $30 billion allocation. The funds will primarily go toward rebuilding residential areas devastated by conflict.",
      "Importantly, the plan does not call for the displacement of Gaza's residents, as Trump\u2019s proposal does, and stresses the importance of Palestinian-led reconstruction efforts, and that the Palestinian Authority will collaborate with Egypt and Jordan to train a police force for Gaza. But Hamas has already rejected the plan, and the Palestinian Authority has made it clear that it will not engage in reconstruction efforts as long as Hamas maintains control.",
      "\"The Saudis will fund Gaza if there\u2019s a path to a Palestinian state and Hamas is gone,\" Ghaith Al-Omari, senior fellow at the Washington Institute and former executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine told Fox News Digital, \"Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar want something from the Israelis in return, whether it's an end to the war or security agreements. They\u2019ll insist on a role for the Palestinian Authority, even if symbolic, for diplomatic reasons. The question is whether the current Israeli government can meet these demands.\"",

      "\"A militarized Hamas cannot remain in Gaza \u2013 the strip must be demilitarized, and Hamas must no longer be in control. The Emiratis are even more extreme on this issue,\" Danny Zaken, a senior commentator for Israel Hayom newspaper, told Fox News Digital, \"The final draft of the Egyptian plan will avoid directly addressing Hamas. Instead of stating that Hamas will be removed and disarmed, it will say that \u2018qualified Palestinian security forces will maintain order with Egyptian backing.\u2019 This approach aims for unanimous approval without addressing Hamas\u2019 fate, but the reality is that it has no practical validity, because in that case the plan has no financial backing,\" he explained.",
      "Al-Omari observed, \"Arab League summits tend to be a lot of posturing. Who\u2019s going to take care of security? The PA can\u2019t handle that \u2013 they\u2019re too weak. No Arab country wants to send troops to Gaza, but they\u2019re also under pressure from the U.S. to contribute.\"",
      "An Egyptian diplomatic source told Fox News Digital that Egyptian construction firms are ready to begin work, but the real challenge is political. \"Egyptian construction companies are very capable, and they can rebuild Gaza in three years \u2013 if there is political will, mainly from Israel and the U.S.,\" the source said.",

      "While Egypt is eager to lead the reconstruction process, its ambitions have created friction with key Gulf states, which are expected to finance much of the effort. Zaken, noted, \"The Saudis are concerned because the Egyptians want to control the entire process: Who gets the money, who oversees the reconstruction, who the contractors are for demolition and rebuilding? And even new housing and hotels. The other partners worry about corruption in the process.\"",
      "A former U.S. foreign service official warned Fox News Digital that Egypt\u2019s ability to manage such funds is a concern. \"The Gulf, which is expected to pay for it, is sick and tired of Egyptian corruption. If they fund the reconstruction, they will demand major oversight to ensure the money doesn\u2019t get lost in Egypt\u2019s power structure,\" the source said.",

      "Meanwhile, Jordan, which has played a key diplomatic role, has managed to avoid direct involvement in the reconstruction debate. Following King Abdullah\u2019s meeting with Trump, Jordanian officials felt that the pressure had shifted to Egypt and other Arab states. \"The Jordanians were very happy with the outcome of the meeting with Trump. They feel that the pressure to accept [a] million Gazans is off them,\" Al-Omari said.",
      "At the same time, the broader political future of Gaza remains uncertain. Al-Omari noted that despite the ongoing reconstruction discussions, the primary concern for Arab leaders is how to navigate Trump\u2019s unpredictable stance on Gaza. \"Frankly, the main thinking in Arab governments right now is how to engage in a covert process with Trump to walk him back from this. No one expects immediate results, but they do hope that this will move Trump away from the idea of depopulating Gaza,\" he said.",

      "\"That\u2019s completely out the window now,\" said Nik Nanos, founder and chief data scientist of the Canadian polling firm, who also believes Trudeau\u2019s imminent departure and Trump\u2019s rhetoric against Canada have contributed to the Liberals\u2019 bump in the polls.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency abandoned some of its plans to slash contract spending for veterans\u2019 health care services this week after a revolt by front-line Veterans Health Administration employees who contended many of the cuts would imperil safety at the agency\u2019s almost 1,400 hospitals and clinics.",
      "What had been a list of 875 VA contracts scheduled for termination a little over a week ago has now become 585 canceled contracts, the VA said Monday.

      "The list of contracts still on the chopping block has not been made public, and the VA declined to provide it. But VA employees have identified 200 of the remaining scheduled cancellations to NBC News, and some of them appear to be central to patient safety, those employees say.",
      "For example, the revised list of killed contracts includes those covering sterility certification for VA hospital pharmacy operations, facility air quality and safety testing to prevent transmission of infections, and sterile processing services to decontaminate equipment and medical instruments.\u00a0Also on the list: contracts providing required certification and accreditation for stroke centers and follow-up care for cancer patients.",
      "Another contract that remains scheduled for cancellation supports the\u00a0National Center for PTSD, a VA entity that is\u00a0the world\u2019s leading research and educational center on post-traumatic stress disorder. Also terminated is a contract that would continue a long-established technology upgrade of the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s electronic health records system.",
      "The VA said it could not comment on the contracts unless NBC News identified\u00a0them by contract\u00a0name and contract number. NBC News declined to do so out of concern that it could reveal the identity of its sources.",
      "The spokesman for DOGE did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "On Wednesday, the VA announced that it was laying off 80,000 workers in an agencywide reorganization scheduled for August. The aim is to reduce its workforce to its 2019 level of 400,000, the memo to employees said. The agency\u00a0dismissed\u00a02,400 probationary employees in February.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the ranking member of the\u00a0Veterans Affairs Committee, said he learned about the new contract cancellations from NBC News. He characterized them as a \u201creckless\u201d move by Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, cancelling these contracts will cause harm to veterans and VA care and benefits,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement. \u201cAnd it is completely unacceptable there has been no transparency, accountability, or consultation surrounding these contracts. By intentionally concealing from Congress the full list of contracts cancelled, Collins makes clear his intentions to use these terminated services as numbers for his press release, with zero regard for veterans.\u201d",
      "'Most stringent standards'",
      "It has been a harrowing few weeks for VA employees charged with operating the nation\u2019s largest health care system, according to five agency officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are afraid of retaliation. In recent days, several VA employees have been suspended indefinitely after they were accused of sharing nonpublic information about the DOGE contract terminations, according to a VA official and a congressional staffer in touch with the employees.",
      "The VA spokesman declined to comment on whether employees have been suspended.",
      "The recent tumult inside the VA began roughly 10 days ago when employees received a list of 875 contracts DOGE apparently determined were wasteful. To the astonishment of some Veterans Health Administration employees, many of the contracts were crucial to the safe operation of VA facilities. Including them on the list suggested that DOGE had done little analysis of the contracts\u2019 functions, four current employees told NBC News.",
      "For example, one type of canceled contract on the initial list paid for the safety monitoring of hospital\u00a0radiation equipment used for X-rays and MRIs and to treat and screen veterans for cancer.",
      "The monitoring, required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is conducted at least annually by experts known as\u00a0medical physicists\u00a0to ensure that the equipment is safe for patients and that it delivers the appropriate amounts of radiation. The machinery must also be checked to ensure employees using it are not exposed to dangerous radiation levels.",
      "Hospitals are subject to regular audits and inspections and, if radiation equipment is found to be in violation, it must be rectified within a certain period. Without contractors available to resolve the problem quickly, the hospital departments using the equipment would have to shut down, the VA officials said. The hospitals would most likely have to close, as well, a VA official said, because \u201cyou cannot have a hospital that does not have a radiology department.\u201d",
      "Last week, after they received the list of 875 terminated contracts, employees in the nationwide Veterans Health Administration regional care systems, many of them veterans themselves,\u00a0objected and argued for reinstatement of many of the contracts, the VA officials told NBC News. The Veterans Health Administration serves roughly 9 million enrolled veterans in its medical centers and outpatient clinics every year.",
      "A VA official said that when he saw the initial list, he concluded:\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re trying to push veterans into community care,\u201d referring to services provided outside VA hospitals and clinics. \u201cAnd to do that, they\u2019re doing everything they can to make the VA mission fail.\u201d",
      "Amid the backlash last week, the VA paused its planned cuts. Then, on Monday, it announced the contract termination list had fallen by one-third, to 585 contracts. Medical physicists charged with monitoring facility radiation equipment were no longer on the canceled list.",
      "Among the contracts still scheduled to be terminated at the VA is one covering the certification of areas and equipment in VA pharmacies used to combine multiple drugs, known as compounded medicines. Such certifications are at the heart of patient safety, because compounded medicines, which patients with cancer and other maladies use, must be made in special settings.",
      "According to\u00a0The Joint Commission, the country\u2019s oldest and largest standards-setting and accrediting body in health care, certifying compounding areas ensures that pharmacies \u201cmeet the most stringent standards in safety and reliability.\u201d",
      "The terminated list also includes contracts for a practice crucial to preventing infection in hospitals: the sterilization of medical devices and instruments needed during surgery.",
      "Other contracts set for termination handle air quality testing, the documents show. Certain states, such as California and Massachusetts, have standards for air quality that must be met in health care facilities to reduce the transmission of hospital infections. The Joint Commission has its own airflow standards, and to meet them, facility equipment must be tested to ensure high ventilation rates.",
      "Although the revised list of contracts reinstated medical physicists, who are the radiology experts who monitor equipment for excessive or inappropriate levels of radiation, the documents reviewed by NBC News show the termination of multiple contracts for radiation safety officers, a similar role. Those contractors ensure that a facility\u2019s radiation safety program complies with regulations.",
      "As for the health records upgrade and the contracts for the National Center for PTSD, which provides information about the disorder for veterans and their families, as well as helps find providers, both appear to be viewed as \"non-mission critical.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has talked with aides about favoring NATO members that spend a set percentage of their GDP on defense, sources told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is considering a major change\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S.\u2019 participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three current and former senior U.S. officials\u00a0and one congressional official.",
      "Trump has discussed with aides the possibility of calibrating America\u2019s NATO engagement in a way that favors members of the alliance that spend a set percentage of their gross domestic\u00a0product\u00a0on defense, the officials said.",
      "As part of the potential policy shift, the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold, the officials said. If\u00a0Trump does make that change, it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet of the alliance known as Article 5,\u00a0which says that an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all\u00a0of them.",
      "The president is similarly considering a policy change in which the U.S. may choose to prioritize military exercises with NATO members that are spending the set percentage of their GDPs on defense, the officials said. His administration has already signaled to America\u2019s European allies that the U.S. could reduce its military presence in Europe, and one option now under consideration is to reposition some U.S. troops in the region so they are focused in or around NATO countries that have scaled their defense spending to meet the specific percentage of their GDPs, the officials said.",
      "Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S. engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a written statement, \u201cPresident Trump is committed to NATO and Article V.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense and a senior senator on the Foreign Relations panel, said Trump\u2019s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, \u201cgave very reassuring answers\u201d on the administration\u2019s commitment to NATO and Article 5.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the current NATO member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts an added burden on the U.S.",
      "NATO countries agreed more than a decade ago to set the spending goal for each of them at 2% of GDP. But Trump has pushed to increase that percentage. Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said in January after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "According to NATO\u2019s most recent statistics, last year 23 NATO members\u2019 defense spending exceeded 2% of their GDP. Five of those nations\u00a0\u2014 Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. \u2014 spent more than 3% on defense.\u00a0Poland\u00a0had the highest percentage,\u00a0dedicating 4.12% of its GDP to defense.",
      "The potential shift in how the U.S. participates in NATO comes as Trump is pushing European allies to do more to aid Ukraine\u00a0in its war with Russia\u00a0and to play a major role in maintaining peace in the country if a\u00a0deal to end the war is reached.",
      "\u201cI was contacted by several European ambassadors concerned about rumors that Trump might make some negative announcement about NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday. Trump didn\u2019t announce anything at his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, but Coons said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not given pause by everything about President Trump\u2019s statements and actions on foreign policy, you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d",
      "Trump threatened to withdraw\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0from NATO during his first term and has questioned the merits of Article\u00a05\u00a0for the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0The article was designed to protect European nations from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It has been triggered just once, after the\u00a09/11\u00a0attacks on the U.S.",
      "Ukraine has sought NATO membership, but the Trump administration has said that would not be part of any negotiated peace deal."

      "Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency abandoned some of its plans to slash contract spending for veterans\u2019 health care services this week after a revolt by front-line Veterans Health Administration employees who contended many of the cuts would imperil safety at the agency\u2019s almost 1,400 hospitals and clinics.",
      "What had been a list of 875 VA contracts scheduled for termination a little over a week ago has now become 585 canceled contracts, the VA said Monday. The about-face is a rare public retreat by the so-called efficiency operation known as DOGE, which has come under fire for moving to ax crucial government services and overstating the value of some of its savings to taxpayers.",
      "In its announcement reducing the number of contracts to be canceled, the VA said that the terminations \u201cwill not negatively affect Veteran care, benefits or services\u201d and that they \u201cwere identified through a deliberative, multi-level review.\u201d The agency acknowledged that some of the canceled contracts had already been fully paid for.",
      "The list of contracts still on the chopping block has not been made public, and the VA declined to provide it. But VA employees have identified 200 of the remaining scheduled cancellations to NBC News, and some of them appear to be central to patient safety, those employees say.",
      "For example, the revised list of killed contracts includes those covering sterility certification for VA hospital pharmacy operations, facility air quality and safety testing to prevent transmission of infections, and sterile processing services to decontaminate equipment and medical instruments.\u00a0Also on the list: contracts providing required certification and accreditation for stroke centers and follow-up care for cancer patients.",
      "Another contract that remains scheduled for cancellation supports the\u00a0National Center for PTSD, a VA entity that is\u00a0the world\u2019s leading research and educational center on post-traumatic stress disorder. Also terminated is a contract that would continue a long-established technology upgrade of the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s electronic health records system.",

    "summary": "RAINN and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center drew backlash from allies for removing content about transgender people from their websites.",
    "story": [
      "For the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, the choice was impossible: erase mentions of transgender people from its website or risk the ire of the Trump administration, which has required that groups receiving federal funding end diversity, equity and inclusion programs and recognize only two sexes.",
      "So the group reluctantly took down references to transgender people from its website, including mentions of services for transgender veterans and LGBTQ-focused book recommendations.",
      "It did so just as the nation\u2019s largest group fighting sexual violence, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), also pulled down pages referring to transgender people.",
      "The backlash was swift. Local and national organizations that support women and sexual assault victims issued rare public criticisms of their allies, accusing them of abandoning trans victims, who face high rates of sexual violence, and urged other groups to \u201chold the line.\u201d",
      "The conflict exposed a sharp divide in the ecosystem of nonprofit groups that work to address sexual violence, many of which rely heavily on government funding to operate. Leaders of such groups say they feel pressured to choose between protecting grants they need to serve people in crisis and taking a stand for vulnerable members of their constituency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s thrown a lot of chaos into a sector that\u2019s already \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 grossly underfunded,\u201d said Emily Miles, executive director of the NYC Alliance Against Sexual Assault. \u201cI can have empathy for difficult decisions organizations are having to make right now while also holding them to account for survivors who need their assistance.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the executive orders were signed, the Office of Management and Budget instructed the Justice Department, among other agencies, to review its programs for compliance. A spreadsheet provided by the OMB\u00a0included roughly two dozen Justice Department programs that dole out more than half a billion dollars combined to combat sexual violence.",
      "That, along with reports that the Trump administration is using keywords that include \u201csex,\u201d \u201ctrauma\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d to identify science grants to cut, worried many nonprofit groups.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields did not address questions about how the groups were responding to the executive orders but reiterated the administration\u2019s commitment to same-sex services for victims of sexual violence.",
      "In recent weeks, the Justice Department\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women has removed all grant applications and has not explained why. The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cOn the horizon, that\u2019s the big question mark about what\u2019s going to happen to those funding opportunities,\u201d Miles said.",
      "Yolanda Edrington, CEO of Respect Together, the umbrella organization of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center and the Pennsylvania Coalition to Advance Respect, said more than 90% of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center\u2019s funding comes from state and federal government grants. Losing it could mean laying off staff members and not being able to provide services like legal counseling for victims.",
      "But after it removed references to LGBTQ victims, the organization quickly reversed course, restored them and issued a public apology Feb. 20, calling it \u201ca fear-based decision to the executive orders.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Edrington said the group was wrong to cave in to the administration so quickly. \u201cWe know exactly who we are and who we should represent, and we failed at that. I don\u2019t want to mince words with that at all,\u201d she said.",
      "Edrington said she recently participated in a call with nearly two dozen other nonprofit anti-violence groups in which they discussed \u201cwhich one of us can take the heat and be the loudest\u201d while withstanding a potential loss of federal funding. They did not come to a decision.",
      "Emily May, a co-founder and the president of Right To Be, a nonprofit anti-harassment organization, said her group relies on the federal government for at least 10% of its funding. It provides workplace culture training to several federal agencies and has already received word that two of them are unlikely to renew their contracts.",
      "\u201cEverybody is incredibly aware everything you say or do can put a target on your back, and that can be incredibly scary,\u201d May said. \u201cBut the target is already on our back.\u201d",
      "Feeling that pressure, RAINN \u2014 which runs federally funded sexual assault hotlines, among other programs \u2014 removed its inclusion policy and pages expressing support for LGBTQ survivors. It also sent an email to everyone in its speakers bureau Feb. 7 saying it had unpublished victims\u2019 stories, along with videos and social posts, in part to comply with federal guidance. The organization would be in touch with victims, it added, to see whether they \u201cwould like to update and republish\u201d their stories.",
      "Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, a RAINN spokeswoman, said federal agencies instructed the organization to change its website. She declined to offer specifics or identify which government offices advised it to remove LGBTQ-related content.",
      "For Ethan Levine, an activist and member of RAINN\u2019s speakers bureau, who is transgender, RAINN's removal of the survivors' stories was insulting. \u201cI felt cast aside,\u201d he said. He felt the group was asking him to update his story \u201cto make it more palatable in this moment\u201d and hoped that RAINN would follow the National Sexual Violence Resource Center\u2019s lead and reverse its decision \u2014 or at least explain it further.",
      "\u201cIf the biggest sexual assault organization in the U.S. is not willing to stand up, then what message does that send to smaller organizations?\u201d he asked.",
      "Simmons Kaleba said RAINN's mission has not changed. \u201cAny survivor can come to us as their authentic selves, and they\u2019ll be safely received \u2014 so we do support every survivor of sexual assault,\u201d she said. \u201cThat said, not everyone will support what we\u2019ve had to do to continue our crisis services, and that\u2019s a very reasonable reaction.\u201d",

      "Sexual Violence Center, a Minnesota-based organization supporting rape victims, condemned RAINN in a statement last week and urged it to use its \u201cconsiderable influence\u201d to push back.

      "For Miles, of the NYC Alliance, RAINN\u2019s decision to quickly comply with the Trump administration\u2019s guidance put pressure on smaller groups to follow suit.",

      "Last month, that aching search came to an end when Aziz was found safe about 1,400 miles away in Douglas County, Colorado.",
      "His mother, Rabia Khalid, and her husband, Elliot Blake Bourgeois, were arrested on felony charges, including kidnapping.",
      "Here's what we know about his disappearance and recovery:",
      "When did Aziz go missing?",
      "Abdul Aziz Khan was 7 years old when he was allegedly abducted by his mother, Rabia Khalid, on Nov. 27, 2017 from their home in Atlanta.",
      "His father, Abdul Khan, and mother, Khalid, had separated in 2014 and shared custody of the child.",
      "After the separation, Khalid had moved with her son from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Atlanta for a new job. Abdul regularly traveled to Atlanta to see his son and brought him back to New Orleans for family visits, according to The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Khalid and Khan were in the midst of a contentious custody battle in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, around the time of Aziz's disappearance. According to the U.S. Marshals, Khalid allegedly was refusing to cooperate with directives from the court.",
      "In the custody case, Khalid had made some \"criminal allegations\" against Aziz's father, Douglas County Sheriff Darren Weekly told reporters in a news conference Wednesday. He said that those allegations have been dismissed.",
      "\"When it appeared that the father was going to get full custody, that is when the mother left with the child,\" Weekly said.",
      "Around Thanksgiving 2017, Khalid and her new husband, Elliot Blake Bourgeois, sold their vehicles in the Atlanta area and disappeared.",
      "In December 2019, a felony warrant was issued by the Kenner, Louisiana, police department for Khalid for kidnapping her son after efforts to find Aziz proved unsuccessful.\u00a0The U.S. Marshals picked up the case in 2020.",
      "Aziz's story was the subject of a Netflix \"Unsolved Mysteries\" episode in 2022.",
      "How was Aziz found?",
      "Aziz was found on Feb. 23 in Douglas County, Colorado.",
      "Deputies had been dispatched to a home in Highlands Ranch to investigate a burglary in progress. The owner of a home that was vacant and listed for sale reported seeing a woman and a man illegally enter the property, captured by monitoring security cameras.",
      "Deputies arrived and found two children in a parked vehicle in the driveway. Shortly afterward, the man and woman exited the home claiming to be associated with a realtor.",
      "However, deputies found \u201cinconsistencies\u201d with the duo\u2019s story. Authorities described the pair as \"very nervous,\" said they had given fake identities and \"stories that didn't add up.\"",
      "After about five hours, their stories unraveled.",
      "Angeline Hartman with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children told NBC News that the sheriff\u2019s office brought a portable fingerprint scanner to the scene to ultimately identify Khalid.",
      "Deputies then realized Khalid had an active warrant for kidnapping and identified the older child at the scene as Aziz.",
      "Khalid and Elliot Blake Bourgeois, 42, were arrested and booked into the Douglas County Jail on a slew of charges, including second-degree kidnapping, forgery, identity theft, providing false information to authorities and trespassing. Bond was set at $1 million each.",
      "It's not clear why they ended up in Colorado nor how long they had been in the state.",
      "Police did not disclose the relationship with the other child.",
      "Weekly said that, as investigators were talking to the couple, the kids went to a neighbor's house where they got food and watched TV.",
      "The reuniting process",
      "Sheriff Weekly said he met with Aziz's paternal family for about an hour on Tuesday, where they explained the story of how the boy went missing.",
      "\u201cI had the privilege of meeting with the family in my office yesterday, and what I will tell you is there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the room,\u201d Weekly said.",
      "He noted that Aziz's father is in Colorado but hasn't met his son yet. The father told the sheriff he hadn't seen his son in nine years.",
      "Hartman, who has been in touch with the family, said Aziz\u2019s mother did not let his father see the child for about a year and a half amid the custody battle.",
      "\u201cThis is the only life that Aziz has known. It is going to take some time. It\u2019s baby steps to get up to that point, and there\u2019s just a lot of work to be done for this reunification,\u201d Weekly said. \u201cWe hope they find healing and hope in the days, weeks, months and even years ahead of them.\u201d",
      "The family released a statement via the sheriff's office saying, \u201cWe\u2019re overwhelmed with joy that Aziz has finally been found.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want to thank everyone for their support over the last seven years. We specifically want to recognize the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office for their exceptional work in solving this case. Now, as we navigate the next steps, we ask for privacy so that we can move forward as a family and heal together.\u201d",

They\u2019re still processing a lot of things \u2014 what has happened, where they were, they\u2019re still trying to figure out what Aziz has been through,\u201d she said. She added that reunification is a process that takes time, especially as Aziz was missing for about half his life.",
      "Where the investigation stands now",
      "The Douglas County sheriff\u2019s office said it\u2019s unclear what the couple was doing at that home that was for sale.",
      "Weekly said that deputies had executed a search warrant in Aurora, Colorado, where the couple was living.",
      "When asked if Aziz knew he was kidnapped, Weekly said, \"When deputies contacted the child in a driveway, the child immediately called the two people inside. So, we believe that the child was actually coached on what to say if they came into contact with law enforcement.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Aziz was living in Colorado and attending school under his real name.",
      "He said several identifications were discovered inside the vehicle the children were found in and are being investigated.",
      "The sheriff noted that both children in the car \u201cappeared to be healthy\u201d and both were taken into protective custody.",
      "Khalid and Bourgeois have preliminary hearings set for March 27 in Douglas County court.",
      "District Attorney George Brauchler told reporters Wednesday that Bourgeois faces 14 charges and Khalid nine. He noted that Bourgeois is charged with kidnapping and Khalid is not \u201cbecause one of the nuances of the law is that you cannot kidnap your own child.\u201d",
      "Authorities are asking anyone with knowledge about the case and Aziz's whereabouts in the past seven years to contact Metro Denver Crime Stoppers at 720-913-STOP (7867)."

      "The Wayne County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office\u00a0said it conducted examinations Feb. 11, the day after Amillah Currie, 2, and Darnell Currie, 9, died. Their mother, Tateona Williams, said she found them unresponsive and not breathing after the van the family was living in ran out of gas.",
      "The medical examiner's office said the manner of death for both children was an accident. Williams could not immediately be reached Thursday.",
      "Detroit Police Chief Todd Bettison said in a statement Thursday that the department received the medical examiner\u2019s report and \"will continue investigating the facts and circumstances of the case and submit our findings to the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\"",
      "Police declined to answer further questions.",
      "Toxicologist Aimee Nefcy told NBC affiliate WDIV of Detroit that there could have been an internal leak inside the vehicle or carbon monoxide could have filtered in through a cracked window.",
      "\"Once it gets inside the van, it settles to the bottom because it's heavier than normal air,\" she said. \"And it layers down on the bottom of the van and it doesn't circulate out because all the windows are up higher than where the carbon monoxide is sitting.\"",
      "Hours before the deaths, Williams had parked on the ninth floor of Hollywood Casino\u2019s parking garage. Bettison\u00a0has said that he believed the family used the garage for safety and to use the casino's bathroom. The temperature in the city that day was around 12 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Inside the van were Williams and her four children, her mother and her mother's child, People magazine reported.",
      "It's believed the family had moved around from various casino parking lots. Mayor Mike Duggan said at a news conference last month that the family reached out to a homeless response team Nov. 25 and said they had been living with another family but could no longer stay there and needed help finding a new place.",
      "Duggan said that during that conversation, \"there was no resolution reached on where they would go,\" and an outreach worker did not visit the family. The family had also reached out for help in the summer and the previous year, the mayor said. He called for a review into the family\u2019s request for assistance.",
      "Williams has since been given a new home. The city of Detroit and the Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries posted a video last week of her receiving the keys.",
      "\"We had to fix it, prep it, furnish it and then give them a good start so they don\u2019t have to go one day with no food or being outside anymore,\" said the organization\u2019s CEO and president, Chad Audi."

      "Upon dropping Matthew Hertgen off at around 10 p.m., the third brother saw Joseph Hertgen and later texted him to \u201ccontact him immediately if he needed any help,\u201d according to officials. He also reached out to Matthew Hertgen telling him to \u201chang in there,\u201d and invited him on a hike the next day. It was just over an hour later that Matthew Hertgen made the 911 call reporting Joseph\u2019s death.",
      "Matthew Hertgen had suffered from \u201csevere mental illness\u201d for five years, the third brother told officials. A poem posted to his Facebook months before the murder describes knives, blood and pain.",
      "He now faces first-degree murder, third-degree animal cruelty, and several weapons charges.",
      "In a hearing at Mercer County Court Thursday afternoon, Matthew Hertgen voluntarily consented to pre-trial detainment. His next court appearance will be on March 24, according to the judge."

      "Kingsley Wilson\u2019s social media attracted attention\u00a0earlier this week when people started resurfacing posts she shared on X in\u00a02023 and 2024, in which she used a talking point widely repeated by antisemitic advocates: that Leo Frank, a Jewish man convicted of raping and murdering a teenage girl and then lynched by a Georgia mob in 1915, but posthumously pardoned decades later, was in fact guilty. Frank is widely believed to have been falsely accused and unjustly convicted. His case led to the formation of the Anti-Defamation League.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply disturbed that any public official would parrot these hateful and false conspiracy theories, and we hope Kingsley Wilson will immediately retract her remarks.\u201d",
      "Wilson also has expressed opposition to U.S. military intervention abroad, posting days after the war in Gaza started, \u201cMy future children will not die in foreign ethnic conflicts a world away.\u201d In July, she called NATO \u201cnothing more than an international HR department.\u201d",
      "She specifically opposed American military support for Israel. At the end of 2024, Wilson wrote, \"Why is the U.S. military defending Israel & Ukraine\u2019s border but not our own?\", and in 2023, replied to an X post by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett: \u201cFight your own wars. America First.\u201d",
      "Wilson and the Department of Defense did not immediately reply to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment on Wilson\u2019s past posts, or whether they represent the views of the Pentagon.",
      "Wilson has also railed against U.S. funding for Ukraine, describing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an \u201centitled midget,\u201d and asking, \u201cWhy should American taxpayers help defend Ukraine?\u201d She has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling his \u201cencyclopedic knowledge of his people\u2019s history beyond impressive.\u201d",
      "On her X account, Wilson has shown support for Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, mentioning it multiple times along\u00a0with a German phrase that translates to \u201cforeigners out.\u201d",
      "She has previously declared \u201cMake Kosovo Serbia again,\u201d despite Kosovo being officially recognized as an independent state by the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0in the years after the two Balkan countries fought a war in the 1990s. Russia does not recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres from New York responded to Wilson\u2019s post last week, writing on X that she\u2019s \u201cshamefully attempting to delegitimize Kosovo.\u201d",
      "A significant number of Wilson\u2019s past posts on X peddle discredited conspiracy theories, including that Haitians living in the U.S. are \u201ceating cats\u201d and \u201cdirt,\u201d as well as the \"great replacement theory,\" the racist belief that ethnic white groups and their culture are being \u201creplaced\u201d by nonwhite immigrant groups in Western countries.",
      "On Thanksgiving in 2022, she wrote, \u201cREMINDER: the Native Americans were anything but peaceful before the arrival of white Europeans.\u201d",
      "Wilson has also repeatedly tweeted variations of the sentiment that\u00a0\u201cWhite, Christian males are the most demonized group in modern America,\u201d and argued that women should not be allowed to work as police officers or Secret Service agents. She has\u00a0also called transgender people \u201ccorrupted souls,\u201d and responded \u201cnot all heroes wear capes\u201d to a man being arrested for vandalizing a LGBTQ pride mural.",
      "The 26-year-old Wilson is the daughter of right-wing commentator and former Trump adviser Steve Cortes. Since graduating high school, she has mixed with conservative politicians and media personalities, snapping photos with Sen. Ted Cruz and appearing on episodes of right-wing commentator Tim Pool\u2019s podcast.\u00a0She worked for the conservative think tank Center for Renewing America and Gettr, the social media platform founded by former Trump aide Jason Miller.",
      "Wilson backed former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s nomination for attorney general and traveled with him and his wife Ginger to El Salvador in November. Ginger Gaetz called her \u201cone of the most articulate voices in politics.\u201d",
      "Some of her past posts have slammed Republicans, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. In February of last year, Wilson posted on X: \u201cRepublicans are a joke.\u00a0Only the Executive can save us. Trump 2024.\u201d"

    "summary": "I tried Bethenny Frankel's viral cottage cheese bagel recipe from TikTok, and it exceeded expectations, even as a registered dietitian.",
    "story": [
      "I know, I know. You\u2019re sick of gratuitous cottage cheese. You don\u2019t want any more cottage cheese toast, cottage cheese \u201cice cream\u201d or Brussels sprouts dipped in cottage cheese and mustard. I hear you. I thought I was done with it, too.",
      "But then I saw author and \u201cReal Housewives\u201d alum Bethenny Frankel\u2019s cottage cheese bagels, now with more cottage cheese.",
      "\u201cMy whole personality is not Chanel, it\u2019s not caviar, it\u2019s not chicken salad, it\u2019s not \u2018It Ends with Us.\u2019 It\u2019s bagels,\u201d she says earnestly, swooning over her love of these bready rings of power much in the way I do myself, \u201cThis is very big.\u201d",
      "Her new take is a riff on an older \u201cmagic,\u201d two-ingredient Greek yogurt bagel recipe. I made those a few years back, and while they are edible, I found them underwhelming \u2014 sort of biscuit-y, somehow both tough and lacking the characteristic chewy crust, and with a misplaced tang.",
      "Frankel\u2019s new bag(el) is to use whipped cottage cheese instead of yogurt, and to add an extra 1/4 cup of it. The final recipe makes four bagels and consists of just 1 cup of flour, 1\u00bd teaspoon of baking powder and 1\u00bc cups of cottage cheese blitzed in a blender or food processor, all shaped, brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with salt and seasonings. They\u2019re baked at 375 F for 25 minutes.",
      "Frankel notes that shaping them is a bit tricky because the dough is very sticky and suggests adding some extra flour before forming them the way you\u2019d like. \u201cLike any movie, it all happens in the edit,\u201d she quips.",
      "Her results look scrumptious \u2014 crusty, salt-studded and deeply brown, and as a registered dietitian, I like the idea of a quick, homemade food that is a balance between carbs and protein all in one bite. There\u2019s nothing whatsoever wrong with a regular bagel, and indeed my personality is heavily invested in their worth, but even a grocery-store bread-aisle bagel has as much carbohydrate as most adults should have at a single sitting, and those extra delicious, extra giant bakery bagels are almost always more than that. Including a whole one can make it harder to also get things like fruits or dairy without going a bit overboard.",
      "So, a bagel with high-quality protein built right in? That\u2019s a big selling point for me. But, just as importantly, I suspect that the extra cheesy protein might improve the texture compared to the yogurt bagels, so color me intrigued. Let\u2019s try them!",
      "The first step is to blend up the cottage cheese until it\u2019s smooth. I actually prefer the texture of whipped to regular for everything from dips to lasagna, so go ahead and do the whole container if you\u2019d like.",
      "Next, I whisked the flour and baking powder to make sure the leavening was evenly distributed, and just mixed the dough until all the flour was incorporated. There\u2019s no kneading. The dough is very sticky but I tried plopping a quarter of the mixture onto a little scattering of flour, sprinkled more on top and patted it gently into a disc. Then, I moved it to a corner of the parchment and poked a hole in the middle. With that little bit of minimal handling, I found I didn\u2019t need the bench scraper that Frankel used.",
      "The final step is the egg wash, and I chose four different toppings just to try them out: chunky pretzel salt, nigella seeds, Parmesan and cinnamon sugar. They really were ready for baking in the time it took to preheat the oven.",
      "Mine needed a couple of extra minutes on the top rack of the oven to brown enough, but once they were done, I was very happy with the result. I let them sit for about 15 minutes before slicing. (That\u2019s critical for any bread, to avoid a stodgy, gummy crumb when you cut through too soon.) The texture inside is very tender, more moist than your average bagel, and they need toasting to stand up to a spread of butter or cream cheese. The hole is mostly closed, but having it there in the first place allowed for even baking. The outer crust is wonderful \u2014 chewy, crisp in spots, and flavorful. It\u2019s not exactly a bagel shop bagel in terms of texture \u2014 more like an English muffin-bagel \u2014 but for a fresh, breakfast-y roll in 35 minutes flat, I\u2019ll happily call it bagel-adjacent.",
      "I tried using gluten-free flour for the cinnamon one (King Arthur\u2019s Gluten-Free Measure for Measure flour, for the record, but your mileage may vary with other flours), and it\u2019s not as fluffy or chewy, but it worked remarkably well for an unyeasted gluten-free bake. I also tried making separate batches with low-fat grocery-store cottage cheese versus a higher-priced, higher-protein brand, and they worked equally well.",
      "My one complaint is that they spread out rather than up, making for a flattish bagel, but it\u2019s thick enough to allow slicing for a sandwich. I might try baking them in English muffin rings or a jumbo muffin pan next time \u2014 and there definitely will be a next time! \u2014 to see whether that improves the shape without leaving them underdone in the middle. A doughnut pan or parchment cylinders stuck in the holes would maintain shape, too.",
      "Both the bagel I stored overnight in the fridge and the one I sliced and froze kept their character; it might have actually improved the texture a bit, making it slightly drier and more bagel-like. I tried a few different methods of reheating but the most successful was popping them in the toaster right out of the freezer.",
      "The egg wash is important to both appearance and outer texture, and it also gives your chosen toppings some sticktoitiveness. Don\u2019t skip it.",
      "I still think the internet\u2019s obsession with cottage cheese is on the far side of reasonable. A lot of the recipes that lean on it do so for fad-diet street cred, and most of the time, your dietitian is going to be happier if you eat all kinds of real food in moderation. This recipe makes some nutritional sense, though, and it delivers that in record time, with a delicious schmear. What could be better than that?"

      "Read on to learn more about the controversy surrounding \u201cWin or Lose.\u201d",
      "Was a trans character cut from the series?",
      "In December, Disney confirmed it was pulling a transgender storyline from an episode of \u201cWin or Lose.\u201d",
      "The storyline involved a character called Kai, voiced by trans actor Chanel Stewart, who is featured in the show\u2019s seventh episode.",
      "Kai is a star softball player who\u2019s struggling to please her perfectionist dad, according to Disney. She\u2019s also completely dedicated to her team.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s really special is that the Pickles mean a lot to Kai,\u201d director Carrie Hobson said in the show\u2019s production notes. \u201cThat\u2019s visualized in her perspective view as floating \u2014 she literally feels lighter than air. She\u2019s feeling total happiness. It washes over her and lifts her up.\u201d",
      "Kai\u2019s character was not cut, and she remains in the show. However, some pieces of dialogue have been edited out so that she is no longer presented as a transgender girl, Disney revealed in December.",

      "She also said that when she first landed the role of Kai at age 14, she was excited to play an openly trans character and give kids like her a voice.",
      "\u201cI wore it as a badge. I wore it with pride. I wore it with honor because it meant so much to me,\u201d she told Deadline. \u201cThe thought of authentically portraying a transgender teenage girl made me really happy. I wanted to make this for transgender kids like me.\u201d",

      "While the inclusion of Laurie, an openly Christian character in \u201cWin or Lose,\u201d has been drawing fresh attention recently, Laurie appears to have been part of the series from the beginning.",
      "The show\u2019s first episode centers on Laurie, a 12-year-old member of the Pickles who struggles with anxiety on and off the field.\u00a0She is voiced by Rosie Foss.",
      "In the first episode, which came out Feb. 19, Laurie is seen praying before a game.",
      "\u201cDear Heavenly Father, please give me strength,\u201d she says. \u201cI have faith, but sometimes the doubt creeps in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want to catch a ball, or get a hit,\u201d her character also says.",

      "\u201cLater in life I asked my Dad, \u2018How good was I?\u2019 His response was, \u2018You weren\u2019t a natural talent, but you worked hard!\u2019 That\u2019s true for Laurie, too,\u201d Hobson said. \u201cHer breathing\u2019s a little labored and she\u2019s a bit clumsy, but she\u2019s convinced herself that if she works hard enough good things will happen.\u201d",

      "This shift comes as companies including Paramount, Amazon and Walmart have also scaled back their DEI initiatives in response to Trump\u2019s recent executive order urging the private sector to roll back \u201cDEI programs or principles\u201d that constitute what he calls \u201cillegal discrimination.\u201d",
      "Disney has not commented on the inclusion of an openly Christian character in \"Win or Lose,\" but the company did address the removal of the show's gender identity references in a December statement to The Hollywood Reporter.",

    "summary": "What happens at the end of Anora? Here's why Ani starts crying in the final scene of Anora and what happens in the car between her and Igor.",
    "story": [
      "At this year's Oscars, millions watched as an independent film about a professional sex worker who marries a Russian oligarch \u2014 only to get dumped when his parents show up \u2014 took home five Oscars, including best picture.",
      "But \u201cAnora\u201d isn\u2019t quite so easily boiled down: Thanks to lead actress winner Mikey Madison (Ani) \u2014 and many scenes with her co-star, supporting actor nominee Yura Borisov (Igor) \u2014 it\u2019s clear there\u2019s more to this story.",
      "So what was the movie all about? Why is the final car scene important \u2014 and why does Ani cry? Let\u2019s jump in, kicking and screaming, just like Ani would.",
      "Note: Spoilers for \"Anora\" ahead.",
      "What happens in \u2018Anora\u2019?",
      "Ani works in a strip club, providing exotic dance experiences to the patrons \u2014 and she\u2019s good at what she does.",
      "When the callow young son of a Russian oligarch, Ivan (Mark Edelshteyn), takes a shine to her, they take the party away from the club and discover they like having fun together. He has the money, she\u2019s easy with sex, and they\u2019re just a couple of wild kids enjoying a few days of lust.",
      "That is, until Ivan realizes that if he marries her he can stay in the US and not go back home to be a grown-up, working at his father\u2019s company. Ani is initially unsure, but decides to go for the ride.",
      "They hit Las Vegas and marry in a quickie chapel, continuing the party until his parents get word of what he\u2019s done \u2026 and send thugs to pry the pair apart. This is easier than you\u2019d think, because when Ivan's parents' cronies show up to Ivan\u2019s house, he gives them the slip and leaves Ani to deal with the fallout.",
      "Ani turns into a tiger, refusing to be bound, silenced or told she has to get divorced. While searching for the errant Ivan \u2014 and as his parents fly over from Russia to get the job done \u2014 the thugs, including a sympathetic Igor, haul Ani around New York City trying to find the young man.",
      "In the end, this Cinderella story does not have a happy ending. Ivan\u2019s parents ensure the divorce happens, leaving Ani in a precarious position, her life changed forever.",
      "Why is the final car scene important?",
      "Whether or not you\u2019ve approved of Ani\u2019s choices throughout the film, it\u2019s hard not to admire the way she simply does not give in. She bellows her lungs out, kicks, punches, bites and does whatever she can to try and get away from the thugs who\u2019ve bound her up.",
      "They\u2019re reasonable reasonable thugs, as thugs go: They just want her to sign a divorce agreement, take some hush money, and go away. But for a very long time she\u2019s positive Ivan has no interest in letting her go. Ani \u2014 and Mikey \u2014 truly gives her all.",
      "\u201cI wanted to flip it on its head,\u201d director, writer, editor and producer Sean Baker told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cWe give you a romantic comedy for the first 50 minutes, and we even sandwich it with a quintessential song, Take That\u2019s \u2018The Greatest Day,\u2019 which is maybe a song you would hear in a \u2018Love, Actually\u2019 sort of movie. But then we\u2019re giving you another 90 minutes of reality after that.\u2019\u201d",
      "And after that 90 minutes of reality, Ani is wiped out emotionally and physically. She\u2019d believed that this was going to change her life for the better, and that Ivan could be someone she could be with for the long haul. But he chose not to stand up for her, and she is repeatedly humiliated by his family (at one point, his mom calls her a \"disgusting hooker\").",
      "In the final scene, she\u2019s left in a car with Igor \u2014 the one character who has shown her compassion and has not seen her in a transactional way \u2014 and two important things happen: She breaks down, and they start to become intimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to hear other people\u2019s interpretations, because (the ending is) so open-ended, and I\u2019m more curious to hear what other people think \u2014 if they think that the characters will end up together or not, or why they think they end up having sex,\u201d Madison told Interview Magazine.",
      "One interpretation is that Ani uses sex as a way to thank Igor. But when he starts to kiss her, she turns away and starts crying. Sex becomes something that is more than transactional \u2014 and it appears to overwhelm her.",
      "Baker saw the sex in that scene as less transactional and more empowering in an interview with IndieWire.",
      "\"I see (the sex) as being about her and not really something that she\u2019s giving to him but something in which she\u2019s now regaining the power that she lost entirely throughout this journey,\u201d he said.",
      "Why does Ani cry in that car?",
      "Crying before she\u2019s lost everything, before she\u2019s in a safe place, would be a sign of weakness \u2014 as Ani, and undoubtedly the Russians around her \u2014 would see it.",
      "But after everything\u2019s been lost and she\u2019s now around the one person she can feel some level of safe with, Igor, Ani can finally let the tension, the stress, the adrenaline and the anger come pouring out. So she cries.",
      "\u201cYura is such a soulful actor,\u201d Madison said in an interview with Isabelle Huppert for Interview Magazine. \u201cThe whole film, my character has been covering up her emotions with a hardness, not letting anybody see her crack, so I found myself also feeling like that during filming. I was never emotional, and me as Mikey, I\u2019m a very emotional person. For the last scene, I was almost shaking going into the car because I didn\u2019t know what that would feel like \u2014 because I had been feeling the same way as my character for so long.\u201d",
      "The movie ends with Ani in tears, her future, and her connection with Igor, left uncertain. But one thing is for sure: She's back to her old life, though her brush with the world's ultra-rich and ultra-powerful changed her forever."

      "For example, Elphaba's all black dresses are actually rich with detail. He incorporated patterns inspired by the natural world, like mushrooms and fungi, into her dresses as an homage to her fight for  Animals' rights. Meanwhile, the costumes of Madame Morrible, who is disconnected from the natural world (spoilers!), were inspired by the brass work within Rockefeller Center.",
      "Glinda and Elphaba's costumes were meant to tell a story about their personalities and approaches, Tazewell said.",
      "\u201cMy hope was to create two women (who were) very intentional in how they present themselves,\u201d he told TODAY.com. \u201cGlinda is privileged. She sees the world through rose-colored glasses. That\u2019s her armor, the same way that Elphaba uses black as her armor. There\u2019s nothing accidental about what their styling is. I wanted for each of them to feel and and appear as beautiful as possible, even in how they represent themselves.\u201d",
      "Tazewell's work on both \"Wicked\" films \u2014 the second one will come out this November \u2014 is not even the first time he had to encounter the world of Oz.",
      "Tazewell won an Emmy for his costumes for NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Wiz: Live\u201d in 2022, another musical set in Oz. Tazewell\u2019s recent Broadway project \u201cDeath Becomes Her\" features a moment where the protagonist transforms into Dorothy.",
      "Most of Tazewell's credits to date have been for stage productions, like the Broadway musicals \u201cBring in \u2018Da Noise, Bring in \u2018Da Funk,\u201d \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud,\u201d \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and \u201cCaroline, or Change.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is considering a major change\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S.\u2019 participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three current and former senior U.S. officials\u00a0and one congressional official.",
      "Trump has discussed with aides the possibility of calibrating America\u2019s NATO engagement in a way that favors members of the alliance that spend a set percentage of their gross domestic\u00a0product\u00a0on defense, the officials said.",
      "As part of the potential policy shift, the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold, the officials said. If\u00a0Trump does make that change, it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet of the alliance known as Article 5,\u00a0which says that an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all\u00a0of them.",
      "The president is similarly considering a policy change in which the U.S. may choose to prioritize military exercises with NATO members that are spending the set percentage of their GDPs on defense, the officials said. His administration has already signaled to America\u2019s European allies that the U.S. could reduce its military presence in Europe, and one option now under consideration is to reposition some U.S. troops in the region so they are focused in or around NATO countries that have scaled their defense spending to meet the specific percentage of their GDPs, the officials said.",
      "Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S. engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a written statement, \u201cPresident Trump is committed to NATO and Article V.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense and a senior senator on the Foreign Relations panel, said Trump\u2019s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, \u201cgave very reassuring answers\u201d on the administration\u2019s commitment to NATO and Article 5.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the current NATO member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts an added burden on the U.S.",
      "NATO countries agreed more than a decade ago to set the spending goal for each of them at 2% of GDP. But Trump has pushed to increase that percentage. Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said in January after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "According to NATO\u2019s most recent statistics, last year 23 NATO members\u2019 defense spending exceeded 2% of their GDP. Five of those nations\u00a0\u2014 Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. \u2014 spent more than 3% on defense.\u00a0Poland\u00a0had the highest percentage,\u00a0dedicating 4.12% of its GDP to defense.",
      "The potential shift in how the U.S. participates in NATO comes as Trump is pushing European allies to do more to aid Ukraine\u00a0in its war with Russia\u00a0and to play a major role in maintaining peace in the country if a\u00a0deal to end the war is reached.",
      "\u201cI was contacted by several European ambassadors concerned about rumors that Trump might make some negative announcement about NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday. Trump didn\u2019t announce anything at his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, but Coons said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not given pause by everything about President Trump\u2019s statements and actions on foreign policy, you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d",
      "Trump threatened to withdraw\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0from NATO during his first term and has questioned the merits of Article\u00a05\u00a0for the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0The article was designed to protect European nations from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It has been triggered just once, after the\u00a09/11\u00a0attacks on the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials say is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China\u2019s first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The intended targets were in some cases directed by China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, suggested Wednesday that the allegations were a \u201csmear\u201d and said, \u201cWe hope that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude and base their characterization of cyber incidents on sufficient evidence rather than groundless speculation and accusations.\u201d",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",

      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They\u2019ve downsized and moved offices.",

      "The air force said four of the bombs misfired because one of the fighter jet pilots entered incorrect coordinates during the flight preparation process, and that further investigation was needed to determine\u00a0why the second jet incorrectly dropped the four other bombs.",
      "\u201cThere are procedures to verify coordinates both on the ground and in the air. However, it appears that a mistake was made in this process,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.",
      "The JCS said live-fire drills were being suspended but that the Freedom Shield exercise would go ahead as planned.",
      "Two of the 15 people were civilians with serious but not life-threatening injuries, fire authorities told reporters. Those with minor injuries included two soldiers who were at a military chapel and two foreign nationals who were in the area.",
      "Eight buildings also sustained damage, officials said, including the chapel, five houses, one warehouse and one greenhouse.",
      "Photographs from the scene showed debris at the church and residences with shattered windows. Residents were being evacuated as authorities searched for any unexploded bombs.",

      "Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong \u2014 core members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China \u2014 were convicted in 2023 during Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement. They received a sentence of 4 1/2 months and have already served their terms.",
      "The alliance was long known for organizing candlelight vigils in the city on the anniversary of the Chinese military\u2019s crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing. But it voted to disband in 2021 under the shadow of a sweeping national security law imposed by China.",
      "Critics said the shutdown and the case showed that the city\u2019s Western-style civil liberties were shrinking despite promises they would be kept intact when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",

      "After the ruling, Tang told reporters outside the court that he hoped the top court\u2019s ruling proved that the alliance was not a foreign agent and that in the future they could prove that the 1989 movement was not a counter-revolutionary riot.",
      "\u201cJustice lives in people\u2019s hearts. Regardless of the outcome, everyone knows the truth in their hearts,\u201d he said.",
      "During an earlier hearing at the top court in January, Chow, who represented herself, said her case highlighted what a police state is.",
      "\u201cA police state is created by the complicity of the court in endorsing such abuses. This kind of complicity must stop now,\u201d she said.",
      "Since the security law was introduced in 2020, several non-permanent overseas judges have quit the top court, raising questions over confidence in the city\u2019s judicial system. In 2024, Jonathan Sumption quit his position and said the rule of law was profoundly compromised.",
      "But Cheung in January said the judges\u2019 premature departures did not mean the judiciary\u2019s independence was weakening.",
      "The annual vigil at Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Park was the only large-scale public commemoration of the June 4 crackdown on Chinese soil for decades. Thousands attended it annually until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures.",
      "After Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, the park was occupied instead by a carnival organized by pro-Beijing groups. Those who tried to commemorate the event near the site were detained.",
      "Chow and two other former alliance leaders, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, were charged with subversion in a separate case under the security law. They remain in custody, awaiting the beginning of their trial.",
      "In a separate ruling on Thursday, judges at the top court dismissed jailed pro-democracy activist Tam Tak-chi\u2019s bid to overturn his sedition convictions in a landmark case brought under a colonial-era law that was used to crush dissent.",
      "Tam was the first person tried under the sedition law since the 1997 handover and was found guilty of 11 charges in 2022, including seven counts of \u201cuttering seditious words.\u201d",
      "The colonial-era law was repealed last year after the government introduced a new, homegrown security law that it said was necessary for stability. Critics worry the law will further curtail freedoms."

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 A suspected participant in the suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 American service members and roughly 170 Afghan civilians during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan arrived in the U.S. on Wednesday to face criminal charges in connection with the attack.",
      "Mohammad Sharifullah was taken into custody over the weekend and admitted during an FBI interrogation to being a member of the Islamic State group\u2019s affiliate in Afghanistan and to his role in the August 2021 suicide bombing and other attacks, according to U.S. officials.",
      "President Donald Trump announced the arrest during his Tuesday night address to Congress, telling the audience that he was \u201cpleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\u201d",
      "Senior Pakistani intelligence officers on Wednesday confirmed the arrest and said Sharifullah, also known as Jafar, was captured in the country\u2019s restive southwest Balochistan province near the border with Afghanistan after multiple operations had failed to seize him.",
      "Sharifullah is charged in federal court in Virginia with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, resulting in death. He wore a light-blue jail jumpsuit and listened through headphones as an interpreter translated the proceedings. His public defender declined to comment after his court appearance, which ended with him being held until at least a detention hearing set for Monday.",
      "The Abbey Gate bombing, in the waning days of an airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover of the country amid the withdrawal by U.S. forces from the country, occurred in August 2021 when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul\u2019s airport. Besides 13 U.S. service members, about 170 Afghans were also killed in the attack, which triggered widespread congressional criticism and undermined public confidence in the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the conclusion of the war.",
      "According to an FBI affidavit filed as part of the case, Sharifullah admitted under questioning to having joined the Afghanistan-based Islamic State-Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K, in 2016. He told investigators that he was in prison from 2019 until about two weeks before the bombing, at which point he was contacted by another ISIS-K member about helping in the attack, the affidavit said.",
      "He was given a motorcycle, funds for a cellphone and a SIM card, as well as instructions for communicating via social media during the attack operation, prosecutors said. He admitted to participating in the Abbey Gate attack by scouting a route to the airport for the bomber and communicating to other members of the militant group that the path was clear.",
      "Sharifullah said he was instructed to leave the area and later learned that the bombing was done by an ISIS-K operative he had met while jailed, the affidavit said.",
      "The bomber was identified as Abdul Rahman al-Logari, an Islamic State group militant who had been in an Afghan prison but was released by the Taliban as the group took control of the country that summer.",
      "During his FBI interrogation, Sharifullah also said he had shared firearms and weapons instructions before a March 2024 attack at a Moscow concert hall that was also carried out by ISIS-K and killed scores of people, authorities said.",
      "Sharifullah was arrested in 2019 by the U.S.-backed Afghan government at the time but escaped from prison on Aug. 15, 2021, as the Taliban took Kabul.",
      "The Pakistani officials said Sharifullah had planned the bombing from behind bars with other senior militant figures. They said he remained on the run in the border areas of Balochistan until his arrest through a joint intelligence-sharing operation between Pakistan and the U.S.",
      "Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for \u201cacknowledging and appreciating\u201d the country\u2019s role in counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,\u201d Sharif said on the social media platform X.",
      "From Kabul, the Taliban chief spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid declined to comment beyond saying that the arrest \u201con Pakistani soil\u201d of an Afghan national and member of the Islamic State group shows that IS group figures \u201chave taken refuge and established havens\u201d inside Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThis issue has nothing to do with Afghanistan,\u201d Mujahid said. The regional Islamic State affiliate is a rival group to the Afghan Taliban."
