      "John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life",
      "CHICAGO -- John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life. During the team\u2019s last homestand, he got a text message from a high school friend. It was the first text he had received from him.",
      "Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used \u201cFront to Back\u201d \u2014 a song from Hauldren's electronic music group, Levity \u2014 as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "\u201cI was like \u2018What? Like, no way,'\" Hauldren recalled. \u201cI, like, had to do my research for myself.\u201d",
      "Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.",
      "Crow-Armstrong's girlfriend has a cousin who is friends with the girlfriend of PJ Carberry, another member of Levity.",
      "\u201cMy girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona,\u201d Crow-Armstrong said. \u201cI had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it.\u201d",
      "Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June's \u201cStill Boomin\u201d for his walkup song. He said he isn't a big fan of dubstep \u2014 the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time \u2014 but he likes Levity's stuff.",
      "Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrong's daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song.",
      "\u201cMusic\u2019s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong\u2019s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.",
      "But he was always a Cubs fan.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.\u201d",
      "The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.",
      "Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of \u201cFront to Back\u201d at their place in Bucktown \u2014 not far from Wrigley Field.",
      "\u201cMy window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,\u201d Hauldren said. \u201cAnd so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.\u201d",
      "After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.",
      "Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago's Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.\u201d",

      "The category also includes \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d a rom-com musical about a pair of androids that crackles with humanity and Dead Outlaw, a musical about a real life alcoholic drifter turned failed bandit who was shot dead in 1911 and whose afterlife proved to be stranger than fiction as he was displayed for decades.",
      "A second show with a corpse, the British import \u201cOperation Mincemeat,\u201d also made it, the improbably true story about a British deception operation designed to mislead Nazi Germany about the location of the Allied landing at Sicily.",
      "In the best play category, \u201cEnglish,\u201d Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sanaz Toossi\u2019s  look at four Iranian students preparing for an English language exam, made the cut.

      "LOS ANGELES -- NBC is continuing its strategy of infusing the Olympics with pop culture and celebrity appeal to generate momentum ahead of the Milan-Cortina Winter Games in Italy next year.",
      "This time, Italian American comedians Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco will make their debut during a comical promotion, the network said on Wednesday. The commercial will air during NBC\u2019s Kentucky Derby coverage on Saturday.",
      "In the spot, Romano and Maniscalco stand atop the Italian Alps with snowboards in hand, attempting to discuss thrilling winter sports like skiing, snowboarding and luge. But their discussion is repeatedly sidetracked by their shared obsession with Italian food.",
      "\u201cRay and I teamed up for the Olympics, two Italian guys trying to figure out winter sports,\u201d Maniscalco said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, we thought \u2018luge\u2019 was a type of pasta.\u201d",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

      "But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d translated to Napoleonic-era France",
      "He\u2019s a dream in the kitchen \u2014 and elsewhere in the house. He makes a mean cream-puff tower. And he\u2019s got moves like Jagger.",
      "Alas, Antonin Car\u00eame has been dead since the 1830s, but nobody\u2019s perfect, right?",
      "Most people have heard of Napoleon, but not many are familiar \u2014 even in France \u2014 with the story of this chef who cooked for him and his contemporaries, rising from a poor kitchen boy to become a standard-bearer of French cuisine. Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",
      "But for the vibe, think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d set in post-revolutionary Paris. Car\u00eame even directs his staff at one point to say \u201cOui, chef.\u201d (And we could totally imagine him, like Jeremy Allen White, in a Calvin Klein underwear ad, if those had existed back then.)",
      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",
      "Still, his goal was to be the best chef in the world. The show\u2019s first season ends with an extraordinary outdoor coronation banquet that Car\u00eame creates for thousands of people. When he places, in triumph, a tall white chef\u2019s hat on his head for the first time, it's as if he's crowning himself \u2014 and marking his ascent to celebrity.",
      "Benjamin Voisin, who's in virtually every scene, plays Car\u00eame with a scruffy head of hair, a gold earring and a bad-boy swagger that's consciously based on Mick Jagger, circa \u201970s.",
      "Director Martin Bourboulon says the choice for the role was obvious once Voisin walked into the audition room.",
      "\u201cWhen you find the right actor for the right part, 80% of the job is done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were very impressed with his youthful attitude but also his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude. He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "NEW YORK -- Like all brides, Elana Goldin had high hopes for her wedding photos and video.",
      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",
      "Michelle Jackson, who owns the photo vendor Bambino International based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said some basic questions about equipment can go a long way.",
      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",
      "Each group is assigned a number that's announced when it's time to gather.",
      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",

      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",
      "\u201cDraw me a blueprint of a perfect summer lineup: 2025 is it,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun twist on what a movie like this could be,\u201d says \u201cThunderbolts\u201d director Jake Schreier.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new,\u201d says \u201cSuperman\u201d director James Gunn. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about the robots and the flying dogs and all that stuff. It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople say, like, do you feel pressure and the most pressure I feel is from myself as a fan and to Steven Spielberg, to not disappoint him,\" says \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d director Gareth Edwards. \u201cWeirdly what\u2019s great about doing a Jurassic movie is that everybody knows deep down that like half the reason they\u2019re in this business is because of that film and Steven\u2019s work.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, all but one summer since 2007 broke the $4 billion mark. Since 2020, only one has: 2023, led by \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",
      "\u201cBy the end of this summer, hopefully people aren\u2019t talking about being in a funk anymore and it feels like we got our mojo back and we\u2019re off to the races,\" Kosinski, who directed the pandemic-era hit \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d says.",

      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "The retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.",
      "Weinstein's attorneys have argued that all three accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected to show that Haley is 48, not 47.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",

      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",

      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",

      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict.

An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "WREXHAM, Wales -- Wrexham fans ignored the warnings. They were always going to.",
      "By the time the final whistle blew on Saturday to confirm promotion to English soccer's second tier, thousands were ready and waiting to storm the home field in celebration.",
      "Flares were lit, red smoke filled the air, Welsh flags were waved proudly and songs sung raucously.",
      "Wrexham was one step from the Premier League and nothing was going to stop this party.",
      "Charlton was beaten 3-0 to ensure Wrexham went up as the third division runner-up behind champion Birmingham, and co-owner Ryan Reynolds reflected on their third promotion in three seasons.",
      "\u201cIt just seemed like an impossible dream,\u201d the movie star said. \u201cWe said five years ago our goal was to make it to the Premier League. There were understandably a lot of laughs, but it feels like a thing that could make it to fruition right now.\u201d",
      "There were warnings of police action for pitch invaders before kickoff. And as the game reached its final moments, an announcement over the loudspeaker told fans it could be stopped if they didn't move back behind barricades.",
      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",

      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",

      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is for those supporters who followed the team in those 15 years in the (non-league) National League in really, really tough times, but stood strong behind their club and they deserve tonight,\u201d Parkinson said.",

      "Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.",
      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",
      "In March, Texas filed criminal charges against a Houston midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions, and the state is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",

      "Florida is poised to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates who say the mineral is a safe, effective way to protect people of all ages from developing cavities",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida is poised to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates who say the mineral is a safe, effective way to protect people of all ages from developing cavities.",
      "Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill Tuesday. The measure now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against the fluoridation of community water systems, arguing high levels could pose a risk to children\u2019s intellectual development.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water is considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "\u201cAs dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it\u2019s a real tragedy when policymakers\u2019 decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,\u201d Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cBlindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy.\u201d",
      "While Florida's bill doesn't specifically reference fluoride, it will require the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state, said bill sponsor Republican state Rep. Kaylee Tuck.",
      "\u201cAnything that relates to water quality, removing contaminants, things like that, we're not touching that,\" Tuck said. \"It's anything that has to do with health. So fluoride, vitamins, whatever else it is.\u201d",
      "Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month, approving legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride has come under increased scrutiny under the influence of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",
      "Some local officials in Florida have already voted to remove the mineral from their community water systems, ahead of state lawmakers' push to ban fluoride.",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Tuesday she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the passage of the bill, adding that it disregards \u201cthe overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\u201d",
      "Levine Cava said that ending fluoridation, which is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay, will have \u201clong-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "The mayor said the decision should be left to local communities.",
      "About one-third of community water systems, serving more than 60% of the U.S. population, fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 analysis by the CDC.",

    "story": [
      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly approved paid sick leave laws last year",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska were asked last year whether they wanted to require employers to provide paid sick leave to their workers. They overwhelmingly said yes.",
      "Now some lawmakers in each of those states are trying to roll back the benefits, citing concerns from businesses about costs.",
      "The efforts mark the latest attempt by legislators to alter laws backed by the voters they represent. In February, for example, Michigan enacted revisions to a paid sick leave law initiated by voters seven years ago, delaying the date when small businesses must comply and allowing a longer period before new employees are eligible.",
      "Though some voters are outraged, some lawmakers contend that citizen activists who crafted the initiatives overlooked the realities of running a business.",
      "Restaurant owner Tim Hart, who employs about two dozen workers at his steakhouse in Hannibal, Missouri, said the paid sick leave requirement imposes a double financial hit because he must pay one person to stay home and another to fill the shift.",
      "\u201cWhen this goes into effect, we very likely won\u2019t survive,\u201d said Hart, who has urged the state Senate to halt the law.",
      "The paid sick leave laws are set to kick in Thursday in Missouri, July 1 in Alaska and Oct. 1 in Nebraska.",
      "McDonald's restaurant worker Richard Eiker is among those who stand to benefit. He signed a petition putting the initiative on the Missouri ballot and traveled recently from Kansas City to the state Capitol to lobby lawmakers to let the law stand.",
      "In 40 years on the job, Eiker has never received paid sick leave \u2014 not even when he was struggling with a kidney stone.",
      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",
      "But many workers already have it tough, Democratic lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck, just missing a little bit of work can really put them behind,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Patty Lewis said.",
      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",
      "Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, which supported the ballot measure, doubts Ruffridge\u2019s bill will gain traction in the final weeks of this year's session.",
      "But, she said, \u201cI believe this is the beginning of a long battle to protect the voters\u2019 wishes from the wills and the whims of the businesspeople who don\u2019t want to pay sick days.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",
      "A second ambulance arrived and the crew rushed Hoffman to the hospital, where he died later that afternoon.",
      "Thompson said any conviction on the murder charge could draw a life sentence without possibility of parole \u2014 or even a death sentence. But he did not elaborate on prosecution plans and said police continue to investigate what he described as a \u201chorrific\u201d crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be perfectly clear,\" he said. \"Our office will use all legal, moral, and ethical tools at our disposal to ensure justice for Graham, his family and the entire community.\u201d",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors in Thailand say they don't intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation",
      "BANGKOK -- State prosecutors in Thailand announced Thursday that they don't intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.",
      "The arrest last month of Paul Chambers, a political science lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, had drawn concern from the academic community, especially from Asian studies scholars around the world, as well as the U.S. government",
      "The decision not to prosecute the 58-year-old Oklahoma native doesn't immediately clear him of the charge of insulting the monarchy\u2014 also known as \u201cl\u00e8se majest\u00e9\u201d \u2014 or a related charge of violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activities.",
      "The announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.",
      "Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, was arrested in early April on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command.",
      "He has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.",
      "Chambers\u2019 supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, wasn't written by him.",
      "He had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.",
      "Chambers\u2019 visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. It wasn't immediately clear whether the revocation will stand.",
      "\u201cThis case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\u201d a U.S. State Department statement said after Chambers' arrest. \u201dWe continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\u201d",
      "Thailand\u2019s l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law calls for three to 15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it's among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.",
      "That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the law.",

      "As a child, Sister Inah Canabarro was so skinny that many people didn\u2019t think she would survive into adulthood, Cleber Canabarro, her 84-year-old nephew, told The Associated Press in January,",
      "Her great-grandfather was a famed Brazilian general who took up arms during the turbulent period following Brazil\u2019s independence from Portugal in the 19th century.",
      "She took up religious work while she was a teenager and spent two years in Montevideo, Uruguay, before moving to Rio de Janeiro and eventually settling in her home state of Rio Grande do Sul. A lifelong teacher, among her former students was Gen. Joao Figueiredo, the last of the military dictators who governed Brazil between 1964 and 1985.

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Throngs of dachshunds strut their stubby stuff in Hungary on Thursday as they tried to fetch a record for the country's biggest ever single-breed dog walk.",
      "Hundreds of dogs and their owners gathered at the Budapest City Park and walked in a long, noisy loop in the spring sun. The parade of pups was under the observation of the Hungarian Records Association, which was tasked with determining whether the canine cavalcade could be officially entered into the record books.",
      "Istv\u00e1n Sebesty\u00e9n, registrar and president of the association, said his organization would carefully tally the number of participating dogs \u2014 a challenge, he said, when so many hounds and humans were gathered in one place.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t usually take dachshunds on walks in droves, so this experiment has to correspond to our system of rules,\u201d he said.",

      "Also known as \u201cwiener dogs\u201d or \u201csausage dogs\u201d for their long, low-slung bodies, they were initially bred for hunting badgers and other burrowing creatures. But their loyal, curious and playful nature has also made them popular as family pets.",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of people in Serbia on Thursday marked six months since a train station tragedy in the country's north killed 16 people and triggered a wave of anti-corruption protests that have shaken populist President Aleksandar Vucic's tight grip on power.",
      "Workers' unions joined university students in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, to demand changes in labor and strike laws as part of Labor Day protests. In the northern city of Novi Sad, residents left flowers and lit candles outside the central station where tons of concrete crashed on the people standing or sitting underneath on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia blamed alleged rampant government corruption fueling negligence and disrespect of safety regulations for the tragedy. The concrete canopy at the outer wall of the building had been renovated twice before the disaster as part of a major infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.",
      "Almost daily protests since the crash have developed into a nationwide movement demanding changes.",
      "Thousands marched in Novi Sad on Thursday after holding a commemorative silence for the victims near the station. University students, a key force behind the anti-graft movement, set up a stone monument with an inscription saying: \"Novi Sad remembers.\"",
      "\u201cToday, we declared the train station building for a memorial site,\u201d a student told the crowd. \u201cIt will serve as a reminder what happens when corruption takes over the state.\u201d",
      "In Belgrade, union flags mixed with student banners outside the Serbian government building in a downtown area as thousands streamed in from various parts of the city for the gathering.",
      "\u201cCorruption kills!\u201d said one student, who did not say his name. \u201cThis is why the fight against corruption must be held not only at (student) blockades but also at work place.\u201d",
      "Populist supporters of President Vucic meanwhile enjoyed a May Day barbecue, drinks and folk music in a pro-government camp outside the parliament building and in an adjacent park by the presidential palace. The guarded camp, set up weeks ago, also hosted masked ex-paramilitary fighters apparently as protection for Vucic.",
      "Vucic has accused the anti-graft protesters of staging a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d under Western instructions to oust him from power and \u201cdestroy\u201d Serbia. He has organized parallel rallies to counter almost daily street demonstrations that have drawn tens of thousands of people for some of the biggest ever anti-government rallies in the country.",
      "Serbia's populist leader has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms, including pressure on the protesting students. In the latest incident on Monday in Novi Sad, police used batons and pepper spray while pushing protesters away from a sports faculty building. Several people were injured.",
      "Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership but the accession process recently has been stalled amid Vucic's increasing authoritarianism.",

      "South Korea\u2019s acting leader, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, says he is resigning amid reports he will run in next month\u2019s presidential election",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s acting leader, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, said Thursday he is resigning to take on \u201cheavier responsibility\u201d amid expectation he will run in next month\u2019s presidential election.",
      "Han has emerged as a potential conservative standard bearer as the main conservative People Power Party remains in disarray over ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol 's stunning martial law imposition in December. South Korean media reported Han will officially launch his presidential campaign Friday.",
      "\u201cI have two paths ahead of me. One is completing the heavy responsibility that I handle now. The other is putting down that responsibility and taking a heavier responsibility,\u201d Han said in a nationally televised announcement. \u201cI\u2019ve finally determined to put down my post to do what I can and what I have to help overcome the crises facing us.\u201d",
      "Han, who Yoon had appointed prime minister, the country\u2019s No. 2 post, is expected to align with the People Power Party to launch a unified conservative campaign against liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung, observers say.",
      "Han, 75, is a career bureaucrat with about 40 years of public service and a Harvard doctorate in economics. He has held top posts under both conservative and liberal governments, including trade minister, finance minister and ambassador to the U.S. He\u2019s served as prime minster twice, first under liberal President Roh Moo-hyun from 2007 to 2008 and later under Yoon.",
      "Han\u2019s supporters say his extensive government experience, especially on economic affairs, would make him the right leader who can deal with President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies and other economic problems. But his critics say Han \u2014 who has never had an elected post \u2014 has no strong political support base and is too old to become president.",
      "With Han\u2019s resignation, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok becomes acting president until a new leader is elected on June 3.",
      "Lee, who won the nomination of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party on Sunday, has been favored to win. But his campaign suffered a blow Thursday after the Supreme Court ordered a lower court to review its earlier cancellation of his conviction over election law violation charges.",
      "While it's unclear the Seoul High Court will come up with a new ruling on Lee before the June 3 election, the development provided his conservative rivals with fodder for a political offensive. Under South Korean law, anyone who receives a fine exceeding 1 million won ($683) for election law violations is barred from running for elections for five years.",
      "In a Gallup Korea poll released on Friday, Lee won 38% of support ratings, while Han had 6% and four People Power Party aspirants won a combined 23%.",
      "The People Power Party is to elect its candidate this Saturday.",
      "After the liberal opposition-controlled parliament impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over his martial law declaration that plunged the country into turmoil, Han began serving as acting leader, trying to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets.",
      "But Han quickly clashed with Lee\u2019s Democratic Party over his refusal to fill three vacant seats on the nine-member Constitutional Court, which was deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. A court decision to dismiss Yoon needed support from at least six justices.",
      "In late December, the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach Han, accusing him of obstructing the restoration of the court\u2019s full membership and abetting Yoon\u2019s martial law decree. In March, however, the Constitutional Court overturned Han\u2019s impeachment, reinstating him as acting president. The court in early April ruled to dismiss Yoon.",

      "1972 \u2014 India and Pakistan sign a peace accord, renaming the ceasefire line in Kashmir as the Line of Control, a heavily fortified stretch of military outposts that divide the region between them.

      "JERUSALEM -- Several countries were sending firefighting aircraft to Israel on Thursday as crews battled for a second day to extinguish a wildfire that had shut down a major highway linking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and sent drivers scrambling from their cars.",
      "The fire broke out around midday on Wednesday, fueled by hot, dry conditions and fanned by strong winds that quickly whipped up the flames burning through a pine forest. Several communities were evacuated as a precaution as the smoke turned the skies over Jerusalem gray.",
      "The fire has burned about 5,000 acres (20 square kilometers) and is the most significant fire Israel has had in the past decade, according to Tal Volvovitch, a spokesperson for Israel\u2019s fire and rescue authority. She said the fire has \u201cmiraculously\u201d not damaged any homes.",
      "Israel\u2019s fire and rescue authority warned the public to stay away from parks or forests, and to be exceptionally careful while lighting barbecues. Thursday is Israel\u2019s Independence Day, which is typically marked with large family cookouts in parks and forests.",

      "Italy, Croatia, Spain, France, Ukraine, and Romania were sending planes to help battle the flames, while several other countries, including North Macedonia and Cyprus, were also sending water-dropping aircraft. Israeli authorities said 10 firefighting planes were operating on Thursday morning, with another eight aircraft to arrive during the course of the day.",
      "Israel's fire and rescue authority lifted the evacuation order on approximately a dozen towns in the Jerusalem hills on Thursday.",

But there were no injuries, and historic churches were not affected.",

On Thursday morning, broad swathes of burned areas were visible from the highway, while pink anti-flame retardant dusted the top of burned trees and bushes. Smoke and the smell of fire hung heavy in the air.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- If the next pope is from sub-Saharan Africa, he would be the first in Catholic Church history. Catholic Africans think it is a long shot, though some are cautiously optimistic that Pope Francis\u2019 successor could be a Black cardinal from their continent.",
      "The answer will come soon, as the cardinals eligible to elect the new pope open their conclave next Wednesday at the Sistine Chapel.",
      "At least three African cardinals are among those currently cited as \u201cpapabile,\" the term used by Vatican observers to describe possible contenders to lead the Catholic Church.",
      "They are Cardinals Robert Sarah of Guinea, Peter Turkson of Ghana and Fridolin Ambongo of Congo.",
      "If any of them is selected, he would be the first African pope in more than 1,500 years and the first ever from sub-Saharan Africa. That historical record makes many in Africa eager for change \u2014 but not overly hopeful.",
      "Before the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI, there was much media attention around Francis Arinze, a highly respected cardinal born in Nigeria, raising questions even then about whether the world was ready for a Black pope from Africa.",
      "Two decades later, Catholicism continues to decline in Europe while it grows in the developing world. The number of Catholics is growing faster in Africa than anywhere else.",
      "At least 20% of global Catholic community is in Africa, which \u201cis characterized by a highly dynamic spread of the Catholic Church,\u201d according to a recent Vatican report.",
      "Some say having a pope from Africa, or Asia \u2014 which is also seeing strong Catholic growth \u2014 would signal a powerful message of inclusion. But as Francis' papacy showed, inclusive efforts can alienate many others and even breed dissent.",
      "The three possible papal candidates from Africa \u2014 Sarah, Ambongo, and Turkson \u2014 are seen as holding orthodox views on some of the hot-button issues that the Catholic Church is grappling with, reflecting wider social conservatism on the continent of 1.3 billion people. Catholic orthodoxy in Africa was at odds with Pope Francis\u2019 pastoral vision of mercy and understanding for all marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ Catholics.",
      "The real-life situation was reflected in the fictional Oscar-nominated film \u201cConclave,\u201d in which one of the four contenders vying for the papacy was a socially conservative cardinal from Nigeria.",
      "Congo has the highest number of baptized Catholics in Africa.",
      "Ambongo \u2014 the archbishop of Congolese capital, Kinshasa, since 2018 \u2014 last year signed a statement by the conference of African bishops rejecting a Vatican declaration to allow priests to offer spontaneous, non-liturgical blessings to same-sex couples seeking God\u2019s grace.",
      "That statement, seen as a rebuke of Francis, asserted that same-sex unions were \u201ccontrary to the will of God.\" It cited biblical teaching condemning homosexuality and asserted that same-sex relations are \u201ccontradictory to cultural norms\u201d in Africa.",
      "But it is Sarah, the Guinean cardinal who is the Vatican\u2019s former liturgy chief, who posed a more public challenge to Francis.",
      "A favorite of traditionalists, Sarah prefers silent prayer and is an adherent of the old Latin Mass. He is a staunch defender of longstanding doctrinal faith.",
      "After Francis in 2021 reimposed restrictions on celebrating the Latin Mass that Benedict had relaxed, Sarah responded with tweets quoting Benedict\u2019s original 2007 law to relax the restrictions. His posts were accompanied by a photo of Benedict wearing the red cape that Francis had eschewed the night of his election.",
      "A year earlier, Sarah had orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading Benedict to co-author a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when Francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the Amazon. As the scandal grew, Benedict removed himself as a co-author.",
      "Sarah, 79, officially retired in 2021 but remains eligible to attend the conclave. Since the death of Francis on April 21, he has emerged as a favorite of European traditionalists who want to see a reversal of Francis\u2019 progressive policies.",
      "But in Africa, where Francis was widely loved for his engagement with the continent's crises, many Catholics simply want a pope who will be a faithful leader for everyone.",
      "\u201cFor us, it does not matter whether he is African, white, or Black. What matters is having a good, holy pope who can unite Catholics across the world,\u201d said Luka Lawrence Ndenge, an emergency officer with the Catholic charity Caritas in the remote town of Wau in South Sudan.",
      "The father of two said he believes an African can rise to the papacy, especially as \u201cwe already have African cardinals who are fully capable.\u201d",
      "Bishop Tesfaselassie Medhin, primate of Adigrat in the Ethiopian region of Tigray, said he hopes the next pope will be as compassionate as Francis, who repeatedly called attention to war in Tigray in 2021 and 2022.",
      "But the prospect of having a Black African pope is exciting, he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, having a passionate, dedicated and competent African leading the Catholic Church is very important to me as an African and to see it in my lifetime is my absolute wish,\u201d he said.",
      "Emily Mwaka doesn\u2019t like speculating about the next pope, especially on the color of his skin. So when the head of the Catholic laity in Kampala, Uganda, recently came upon a small group of Christians discussing a newspaper article about possible papal contenders \u2014 including some from Africa \u2014 she asked them to stop it.",

      "\u201cIt is uncertain where they can go to get help in the coming days,\u201d Chaudhury said. \u201cI have so many people come with questions on where they can go, but I have no answer.\u201d",

      "Two papal tailors and no conclave orders",
      "ROME -- Two papal tailors and no conclave orders.",
      "The conclave that begins next Wednesday to elect a successor for Pope Francis is the first in 46 \u00bd years for which the Vatican hasn't ordered a set of cassocks for the new head of the Catholic Church \u2014 at least from the two best-known papal tailors.",
      "That isn\u2019t stopping Ranieri Mancinelli, who opened his ecclesiastical tailoring shop near the Vatican in the 1960s, from making three simple white cassocks just in case: the traditional small, medium and large sizes to cover all possible heights and girths.",
      "\"I'm doing this on my own to be able to present these cassocks for the next pope, without knowing who he will be,\u201d Mancinelli said.",
      "Gammarelli, another family-run ecclesiastical tailor near the Pantheon in the historic center, has a paper trail showing it has received cassock orders for every conclave since the beginning of the 20th century \u2014 and probably far earlier. Gammarelli has been making garments for priests, bishops and cardinals since 1798.",
      "The last time no pre-conclave order came in to the Vatican's tailor of choice, Gammarelli, was October 1978, when cardinal electors voted a successor to Pope John Paul I, who died after 33 days as pontiff, said Lorenzo Gammarelli, representing the sixth generation of the family business.",
      "Gammarelli won't speculate why no order was made this year, but Italian media suggests the Vatican has enough unworn cassocks on hand, and is honoring Pope Francis\u2019 message of environmental and economic sustainability.",
      "\u201cObviously, we're a little sorry, because in the sadness caused by the death of the Holy Father, we still would have the beautiful thing of having to make the trousseau for the new one. Not this time,\" Gammarelli said.",
      "The Vatican declined to comment on what is being viewed as the great papal cassock race. \u201cI don\u2019t think I need to speak on behalf of businesses,\u201d said Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. \u201cNot every curiosity needs to be answered.\u201d",
      "For a pope\u2019s first encounter with the flock, the basic garment is the hand-stitched white wool cassock with white cape and wide silk sleeves. The cassock is fastened by silk buttons and worn with a silk brocade sash with gold fringe. All popes, until Francis, had this sash later embroidered with his papal seal.",
      "Francis also eschewed the classic burgundy red mozzetta, a short elbow-length cape worn for formal occasions, and a gold embroidered stole, not only the night of his election but throughout his papacy.",
      "The papal garb is finished with a white \u201czucchetto,\u201d or skullcap that is also worn by cardinals in red and bishops in purple.",
      "When they are called on to provide a conclave order, Gammarelli also provides shoes in an array of sizes so the new pope will be comfortable when presented to his flock. After that, Gammarelli said, \u201cshoes are a very personal matter.\"",
      "In keeping with the secrecy of the conclave, Gammarelli never reveals papal prices.",
      "While the world speculates on who will be the next pope, Gammarelli's job is more practical. The family has a system to best outfit the unknown successor, using data from their cardinal clients and sizing up cardinal candidates who are not.",
      "\"We consider who, in our opinion, could be elected,\" Gammarelli said. \"We pull out their measurements, and \u2026 we make three cassocks that would more or less fit all of them.\u2019\u2019",
      "Their best guesses are sometimes off.",
      "Gammarelli said they never imagined that Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyla would become pope in October 1978. They had considered Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio a candidate in 2005 (when Benedict XVI was elected) but not in 2013, when Bergoglio became the church\u2019s first Latin American pope.",
      "Back in 1958, the portly John XXIII appeared on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica with safety pins holding together the back of his cassock, after a too-small size was mistakenly grabbed, forcing aides to open the back.",
      "Gammarelli said that throughout Francis' 12-year papacy he tried to persuade the pope to wear white pants under his cassock. But Francis stuck with the black trousers of a priest, a reminder to himself and everyone that he was a pastor at heart.",
      "Mancinelli, at his shop just steps from the Vatican, has made cassocks for the last three popes: St. John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis.",
      "He got to know Benedict when he was a cardinal, living near Mancinelli\u2019s shop. Francis later invited him to his apartment in the Santa Marta residence, marking \u201cthe beginning of a very pleasant encounter period.\u201d",
      "While Gammarelli won't make the cassocks on speculation, Mancinelli is making three to give to the Vatican, in Francis\u2019 simple, unadorned style.",
      "\u201cCompared with the other two, Francis preferred much simpler and much more practical things,\" he said, also taking costs into account.",
      "Only after the words \u201cHabemus Papam!\u201d are announced from the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica will it be clear whether the Catholic Church\u2019s 267th pontiff will follow Francis\u2019s unembellished example or will bring back traditional papal trappings, like flashes of red.",

      "The major parties also differ on how to deal with China, which is both Australia\u2019s largest trading partner and its greatest strategic threat.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the main issues:",
      "Australians have endured one of the sharpest rises in the cost of living in recent history and the current government has been at the helm through the worst of it.",
      "Prices of eggs surged 11% last year and beer rose 4%, according to government figures. Average rents rose 4.8% last year after a 8.1% spike in 2023, property analyst CoreLogic said.",
      "The central bank\u2019s benchmark interest rate rose from a record low 0.1% to 0.35% two weeks before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party came to power in 2022's elections.",
      "The rate has been raised a dozen times since then, peaking at 4.35% in November 2023. Annual inflation peaked that year at 7.8%.",
      "The central bank reduced the inflation rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1% in an indication that the worst of the cost of living crisis had passed. The rate is widely expected to be cut again at the bank\u2019s next board meeting on May 20 due to international economic uncertainty generated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs policies.",
      "Inflation has put some builders out of business, exacerbating a shortage of housing, which in turn has inflated rents.",
      "The government has provided tax cuts and assistance for some rent and energy bills, but critics argue government spending has contributed to maintaining elevated inflation.",
      "Albanese promised in 2023 to build 1.2 million homes through incentives over five years starting in the middle of last year, an ambitious target in a country of 27 million people. Early building approval figures suggest his government would miss that target.",
      "Labor has vowed to reduce the deposit first time home buyers will be required to pay from 20% to 5% with the government becoming guarantor for the difference.",
      "The conservative opposition Liberal Party has promised to reduce competition for housing by reducing immigration. It\u2019s also promised to allow Australians to spend money held in their compulsory workplace pension funds, known as superannuation, on down payments to buy a home.",
      "The opposition has also pledged to make mortgage interest payments tax deductible for many first home buyers.",
      "Many economists argue the rival policies would both inflate home prices while achieving little to increase the supply of housing.",
      "Both parties agree on one goal: to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.",
      "Albanese's government was elected in 2022 with a promise to reduce Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade and achieve net zero by 2050.",
      "The opposition has promised to build seven government-funded nuclear power plants across Australia, the first providing electricity in 2035.",
      "The government argues Australia\u2018s existing coal and gas-fired generators won\u2019t last long enough to meet the nation\u2019s needs until nuclear power arrives. It plans to have 82% of Australia\u2019s energy grid powered by renewables by 2030.",
      "The opposition argues the government\u2019s policy of replacing coal and gas with renewable energy sources including wind turbines and solar cells is unachievable, and would reduce investment in clean energy technologies.",
      "The opposition would rely on more gas to generate electricity until atomic power was established. It would not set a new target for 2030 before the election.",
      "Trade and diplomatic relations between Australia and China plunged to new depths in 2020 after the previous conservative Australian government demanded an international inquiry into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Beijing barred minister-to-minister contacts with Australia and imposed a series of official and unofficial bans on commodities including coal, wine, barley, wood and lobsters that cost Australian exporters up to 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year.",
      "The thaw started almost immediately with the election of the Labor Party in 2022. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang wrote to congratulate Albanese on his election victory within days.",
      "All the trade barriers were gradually lifted and Albanese met President Xi Jinping during a state visit to Beijing in 2023.",
      "Albanese often says about China: \u201cWe will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must and engage in the national interest.\u201d",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton, a longtime critic of China, has claimed that bilateral relations would improve even further with a tough and uncompromising approach. He has accused Albanese of self-censorship to avoid offending Beijing.",
      "\u201cAustralia must be willing to criticize any nation whose behavior imperils stability in the region, and that\u2019s what a coalition government I lead will do confidently and in concert with like-minded countries,\u201d Dutton told the Lowy Institute international policy think tank in Sydney in March.",

      "General Motors is lowering one of its full-year financial forecasts as the company braces for the potential impact of auto tariffs",
      "General Motors is lowering its profit expectations for the year as the carmaker braces for the potential impact from auto tariffs being rolled out by the U.S.",
      "GM announced early this week that it was reassessing its expectations for 2025 due to tariffs. The company said at the time that its initial full-year financial outlook didn\u2019t contemplate their potential impact.",
      "On Thursday the automaker said that it now foresees full-year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in a range of $10 billion to $12.5 billion. The guidance includes a current tariff exposure of $4 billion to $5 billion.",
      "GM previously predicted 2025 adjusted EBIT between $13.7 billion and $15.7 billion.",
      "The revised forecast comes after President Donald Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, a significant reversal as the import taxes threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers.",
      "Automakers and independent analyses have indicated that the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide. Trump portrayed the changes as a bridge toward automakers moving more production into the United States.",
      "Still, it remains unclear what impact Trump\u2019s broader tariffs will have on the U.S. economy and auto sales. Most economists say the tariffs \u2014 which could ultimately hit most imports \u2014 would raise prices and slow economic growth, possibly hurting auto sales despite the relief that the administration intends to offer on its previous policies.",
      "In a letter to shareholders on Thursday, General Motors CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker looks forward to maintaining its strong dialogue with the Trump administration on trade and other evolving policies.",
      "\u201cAs you know, there are ongoing discussions with key trade partners that may also have an impact,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to be nimble and disciplined and update you as we know more.\u201d",
      "Shares of GM climbed more than 2% before the opening bell.",

      "The Trump administration is ending a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday.",
      "The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the U.S. every day \u2014 mostly from China \u2014 is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down.",
      "But some might actually benefit from the termination of the duty exemption. For instance, companies that make their goods in the U.S. may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook.",
      "The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on the U.S., fueling a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Sellers are already seeing cautious consumers.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called the de minimis exemption \u201ca big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe put an end to it,\u201d he said.",
      "Introduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold rose to $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can\u2019t avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the U.S. was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the deluge of parcels coming in.",
      "Consumers will face higher prices and delivery delays now that parcels will go through a more complicated customs process to enter the U.S. involving declaration and duty payment.",
      "Businesses could factor tariffs into the final price, or they can list them separately in the same way as sales taxes. For instance, Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, now lists \u201cimport charges\u201d that have reportedly doubled many items\u2019 prices. (The retailer also has a \u201clocal warehouse\u201d option for some products, which are shipped from within the U.S. and therefore avoids the import charge.)",
      "Meanwhile, Shein, now based in Singapore, has a checkout banner that reads, \u201cTariffs are included in the price you pay. You\u2019ll never have to pay extra at delivery.\u201d",
      "Amazon says it\u2019s not planning to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its site \u2014 despite a report that sparked speculation the e-commerce giant would soon show the new import charges, and the White House has made fiery comments denouncing the purported change.",

      "Major commercial carriers such as UPS and FedEx have said they are well-equipped and prepared to collect duties on international parcels in compliance with local laws, including the new U.S. rule.",
      "Commercial carriers will be collecting 145% tariffs on declared values. The U.S. Postal Service, a government agency that offers international mail service, can choose either to charge a 120% tariff on low-value packages or a flat fee of $100 per shipment, which is set to rise to $200 on June 1.",
      "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it \"stands ready to fully implement the restrictions on de minimis shipments and collect all revenue owed for these shipments on May 2, 2025.\u201d",

      "In January and February, more than 70% of the 216 million packages coming into the U.S. were originating from China, according to CBP.",
      "Those that relied on the de minimis exemption are now having to adjust.",
      "John Curry, owner and chief executive officer of HAPARI International, an Arizona-based swimwear business, had switched from bulk shipping to de minimis shipping about six months ago to improve cash flow, speed up delivery, and eventually eliminate U.S.-based warehousing. His company makes its products in China and sells them directly to U.S. customers via its own online storefront.",
      "Curry said he planned to stay the course and pay the additional 145% duty \u2014 one parcel at a time \u2014 while waiting for the U.S. and China to work out a more sustainable approach.",
      "\u201cThere has to be a solution because both countries cannot survive this way,\u201d Curry said.",
      "Izzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, helps businesses like HAPARI to ship goods from its China-based warehouse using the de minimis exemption. He says U.S. businesses are likely to stay in China for now given the competitiveness of the manufacturing base and of the supply chain in China but can be expected to raise prices.",
      "And while businesses with good profit margins probably will continue to ship from China, those that run on razor-thin profit margins are likely to \u201cgo local\u201d, setting up more U.S.-based warehouses to defray tariff costs, he said.",
      "Trade groups representing flag manufacturers and bike dealers said they expect to benefit from the end of the duty exemption.",
      "In written comments on the U.S. Trade Representative portal, for instance, the Flag Manufacturers Association of America said its members have been bombarded by an onslaught of American flag imports mostly made in China that are falsely marketed and significantly discounted. The group cited a drop of 25% to 35% in industrywide sales of American-made U.S. flags last year.",
      "Larry Severini, CEO of Embroidery Solutions Manufacturing LLC, which makes the star fields for U.S. flag manufacturers, had to shutter one of his two plants in South Carolina earlier this year because of stiff competition from cheap imports. He noted sales have fallen 20% since 2021 in part because of the de minimis exemption.",
      "\u201cWe need duties to level the playing field to make it fair,\u201d Severini said.",

      "\u201cReputable brands follow strict safety, labor, and warranty standards,\u201d she said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cDe minimis allowed bad actors to dodge these.\"",

      "Senate Democrats are forcing a vote on whether to block global tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier this month",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are forcing a vote Wednesday evening on whether to block global tariffs announced by Donald Trump earlier this month, a potentially tough vote for some Republicans who have expressed concerns about the policy but are wary of crossing the president.",
      "Trump announced the far-reaching tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners April 2 and then reversed himself a few days later after a market meltdown, suspending the import taxes for 90 days. Amid the uncertainty for both U.S. consumers and businesses, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first drop in three years.",
      "It is unclear whether the resolution will pass the Senate, and House passage is even less likely. But Democrats say they want to put Republicans on the record either way and try to reassert congressional powers.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cannot be an idle spectator in the tariff madness,\u201d said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the lead sponsor of the resolution.",
      "All 47 Senate Democrats are expected to support the resolution, which means they would need four Republican votes for passage. A similar resolution that would have thwarted Trump\u2019s ability to impose tariffs on Canada passed the Senate earlier this month with the support of Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. All but McConnell have indicated that they will vote for the broader resolution Wednesday.",
      "Wary of a rebuke to Trump, Republican leaders have encouraged their conference not to vote for the resolution, even as many of them remain wary of the tariffs. Vice President JD Vance attended a Senate GOP luncheon Tuesday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who assured senators that the administration is working on trade deals with individual countries.",
      "Republicans who have been skeptical of the tariffs said they won\u2019t vote with Democrats, arguing it is a political stunt. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he backs separate legislation by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley that would give Congress increased power over determining tariffs but would vote no on the resolution, which he said is only about \u201cmaking a point.\u201d",
      "Democrats say the Republicans\u2019 failure to stand up to Trump could have dire consequences. \u201cThe only thing Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have succeeded in is raising the odds of recession and sending markets into a tailspin,\u201d said Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cToday, they have to choose \u2013 stick with Trump or stand with your states.\u201d",
      "The Democratic resolution forces a vote under a statute that allows them to try to terminate the emergency that Trump declared in order to put the tariffs in place.",
      "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called it a \u201cfake\u201d emergency that Trump is using to impose his \u201con again, off again, red light, green light tariffs.\u201d",
      "The tariffs \u201care pushing our economy off a cliff,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The Republican president has tried to reassure a nervous country that his tariffs will not provoke a recession as his administration has focused on China. He told his Cabinet Wednesday morning that his tariffs meant China was \u201chaving tremendous difficulty because their factories are not doing business.\u201d",
      "Trump said the U.S. does not really need imports from the world\u2019s dominant manufacturer. \u201cMaybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.\u201d",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Ford Motor Company's top executive on Wednesday welcomed revisions to auto import rules but said more work is needed to craft trade policies that spur growth in the U.S. auto industry.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley touted his company's domestic production, saying it outpaces competitors, as he attended the rollout of the company's 2025 Expedition SUV at its massive truck plant in Kentucky.",
      "Farley focused on trade policies during his remarks to plant workers, a day after President Donald Trump signed executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.",
      "\u201cThe changes this week on tariff plans will help ease the impact of tariffs for automakers, suppliers and consumers,\u201d Farley said. \u201cBut this is what we really care about. We need to continue to work closely with the administration on a comprehensive set of policies to support our shared vision of that healthy and growing auto industry. And we are not there yet.\u201d",
      "Farley pointed to Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, which employs nearly 9,000 workers, as \u201ca shining example of American manufacturing.\u201d Ford has another auto production plant across town in Louisville. The venerable automaker opened the truck plant for a media tour Wednesday, showing off its synchronized assembly lines.",
      "Farley took aim at Ford's competitors in his speech, saying if they matched Ford's level of domestic production, it would be a boon for U.S. manufacturing and employment.",
      "\u201cMore than 80% of the vehicles Ford sells in America are assembled in America \u2014 plus we export significantly,\" he said. \"If each of our competitors matched that commitment, it would mean 4 million more vehicles assembled in America every single year.",
      "\u201cIf our competition matched Ford and moved auto assembly to the U.S., that would equal the production level of as many as 15 new assembly plants like this one \u2013 and that\u2019s not even counting the supplier parts to support them. That would mean hundreds of thousands of new jobs in America.\u201d",
      "While Ford touts its domestic production, the automaker continues to import vehicles and parts from Mexico as well as engines from Canada.",
      "Trump signed one order on Tuesday that amended his previous 25% auto tariffs, making it easier for vehicles that are assembled in the U.S. with foreign parts to avoid prohibitively high import taxes.",
      "The major car companies recently said sales rose sharply in March, with most reporting double-digit gains. For some companies, the strong performance helped make up for a sluggish start to the year. Some industry observers said the March numbers were expected to be higher due to some buying ahead of the anticipated imposition of tariffs.",
      "As discussions on trade and domestic production continue with Trump's administration, Farley called for policies that encourage exports and reward companies like Ford that export American-produced products.",
      "\u201cSo many of the vehicles we build here are exported around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we get credit for that? Those are American jobs. And we have to keep working on affordable parts to ensure that those supply chains promote domestic growth and affordable vehicles in our country.\u201d",
      "Ford also said Wednesday that it is extending its \u201cemployee pricing\u201d offer to vehicle buyers through the July 4th weekend. Farley said the offer has \u201cstruck a chord\u201d with consumers.",

Roughly half of U.S. adults say that President Trump's trade policies will increase prices \u201ca lot,\" according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center of Public Affairs Research. And about half of Americans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.",
      "Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial planning app, says it's a period of uncertainty for everyone, including experts.",
      "\u201cNo one has a crystal ball. No one, even the people that do this professionally and have done it very successfully for many years, know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.",
      "If you're worried about how economic uncertainty might affect you, here are some expert recommendations:",
      "The first step to preparing for uncertain financial times is knowing your starting point, Watson said. Look at your budget or your debit card expenses so you can understand how much you spend every month.",
      "\u201cTake stock of where you are across a number of different categories,\u201d Watson said.",
      "Looking at the state of your savings and investments can also provide you with an idea of your overall financial health.",
      "The more nonessential expenses you can pause, the more you can save for an emergency.",
      "\u201cYour choice is really to cut now or cut later, so it's easier to cut now and have a cushion,\u201d Watson said.",
      "If you're having difficulty finding where to cut back, Jim Weil, managing partner at Private Vista, a financial planning firm, recommends that you divide your expenses into three buckets: needs, wants and wishes. Wishes are larger expenses that can be postponed, such as a vacation to Europe.",
      "For the time being, cut back expenses from the wishes section until you feel like your finances are in a good place.",
      "Between news about tariffs and job losses, you might feel your anxiety rising. So, it's important that you protect your mental health while also caring about your finances, said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. Sometimes, reading too much news that can affect your finances can become overbearing and create more stress than you need.",
      "\u201cIt's good practice to stay informed but you don't want to let the news cycle consume you,\u201d Alev said.",
      "If you find yourself feeling high levels of stress or anxiety when it comes to your finances, it's best to contact a professional who can assist you, such as a financial therapist.",
      "If looking for regular mental health services, most health insurance covers some type of mental health assistance. If you don't have health insurance, you can look for sliding-scale therapists around the country, including through FindTreatment.gov and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America directory.",
      "Rather than worrying too much on the economics of the entire country, Alev recommends that you focus on the aspects of your personal life that you can control in order to feel more confident in case there is a recession.",
      "\u201cIdentify any changes that you might need to make to have more of a safety net in place that could give you confidence,\u201d Alev said.",
      "Things you can control include budgeting, creating an emergency fund and cutting unnecessary expenses.",
      "Whether you are worried about your job security or the high prices of goods, it's best that you sit down and reassess your budget to create an emergency fund. An emergency fund can feel unattainable if finances are already difficult, but having even a small amount of cash saved can make the difference, Alev said.",
      "Ideally, your emergency fund should amount to three to six months of expenses.",
      "Weil recommends you start thinking about any special commitments that you might have in the next year or two, such as college tuition or moving. If you are planning for a large financial commitment in the near future, Weil recommends that you plan to build a larger emergency fund.",
      "Alev recommends regularly adjusting your budget to keep your financial goals on track. Monthly budget check-ins can help identify when you are overspending or if your needs change.",
      "\u201cA budget is only as good as it is to help you actually make decisions, so don't be afraid to update and adapt your budget as the months go by,\u201d Alev said.",
      "Many Americans struggle with debt, whether it's credit card debt or student loan debt, which limits their ability to save. But, if you want to create an emergency fund while also tackling your debt, it will take some prioritization.",
      "\u201cI would think about different kinds of debt differently,\" Weil said, adding that you can place debt in three buckets: short-, medium- and long-term debt.",
      "Weil recommends that you prioritize paying off high-interest debt such as your credit card. By making extra payments or paying over the minimum payment, you will be able to pay it off quicker. Student loan debt and long-term debt such as a mortgage can be tackled with more modest payments while you focus on creating an emergency fund.",
      "If you have credit card debt and you can't make too much progress in paying it down, Alev recommends you try to eliminate or reduce the amount of credit you use.",
      "While the stock market has had some bad days, it's best that you are not reactive to the market. If you have investments, especially in retirement vehicles such as your 401(k), it's best not to make rushed decisions, Alev said.",
      "\u201cYou really want to try not to panic. It can be unnerving but most likely, you should have time to make that up,\u201d she added. If you're closer to retirement, Alev recommends that you look into more conservative investments.",

      "The government reported that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% during the first three months of the year. Behind the decline was a surge in imports as companies tried to front-run the sweeping tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and almost every country. And even positive signs of increased domestic consumption indicated that purchases might be occurring before the import taxes lead to price hikes.",
      "Trump pointed his finger at Biden as the stock market fell Wednesday morning in response to the gross domestic product report.",
      "\u201cThis is Biden\u2019s Stock Market, not Trump\u2019s,\u201d the Republican president, who took office in January, posted on his social media site. \u201cTariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers.

      "\u201cTrump has been in office for only 100 days, and costs, chaos and corruption are already on the rise,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. \u201cThe economy is slowing, prices are going up, and middle-class families are feeling the pinch.\u201d",
      "The report landed as Trump is trying to put the focus on new corporate investments in the U.S. as he spends the week celebrating his 100th day in office. He planned remarks later in the day on the subject.",
      "Trump's economic message contains some clashing arguments and dismisses data that raises red flags.",
      "He wants credit for an aggressive first 100 days back in the White House that included mass layoffs of federal workers and the start of a trade war with 145% in new tariffs against China. He also wants to blame the negative response of the financial markets on Biden, who left office months ago. He's also saying his tariffs are negotiating tools to generate trade deals but at the same time banking on hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff revenues to help cover his planned income tax cuts.",
      "Trump highlighted the positive aspects of the GDP report at a Wednesday Cabinet meeting. But that meeting inadvertently revealed how his administration is also trying to take credit for policies that involve the Biden administration as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick talked about his recent trip to Arizona to see the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s computer chip factories.",
      "TSMC notes on its website that it announced plans in May 2020, during Trump's first presidency as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the global economy, to build its first plant in Arizona.

      "NEW YORK -- Uncertainty continues to hang over the latest round of financial results and forecasts for companies both big and small as they try to navigate a global trade system severely shaken by a shift in U.S. policy.",
      "Tariffs and the stark shift in policy has also shaken consumer and business confidence. The U.S. economy shrank during the first quarter of the year, its first drop in three years. Consumer spending has ramped up, likely an effort to get ahead of tariffs, and companies are pulling back on hiring. Stunted consumer spending and weaker employment could further hurt the U.S. economy.",
      "Roughly half of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their latest quarterly financial results, but the focus has been on how they will adjust to tariffs and any change in consumers' behavior. The focus remains blurry for both companies and investors because of the on-again-off-again nature of President Donald Trump's policy",
      "Trump has implemented a range of tariffs on goods from some of the biggest U.S. trading partners and many of those countries have hit back with retaliatory tariffs. At the same time, Trump has pulled back or postponed some tariffs. The situation remains unpredictable and that is problematic for companies trying to plan ahead and investors looking for stability.",
      "Here's what companies are saying about tariffs and the potential impact:",
      "Caterpillar's latest profit and revenue results fell sharply from a year ago and they also missed Wall Street forecasts.",
      "The heavy machinery maker and industrial bellwether is among the many companies giving investors an uncertain forecast. Its equipment is used by the construction, mining and energy industries. Wall Street often uses Caterpillar's financial position and forecasts as a gauge for how well those industries are performing or will potentially perform in the quarter and year ahead.",
      "Without any impact from tariffs, the company expects sales and revenue in 2025 to match the prior year. With the current tariffs in place, sales and revenue are expected to dip slightly.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker said it raised prices in April and plans to raise prices again in the third quarter of the year as a reaction to tariffs.",
      "The maker of drills and other tools trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, based on the impact of tariffs and planned adjustments to its supply chain.",
      "\u201cIn light of the current environment, we are accelerating adjustments to our supply chain and exploring all options as we seek to minimize the impact of tariffs on end users while balancing the need to protect our business and our ability to innovate for years to come,\u201d said CEO Donald Allan, Jr., in a statement.",
      "Newell Brands has not changed its current financial forecast for the year, but warned that tariffs on China could take a big bite out of profits if they stand.",
      "The company makes ubiquitous consumer goods under brand names including Rubbermaid, Paper Mate and Coleman. It expects that tariffs on China, if they stand, to shave 20 cents per share from earnings. Newell Brands said it is already working on actions that could cut that impact in half.",
      "British bank Barclays saw its profit in the first-quarter of the year spike by a fifth largely as a result of a boom in trading activity sparked by the turmoil in financial markets following the array of tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Barclays said the 16% increase in income across its investment banking division to nearly 4 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) outweighed the hit to dealmaking from tariff and economic uncertainty. As a result. net profit rose 20% to 2.1 billion pounds.",
      "Still, the bank said it has set aside more cash for bad debts due to worries over the American economy as a result of the uncertainty. Barclays has an exposure to the tariff woes and U.S. economy through its sizable operations in America, where it has 20 million customers.",
      "CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan said the group remains \u201cvery committed\u201d to its U.S. business, despite the clouded outlook for the American economy.",

      "The company maintained its financial guidance for the year despite uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, with the Trump administration currently investigating whether to change tariff policy for the pharmaceuticals sector.",

      "Sysco cut its forecast for the year amid uncertainties over how tariffs will impact consumer spending.",
      "The food distributor purchases more than 90% of its products in each country that it operates within. That leaves it less exposed to tariff cost impacts than other industries, it said.",

      "Premium coffee roasters in the U.S. are reeling from the sharp price increases of coffee beans, which nearly doubled last year after record drought in Brazil",
      "ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- With her purple-and-pink hair swaying, Rene\u00e9 Col\u00f3n stands on a stepladder in the rented corner of a warehouse, pouring Brazilian coffee beans into her groaning old roasting machine.",
      "The beans are precious because they survived severe drought in a year when environmental conditions depressed coffee production globally, doubling the price of raw beans in just months.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, coffee is going to become more scarce,\u201d said Col\u00f3n, founder and roaster at Fuego Coffee Roasters. \u201cSeeing that dramatic loss of the Brazilian crop is a perfect example.\u201d",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and The Associated Press.",
      "___",
      "Losses from heat and drought have cut production forecasts in Brazil and Vietnam, the world's largest coffee growers. Global production is still expected to increase, but not as much as commodity market investors had expected. That's sent coffee prices up, largely because of continued high demand in Europe, the U.S., and China.",
      "Prices peaked in February but have remained high, forcing roasters like Col\u00f3n to weigh how much of that cost to absorb and how much to pass on to consumers.",
      "The beans Col\u00f3n was roasting cost her $5.50 per pound in early March, more than double what they cost in September. And that was for mixed, midrange beans. Specialty coffees \u2014 grown in delicate climates to slow growth and add flavor \u2014 can cost even more.",
      "President Donald Trump's current 10% tariffs cover most coffee-producing countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia and Colombia, and are expected to drive up costs for Americans. Amid his chaotic tariff pronouncements \u2014 at one point he threatened 46% tariffs on Vietnam imports and 32% on Indonesia imports before pausing them \u2014 American coffee roasters are rethinking their supply chains.",
      "\u201cWith all these changes in coffee maybe we should open our own damn farm,\u201d Col\u00f3n muses.",
      "Rural New York isn't an option, of course. The world\u2019s best coffee thrives near the equator, where seasons are long, and in high altitudes, where slow growing allows beans to gather flavor. But Puerto Rico, where Col\u00f3n and her husband have roots, isn't a serious option, either \u2014 labor costs are too high and she worries about the increasing risk of crop-damaging hurricanes.",
      "She shrugs off buying coffee from Hawaii and California, which she says is either poor quality, overpriced or both.",
      "In February, global coffee green exports were down 14.2% from a year earlier, according to the International Coffee Organization\u2019s market report. The shortage led to the highest price ever for raw coffee in February, breaking the record set in 1977 when severe frost wiped out 70% of Brazil\u2019s coffee plants.",
      "Climate isn\u2019t the only thing driving up prices, said Daria Whalen, a buyer for San Francisco-based Ritual Coffee Roasters. Inflation is driving up the cost of labor, fertilizers, and borrowing, she said.",
      "She described being in Mexico in April seeking to finalize contracts between Trump\u2019s fits and starts on tariffs. It reminded her of being in Colombia a month earlier as Trump threatened and then backed away from tariffs that would have affected coffee prices.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of like roller coaster day, because at the end of the day it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Whalen said.",
      "Some of the recent rise in coffee prices may be from importers buying extra in anticipation of the tariffs. Col\u00f3n believes prices will go still higher as import taxes begin being paid. And with consumer confidence hitting a 12-year low, Col\u00f3n could see a decrease in demand for her premium coffee.",
      "\u201cIt is tough on our end because it drives the price up, tough on the consumer end because they have to pay more and tough on the farmers' end because they may be experiencing really significant losses,\u201d Col\u00f3n said.",
      "Yet she's committed to expanding.",
      "In December, she and her husband took out a $50,000 loan to buy a custom coffee roaster from Turkey that will triple capacity. They\u2019re trying to increase sales by adding new wholesale clients like coffee shops, and selling directly to homes via a beans-of-the-month-style subscription service.",
      "The Col\u00f3ns have raised the wholesale price on a pound of roasted beans by 25 cents. They're considering doing the same for pour-overs and espresso drinks at their two retail locations.",
      "At one of those, called Melo, one couple said they don't look at the coffee's price on the receipt. For them, it's a treat.",
      "\u201cWe know we could go find coffee cheaper somewhere else,\u201d said Rob Newell, a high school biology teacher, as he held a cooing infant daughter alongside his wife, who is also a teacher. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just because we\u2019re new parents, but you get, like, cabin fever staying in the house all day.\u201d",
      "Col\u00f3n is also seeking to cut costs.",
      "The warehouse where she roasts has some extra space, so she's weighing stacking up more bags of raw beans there to save as much as $500 on monthly storage costs in port cities.",
      "She's tried to cultivate relationships with farmers to minimize price spikes and control bean quality. She described working with a farmer in Colombia as coffee prices were spiking in February to lock in a one-year contract that avoided the worst of the increase.",
      "And like many small business owners, she's had to get used to the complexity of tariffs.",
      "In January, she turned down a pitch from a Montreal coffee importer who suggested the U.S. dollar's strength in Canada would allow her to save money by importing through their warehouse. She feared that tariffs on Canada could increase prices. Plus, the coffee would have to cross an extra border, risking delays. And the value of the dollar has been up and down.",
      "\u201cI want things to be less complicated instead of more,\" she said.",

      "The explosion that rocked an Iranian port had its epicenter at a facility ultimately owned by a charitable foundation overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s office",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The explosion that rocked an Iranian port, killing at least 70 people and injuring more than 1,000 others, had its epicenter at a facility ultimately owned by a charitable foundation overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office.",
      "That foundation, known as Bonyad Mostazafan, faces American sanctions over it helping the 86-year-old Khamenei \u201cto enrich his office, reward his political allies and persecute the regime\u2019s enemies,\u201d the U.S. Treasury has said. Its top personnel also have direct ties to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees Tehran's ballistic missile arsenal and operations abroad targeting the Islamic Republic's enemies.",
      "Those associations come as authorities still haven't offered a cause for the blast Saturday at the Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas. The port reportedly took in a chemical component needed for solid fuel for ballistic missiles \u2014 something denied by authorities though local reports now increasingly point toward a mysterious, highly explosive cargo being delivered there.",
      "\u201cIt's known that Iran has been doing all kinds of sanctions busting and so on in order to supply their weapons program,\u201d said Andrea Sella, a professor of chemistry at the University College London. \u201cThe surprising thing is the fact that this cargo, given that it's a highly energetic material ... was sitting right in the middle of the port warehousing area.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThat strikes me as nuts.\u201d",
      "A bonyad, the Farsi word for \u201cfoundation,\u201d wields tremendous power in Iran. The bonyads take their root in foundations set up by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi during his rule.",
      "After the 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled the shah, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini set up the bonyads to manage those assets, as well as companies seized from supporters of the shah and religious minorities, like the Baha\u2019i and Jews.",
      "Bonyad Mostazafan, or the \u201cFoundation of the Oppressed,\u201d is believed to be the largest in the country by assets, with a 2008 U.S. Congressional Research Service report suggesting it represented 10% of Iran's entire gross domestic product at the time. The Treasury in 2020 put its worth into the billions of dollars. Its network includes interests in mining, railroads, energy, steel and shipping through its Sina Port and Marine Services Development Co.",
      "Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show the epicenter of Saturday's explosion struck just next to Sina's terminal at the port, shredding the facility and the containers stacked nearby.",
      "Late Sunday, Iran\u2019s semiofficial ILNA news agency quoted Saeed Jafari, the CEO of Sina, as saying there had been false statements about the cargo that detonated, which he called \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe incident happened following a false statement about the dangerous goods and delivering it without documents and tags,\u201d Jafari said. He didn't elaborate and access to the site has been restricted by authorities since the blast.",
      "Since its creation, Bonyard Mostazafan has been linked to the Guard. Its current president, Hossein Dehghan, reached the rank of general in the Guard and serves as a military adviser to Khamenei. Other leaders in the foundation's history have had direct and indirect ties back to the Guard.",
      "The U.S. Treasury separately describes the foundation as having business relationships or cash transactions with the country's police, the Defense Ministry and the Guard as well.",
      "\u201cMostazafan has de-facto been functioning as the IRGC\u2019s \u2018money box,\u2019 whereby its financial assets and resources are made available to senior IRGC commanders, not least to fund terrorist activities,\u201d alleges United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based pressure group, using an acronym for the Guard.",
      "In sanctioning Bonyad Mostazafan in 2020, the first Trump administration described the foundation as being used by Khamenei to \u201cline the pockets of his allies.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite its outsized influence in the Iranian economy, Bonyad Mostazafan operates outside of government oversight and, due to a 1993 decree by the Supreme Leader, is exempt from paying taxes on its multibillion-dollar earnings,\u201d the U.S. Treasury said. The foundation says its affiliated companies pay taxes.",
      "On Tuesday, the Treasury issued new sanctions on China and Iran over the transshipment of sodium perchlorate and dioctyl sebacate to the Islamic Republic. Sodium perchlorate is used to produce ammonium perchlorate, a key ingredient to make solid fuel for ballistic missiles. The Treasury identified one individual from an Iranian firm as being linked to the Guard.",
      "The Financial Times in January first reported that two loads of sodium perchlorate were coming to Iran from China. Tracking data showed that one of the ships identified as carrying the load was near Shahid Rajaei in recent weeks. The private security firm Ambrey separately said that the port received the sodium perchlorate, which is described as a white, sand-like solid.",
      "Iranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaeinik denied earlier this week that missile fuel had been imported through the port. Iranian Cabinet spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani separately described the explosion Wednesday as coming from \"human error, probably.\u201d",
      "However, no official in Iran has offered any explanation for what material detonated with such incredible force at the site.",
      "A reddish cloud could be seen in surveillance camera footage before the blast Saturday. That suggests a chemical compound like ammonia being involved in the blast, like the 2020 Beirut port explosion, in which ammonium nitrate caught fire and exploded.",
      "That cloud also resembled one seen in footage from a 1988 massive explosion in Nevada at the PEPCON plant that killed two people and injured hundreds. PEPCON, or the Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada, made rocket fuel for NASA and had accumulated ammonium perchlorate that went unused after the Challenger disaster, leading to the blast.",
      "Similar reddish smoke could be seen just before a 2013 explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant filled with ammonium nitrate that killed 15 people.",
      "Sella, the chemistry professor, said the reddish cloud likely was nitrogen dioxide, which can be produced when burning ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate. However, the reports about the missile fuel shipment suggests it was ammonium perchlorate, he said.",

      "The official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to a 16-month low of 49.0 from 50.5 in March. That\u2019s on a scale where 50 marks the break between expansion and contraction. A private survey by the financial information group Caixin fell to 50.4 from 51.2.",
      "\u201cThe sharp drop in the PMIs likely overstates the impact of tariffs due to negative sentiment effects, but it still suggests that China\u2019s economy is coming under pressure as external demand cools,\u201d Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",

      "Romanians are preparing to cast their ballots in a critical presidential vote redo after last year\u2019s election was annulled",
      "SASCHIZ, Romania -- In a picturesque village in central Romania, 83-year-old Zoica Roth bemoans the lack of opportunities for young people and says she's not convinced that an upcoming presidential election can help stem the desertion of the countryside.",
      "\u201cI have two girls and two boys. I only see them once in the summer and once at Christmas because they\u2019re all abroad,\u201d she told The Associated Press in the courtyard of her farmstead in Saschiz, in Mures county. \u201cThe only solution is to leave ... I miss them.\u201d",
      "Anger toward Romania\u2019s political establishment in recent years has fueled a surge in support for far-right figures in the European Union and NATO member country, reflecting a broader pattern seen across Europe.",
      "In last year\u2019s election, the far-right front-runner Calin Georgescu \u2014 who is now under investigation and is barred from the rerun \u2014 won strong support among rural communities as well as 43% of the vote in Romania\u2019s large diaspora, with his calls to patriotism and emphasis on faith resonating.",
      "Georgescu\u2019s policy proposals included supporting local farmers, reducing import dependence, and ramping up domestic energy and food production. \u201cHe was a good one,\u201d Roth said, adding that a top court\u2019s decision to cancel the election on Dec. 6 was \u201cpretty messed up.\u201d",
      "She also feels let down by the choice of the 11 candidates in Sunday's election rerun. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to choose from, they\u2019re all the same,\" she added.",
      "A communist country until 1989, development across rural Romania has lagged behind that of cities. In a country of about 19 million people, some 45% of Romanians live in the countryside, which often lacks jobs and basic infrastructure.",
      "After joining the EU in 2007, millions of Romanians \u2014 including Roth's family \u2014 moved abroad in search of better opportunities, tearing apart countless families. Like many older generation Romanians, Roth now fondly remembers life during communism.",
      "\u201cIt was good back then, we had places to work, we had jobs,\u201d Roth said. \u201cNow I have my pension, but the young ones coming up have no jobs, nowhere to work. They leave with their bags on their backs \u2026 to foreign countries.\u201d",
      "Monica Rosalea, 41, works the land at home in Saschiz to make ends meet and periodically works in Germany.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard because there\u2019s no work \u2026 we all go abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have children, how are we supposed to raise them? We\u2019re forced to leave them at home. The little money you bring from abroad, you spend it all here \u2026 everything is so expensive.\u201d",
      "Rosalea voted for Georgescu last year. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose him alone \u2026 everyone voted for him. But then look what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know who I\u2019d vote for now. There are no real options.\u201d",
      "In 2023, employment in Romania's rural areas was the lowest in the EU, with just 61% of working-age people in work, according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency Eurostat. Over the past decade, youth unemployment has fallen across most of the EU, but it has also risen in Romania\u2019s rural areas.",
      "For 23-year-old Alexandra Todea, who works as a logistics administrator at a local preserves factory in Saschiz, Georgescu\u2019s messages resonated because he saw the \u201cpotential of rural areas,\u201d which offered people hope that things could improve.",
      "\u201cIf the Romanian state supported us young people more \u2026 then there would be no need to leave and go to another country to make something of ourselves,\" she said. \"We do have potential, it\u2019s just that no one invests.\u201d",
      "Like many Romanians for whom Georgescu\u2019s messages struck a chord, Todea questions the legitimacy of cancelling the election and feels robbed of her previous vote. \u201cUnfortunately, that right was taken from me,\u201d she added.",
      "Her colleague, Aliz Alamorean, 23, bucked the trend by moving back to Romania this year after living in Spain since she was five. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like a stranger, but I didn\u2019t feel at home either,\u201d she said, adding she would vote for Georgescu if he were allowed to run again.",
      "\u201cThe same people always have to win, and when they saw the \u2018wrong\u2019 one was winning \u2014 they canceled it,\u201d she said, listing the economy as her main concern. \u201cIf I see it\u2019s not working out, I\u2019ll pack my bags and go back,\u201d she added.",
      "Life in rural Romania is often shaped by traditions, faith, and community ties \u2014 but the challenges are stark. A lack of opportunities, underdeveloped schools, and poor access to healthcare can deepen a sense of abandonment by the political class.",
      "A week after the Nov. 24 presidential first round, Alamorean voted for the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, in a parliamentary election. AUR proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom,\" and doubled its support.",
      "The party's leader, George Simion, came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu, and is widely viewed as his successor in the upcoming ballot. A median of polls suggests he will enter a runoff on May 18.",
      "Across the countryside, many Romanians still work the land tending to their crops and animals. But in rural communities \u2014 where 90% of households rely on firewood to heat their homes \u2014 not everyone will exercise their right to vote.",
      "\u201cI only have three years of school,\u201d said shepherd Attila Agostun, 46, who has never voted, as he watched over his flock grazing the verdant pastures near the village of Cund. \u201cAll my life has been with animals \u2026 that\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d",
      "The risk of poverty or social exclusion in Romania\u2019s rural communities is 45%, 26 percentage points higher than in cities, according to Eurostat.",
      "However, the Orthodox Church plays a central role in rural communities and offers hope.",
      "In the remote village of Floresti on a bright spring day, birdsong fills the courtyard of Liliana Cosurean, 54, as she lays out a spread of local cheese and homemade jam. She says she is happy living among forests and rolling hills, which she calls \u201ca little corner of paradise,\u201d where slow tourism has brought some positive change.",
      "But she acknowledges that the recent political turmoil has divided people. \u201cThere seems to be a certain tension in the air, and I hope it settles down for the sake of the young people,\u201d she said. \u201cI sincerely hope things will remain peaceful and won\u2019t fall apart.\u201d",
      "She did not want to say who she voted for in the previous race, and isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019ll vote on Sunday. She described Georgescu as \u201ca man with a kind heart and a fear of God,\u201d and believes he inspired trust because he spoke openly about faith.",
      "\u201cThat might be the thing that could unite us,\u201d she said. \u201cFaith can move mountains \u2026 a person who has faith can do anything.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The new chief executive of California\u2019s embattled high-speed rail project says it is time to get serious about how to pay for it",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A long-delayed project promising nonstop rail service between San Francisco and Los Angeles in under three hours may be able to secure the private funding it desperately needs if California agrees to pay the investors back, its chief executive told The Associated Press.",
      "Ian Choudri, who was appointed CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority in August, is tasked with reinvigorating the nation's largest infrastructure project amid skyrocketing costs and new fears that the Trump administration could pull $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "\u201cWe started this one, and we are not succeeding,\u201d Choudri said, describing what drew him to the job after work on high-speed systems in Europe. \u201cThat was the main reason for me to say, let\u2019s go in, completely turn it around, and put it back to where it should have been. Fix all the issues, get the funding stabilized, and demonstrate to the rest of the world that when we decide that we want to do it, we actually will do it.\u201d",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 to cover about a third of the estimated cost with a promise the train would be up and running by 2020. Five years past that deadline, no tracks have been laid and Choudri acknowledges it may take nearly two more decades to complete most of the San Francisco-to-Los Angeles segment, even if funding is secured.",
      "The project's price tag now exceeds $100 billion, more than triple the initial estimate. It has mostly been funded by the state through the voter-approved bond and money from the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program. A little less than a quarter of the money has come from the federal government.",
      "The authority has already spent about $13 billion. The state is now out of bond money, and officials need to come up with a financing plan for the Central Valley segment by mid-2026, according to the inspector general\u2019s office overseeing the project.",
      "\u201cThe managers of the project were in trouble from the very beginning because they never had the financing \u2013 certainly not stable and predicting financing \u2014 that they would have needed to manage the project efficiently,\u201d said Lou Thompson, who led a peer review group that analyzes the state\u2019s high-speed rail plans.",
      "Losing money from the federal government \u201cwould require a real hard rethinking of what do we do to survive the next four years,\u201d he said.",
      "Rail leaders are in talks with Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration and state lawmakers on what will be needed to secure private investment, Choudri said, adding that without the private sector money the state may have to take out federal loans or issue new bonds. At an industry forum in January, private investors expressed interest in the project but need some form of security, he said.",
      "Choudri is pushing Newsom and lawmakers to consider a program that would eventually commit the state to paying back private investors, possibly with interest. That would give the state more time to cover the cost.",
      "Legislative Democrats say they remain hopeful for the project\u2019s future. But they haven\u2019t unveiled any proposals yet this year in the state Legislature to set aside additional funding and have resisted spending more money on the project in the past.",
      "Choudri plans to provide lawmakers this summer with an updated timeline and price tag.",
      "Choudri aims to fulfill the original vision of building a pioneering system \u2014 already common in Europe and Asia \u2014 that spurs economic growth, curbs planet-warming emissions from cars and planes, and saves drivers hours on the road.",
      "At speeds up to 220 miles (354 kilometers) per hour, it would be the nation's fastest way to travel by ground.",
      "Amtrak\u2019s Acela train transports passengers at speeds up to 150 miles (241 kilometers) per hour to major cities including New York, Boston and Philadelphia. Another rail line in Florida operating at speeds up to 125 miles (201 kilometers) per hour shuttles people from Orlando to Miami.",
      "Construction is underway for a mostly privately funded high-speed system to carry riders from Las Vegas to Southern California.",
      "California's construction is far from completion. Of the 119 miles (192 kilometers) of construction underway in the Central Valley, only a 22-mile (35-kilometer) stretch is ready for the track-laying phase, which isn\u2019t set to start until next year.",
      "Finishing the line in the Valley is just the first step. Next, the train has to extend north toward the San Francisco Bay Area and south toward Los Angeles. Choudri's goal is to build to Gilroy, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. Under current public transit, it would then take at least one more train transfer to get into the city.",
      "Southward, he envisions building to Palmdale, 37 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles. From there, it takes more than one hour to drive or two hours on an existing train line to reach Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cIn the ideal world, you can take the 500 miles, build it in your warehouse and then just drop it and everybody\u2019s happy,\" Choudri said. \u201cBut the programs are never built like that. You build incrementally and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d",
      "Critics say the project will never be completed and may leave towering and unusable infrastructure stretching through the state's agricultural heartland. More than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from existing roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve now spent billions of dollars and really no tracks have been laid,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland, who is vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee.",
      "Doug Verboon, chair of the Kings County Board of Supervisors, who has fought the High-Speed Rail Authority in court over farmers' loss of land due to the project, said the people who should be most upset by delays are its longtime supporters.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me like the state government is in a hurry to finish it,\" he said.",

      "Kyle Busch was hyped for NASCAR greatness long before he was a teenager by his Hall of Fame nominee brother, who vowed \u201cif you think I\u2019m good, wait until you see my little brother.\u201d",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Kyle Busch was hyped for NASCAR greatness long before he was a teenager by his Hall of Fame nominee brother, who vowed \u201cif you think I\u2019m good, wait until you see my little brother.\u201d",
      "Busch's debut in a NASCAR national series race was delayed, though, when he turned up at California Speedway in 2001 intent to run the Truck Series race. He dominated practice in a race sponsored by Marlboro but, because he was only 16 at the time, was ruled ineligible to compete over NASCAR's interpretation of the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.",
      "The MSA prohibited individuals under 18 from participating in events sponsored by tobacco companies. And because NASCAR at the time was sponsored by Winston, the series eventually adopted its own rule six weeks later implementing a minimum age requirement of 18 that began in 2002.",
      "Busch had no choice but to move to the American Speed Association National Tour, and then ARCA after graduating early from his Las Vegas high school.",
      "Fast-forward to Friday when Busch celebrates his 40th birthday as a two-time Cup Series champion headed to Texas Motor Speedway with 232 national series victories. Kurt Busch, his older brother by seven years and a nominee last week to next year's Hall of Fame class, has one Cup title and 43 career national series victories.",
      "Busch can now laugh at his experience 24 years ago at California Speedway, where he went on to win five Cup races, including the last one in 2023 before the track was shuttered by NASCAR.",
      "\u201cShut that place down,\u201d he said, noting the irony that he's now sponsored by zone nicotine pouches, which has an additional relationship with online retailer Nicokick. \u201cFull circle moment.\u201d",
      "Busch celebrated his birthday early \u2014 over the Easter weekend, which was NASCAR's only break of the 38-race schedule \u2014 with a vacation with wife, Samantha. They left their two children home and Samantha made a heartfelt social media post honoring her husband.",
      "\u201cEarly celebration for Kyle\u2019s big 4-0, love ya babe,\u201d Samantha wrote, sharing a picture of herself and her husband at dinner on a beachfront. In a separate image, Kyle could also be seen with a small chocolate cake in front of him with a candle burning.",
      "Busch said he and Samantha \u201cmade the most of it\u201d even though he finds it difficult to unwind.",
      "\u201cJust a nice little quiet time, tried to disconnect, that's not easy for me to do,\u201d Busch said. \u201cSo I'm still kind of doing some work from afar, emails and things like that.\u201d",
      "And as for turning 40? Well, he wasn't exactly thrilled. Busch is in his 23rd season in the Cup Series, and although he joined Richard Childress Racing in 2023 and won three races, he went winless in Cup last year for the first time in his career and missed the playoffs. His losing streak headed to Texas is an eye-popping 67 races.",
      "\u201cI remember turning 30 and thinking that was going to be it,\u201d Busch said. \u201cIt is what it is. Samantha has made the best of that for me where we celebrated my birthday on that trip. I don't feel much older than I did five, six years ago. So that's the good part of it. And I'm in pretty decent shape, so thankful for all of that.\u201d",
      "Busch briefly considered retirement at the end of the 2022 season when he parted ways with Joe Gibbs Racing, where he for now is the winningest driver in team history with Denny Hamlin closing in on his mark. Now, he'd like to race at least until his son, Brexton, turns 18 and the two can compete against each other in NASCAR.",

      "Alex and Maia Shibutani are making a comeback with an eye on competing for the U.S. figure skating team at next year's Milan-Cortina Olympics",
      "The Shib Sibs are making a comeback with an eye on more Olympic figure skating medals.",
      "The popular brother-sister ice dance team of Alex and Maia Shibutani announced Thursday they will return to competition this season in the hopes of making the loaded American squad for the next year's Milan-Cortina Games.",
      "The 34-year-old Alex and the 30-year-old Maia have skated together most of their lives, and for a long stretch were the dominant U.S. ice dancers. They are three-time world medalists and two-time Olympians, finishing ninth at the 2014 Sochi Games and third at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, where they also were part of the American squad that won a team bronze medal.",
      "The Shibutanis stepped away from competition after those Olympics, choosing to focus on school and other interests. They have authored four children's books and worked as choreographers and ambassadors for diversity and representation.",
      "They extended their hiatus when Maia Shibutani was diagnosed with a malignant tumor on her kidney in 2019. She underwent surgery to remove the mass, and additional treatment resulted in a long, painful recovery.",
      "\u201cThese past seven years have challenged and inspired us in ways we never expected,\" Maia Shibutani said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy and grateful to be healthy and in a position to make the decision to return to the sport I love in this way.\u201d",
      "The Shibutanis continued to skate in exhibitions over the years, and they remained close to the Olympic movement, albeit in a different way. Last summer, Alex Shibutani worked as a photographer and Maia Shibutani did media work at the Paris Olympics, where U.S. figure skaters were finally awarded their team gold medals from the 2022 Beijing Games.",
      "Now, the Shibutanis hope to be on the next American squad headed to the Olympics.",
      "They will be training with longtime coach Marina Zoueva and Massimo Scali, who recently helped Alysa Liu return from her own brief retirement to win the first women's world title for a U.S. figure skater in nearly two decades.",
      "It won't be easy for the Shibutanis to make the team for the Milano-Cortina Games. Madison Chock and Evan Bates just won their third consecutive ice dance world title and will be prohibitive favorites to stand atop the Olympic podium, while Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko were fifth at worlds and Caroline Green and Michael Parsons were ninth.",
      "The U.S. has qualified the maximum three ice dance teams for the Winter Games, which means someone will be left out.",
      "\u201cAs Olympic medalists and U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Famers, it\u2019s incredibly exciting to have Maia and Alex return to competition next season,\u201d said Justin Dillon, the senior director of athlete high performance for U.S. Figure Skating.",
      "\u201cThey are strong ambassadors for the sport, both on and off the ice. Their comeback adds to the excitement surrounding Team USA after a very successful year and makes the team stronger as we look toward the Olympic season.\u201d",

      "The Golden State Warriors missed a chance to clinch the best-of-seven series on the road, and they gave some momentum right back to the Rockets as red-hot Houston ran away for a 131-116 victory to stave off elimination",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- With his team trailing by 27 points to the red-hot Houston Rockets at halftime, coach Steve Kerr pulled Golden State emotional leader Draymond Green aside for a quick chat and to ask his opinion.",
      "Should the Warriors plan to save their starters for what looked like an inevitable Game 6 in two days if things became any more out of hand after intermission? Green suggested Kerr should give the group five more minutes to see what could be done on the deficit.",
      "It only got worse. And Kerr sent in the backups with 5:50 left in the third quarter of an embarrassing 131-116 loss Wednesday night so his Warriors can turn their attention at trying again to close out the first-round series back home Friday night.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to chase this game obviously with Game 6 coming up in 48 hours,\" Kerr said. \"So I talked to Draymond. I said, \u2018What do you think?\u2019 He said five minutes, so we gave the starting group the first five or six minutes and unless we had made a huge run kind of had it in mind that we would pull the plug.\u201d",
      "The Warriors missed a chance to clinch the best-of-seven series on the road, and they gave some momentum right back to the Rockets. Golden State leads 3-2.",
      "Jimmy Butler, Stephen Curry and Green will need to forget their Game 5 blowout fast and now count on their experience in big games as they return to Chase Center to get past second-seeded Houston, which staved off elimination with a dominant performance.",
      "\u201cWe're fine. Our confidence isn't going to waiver,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe're going to start out better and play a better overall game.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota Timberwolves are waiting for the winner to begin the Western Conference semifinals. While the Warriors couldn\u2019t close their series on the road with a 3-1 lead, Rudy Gobert led the way as Minneapolis ended the season for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 103-96.",
      "And given the blowout, the Golden State starters should be plenty fresh \u2014 Rockets coach Ime Udoka re-inserted his core group with the lead dwindling. Curry played 23 minutes, Butler 25 and Green nearly 18. Fred VanVleet scored 26 points on 8-for-13 shooting with four 3-pointers playing 33 minutes to lead Houston as all five starters reached double figures.",
      "The Rockets jumped to a big lead from the opening tip for a runaway win. Their 131 points were their most ever in a playoff game against Golden State.",
      "Houston had averaged 98 points per game through the first four of the series, then went off in the win that included an early 18-0 run and a 31-point lead in the second half before the Warriors' second unit chipped away.",
      "\u201cLoved our bench group, they came in and they forced Houston to bring their starters back in. They set a tone that we're going to need for Game 6,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cEven though we lost the game I thought it was crucial that we fought the way we did in the fourth quarter.\u201d",
      "The past two games became testy, with Golden State's reserves getting involved during Game 5 when Pat Spencer got ejected for head-butting Alperen Sengun before Trace Jackson-Davis shoved the Rockets big man.",
      "It was Curry, Green and Dillon Brooks in Game 4, yet Brooks believes Houston's youngsters are learning with each experience on the big NBA stage.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sticking to the details of the playoffs,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cEvery possession matters, every loose ball, rebound, shot we take, it matters. And there\u2019s nothing to get worked up or get tight about. It\u2019s just understanding that you can\u2019t turn the ball over and you need possessions, we need good possessions. And I feel like the young guys are learning how to leave their imprint on the game.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 6, Friday, 9 p.m. EDT (ESPN)",
      "Series: Warriors lead 3-2.",
      "BetMGM Sportsbook: Warriors by 4.5.",
      "What to Know: Foul trouble and free-throw differential have been common themes in this series, with Golden State the culprit in Game 5. The Warriors had 27 fouls and the Rockets converted 32 of 38 free throws \u2014 8 of 8 by Brooks, 6 of 6 by VanVleet, and 8 of 9 for Amen Thompson. The Rockets also played a clean game with just 12 turnovers while Kerr has stressed taking care of the ball so many time this season and the Warriors committed 15 turnovers for 20 Houston points. And Golden State's defense will have to do something different against VanVleet, who along with his fellow starters had to return to the game when the Warriors reserves made a run and finished with a playoff franchise-record 76 bench points. Kerr chose to keep his veteran stars of Butler, Curry and Green on the bench to end the game and get them ready for Friday.",

      "The Football Association said it had decided to change its rules that had allowed transgender athletes to play on women's soccer if they had reduced testosterone levels. The Scottish Football Association made a similar decision last week.",
      "The U.K's highest court issued a ruling two weeks ago that defined a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female. The head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said after the ruling that transgender women would be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "While the ruling was cheered by some feminist groups, it has been condemned by trans-rights groups who said it would have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.",
      "The FA said its policy had been to make the sport accessible to as many people as possible but that it would make alterations if there were changes in law, science or the operations of \u201cgrassroots football.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify, and we are contacting the registered transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can continue to stay involved in the game,\u201d the FA said in a statement.",
      "It was not clear how many players would be affected by the policy that would take effect June 1.",

      "LeBron James wasn\u2019t ready to make any decisions about his future in the painful moments immediately after his 22nd NBA season ended with the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 first-round playoff exit",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James wasn't ready to make any decisions about his future in the painful moments immediately after his 22nd NBA season ended with the Los Angeles Lakers' first-round playoff exit.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the answer to that,\u201d James said Wednesday night when asked how long he will continue to play. \u201cSomething I\u2019ll sit down with my wife and my support group and kind of just talk through it, and see what happens. Just have conversations with myself on how long I want to continue to play. I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now, to be honest.\u201d",
      "The 40-year-old James has given no public indication he is thinking about retirement this summer, but Lakers fans will be holding their breath until the top scorer in NBA history makes his plans official.",
      "James provided no hints after recording 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the Lakers' 103-96 loss to Minnesota.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to me if I\u2019m going to continue to play, or how long I\u2019m going to continue to play,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately up to me, so it has nothing to do with anybody else.\"",
      "Most observers think the four-time champion is planning to return for a 23rd season, which would break the NBA longevity record he currently shares with Vince Carter. He is also just 49 regular-season games behind Robert Parish, who holds the NBA record with 1,611 games played. James already holds the league record for career playoff games with 292.",
      "But his seventh season with the Lakers is over after the Timberwolves' 4-1 series victory. Los Angeles didn't build a winning dynamic quickly enough to the midseason arrival of Luka Doncic in a seismic trade for Anthony Davis.",
      "James' Lakers have advanced in the postseason just once in the five years since their championship in the Florida bubble \u2014 but if James returns, he's coming back to a completely reconfigured team built around his new partnership with Doncic.",
      "James and Doncic played only 21 games together after the deal, and it wasn't enough to maximize their potential teamwork. Another full year together could raise their partnership to formidable levels, and James still seems intrigued by the prospect of playing a full year or more alongside the Slovenian superstar he has described as his favorite active player.",
      "\u201cAnytime you make a big acquisition in the middle of the season, it\u2019s always going to be challenging, not only for me, but for (Austin Reaves) and the rest of the group,\u201d James said. \u201cThere were times where we obviously didn\u2019t look so well, but I think we kind of figured it out later in the season, the more games we had. I still don\u2019t think we had enough time to mesh, but for the time that we had, I thought we ended the regular season very well to be top three in the West.\u201d",
      "Doncic isn't the only teammate who could compel James to return: His 20-year-old son, Bronny, is coming off a surprisingly solid rookie season with the Lakers in which they became the first father and son to play together in NBA history.",
      "Bronny James is hoping to carve out a bigger role alongside his father next season after getting sporadic playing time this year. LeBron said the chance to work alongside Bronny this season was the \u201cNo. 1\u201d accomplishment of his career.",
      "There are no apparent contractual or financial issues in James' way: He has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. That\u2019s serious money to leave on the table, even for a business mogul with a net worth estimated at more than $1 billion.",
      "An eighth consecutive season with the Lakers would be the longest stretch of his career with one team, surpassing his first seven seasons with Cleveland \u2014 although he returned for four more years and a championship with the Cavaliers.",
      "James' level of play remained high in his 22nd season, confounding all previous notions of basketball longevity. He averaged 24.4 points per game \u2014 his lowest since his rookie season, but just barely \u2014 along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds.",
      "James remained the Lakers' heart while they won 52 games and the Pacific Division title despite the midseason roster upheaval. Every significant contributor on this season's roster is under contract for 2025-26 except for Dorian Finney-Smith, who has a $15.3 million player option, and inconsistent center Jaxson Hayes.",
      "In a moment of reflection near his 40th birthday last December, James speculated that he could continue to play at this level for five to seven more years. He doesn't intend to stick around that long, however.",

      "PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Mercury will open their first season in 21 years without Diana Taurasi. She's busy at home enjoying the first few months of retirement.",
      "There's also no Brittney Griner for the first time since 2012. The game-changing center is now wearing an Atlanta Dream uniform.",
      "Two of the greatest players of their generation are gone, sending the Mercury into an uncharted new era.",
      "\u201cI came here with a lot of new faces, a lot of hungry people,\u201d new Mercury forward Alyssa Thomas said Wednesday during the team's media day. \u201cIt's just going to be fun to be part of an organization that\u2019s known for winning has multiple championships and, just overall, has been the top of this thing for a long time.\u201d",
      "The Mercury had a good run with Taurasi and Griner.",
      "Taurasi staked her claim as one of the greatest players in women's basketball history since the Mercury selected her with the No. 1 overall pick of the 2004 WNBA draft. In the 20 years that followed, she racked up six Olympic gold medals, three league championships and numerous records before calling it a career earlier this year.",
      "The 6-foot-9 Griner was a force during her 11-year stay in the desert, throwing down dunks and swatting shots like no other player while helping the Mercury win their most recent championship, in 2014. She opted to test free agency and signed a one-year contract with the Dream, hoping to set herself up for a bigger contract when the league's new collective bargaining deal is in place next year.",
      "Those are two big holes to fill, but general manager Nick U\u2019Ren already had the wheels in motion to start the Mercury's new era.",
      "Phoenix first acquired Thomas in a trade with Connecticut, adding a veteran do-everything forward who's the WNBA\u2019s career leader with 15 triple-doubles. The 6-2 forward played her entire 11-year career with the Sun, leading them to the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022, and earned a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.",
      "With Taurasi's retirement looming, Phoenix pulled off a three-way trade that brought Sabally to the desert. The 6-4 forward was an All-WNBA first-teamer in 2023, then averaged 17.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists in a 2024 season limited to 15 games because of a shoulder injury.",
      "\u201cPushing through uncomfortable times really makes us stronger and we are the pros at pushing through adversity,\u201d Sabally said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been through a lot in my life, but it just really makes you appreciate times like this even more.\u201d",
      "Rounding out Phoenix's new Big Three is Kahleah Copper, a dynamic scorer and leader.",
      "The 6-1 small forward was a three-time All-Star with Chicago before being traded to Phoenix, where she had a massive impact in just one season.",
      "Copper was the WNBA's third-leading scorer at 21.1 points per game last season and became a leader on a team that already had two of the game's best players. She also has a WNBA title under her belt, helping the Sky beat the Mercury in the 2021 finals.",
      "Now that Taurasi and Griner are gone, Copper fully will take the reigns as the team's leader, pushing teammates new and old to continue the Mercury's long history of winning.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re really going to see her kind of like spread her wings and take pride,\u201d second-year Mercury coach Nate Tibbetts said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it this whole offseason, adding the free agents, and she\u2019s really kind of bought into what we\u2019re about.\u201d",
      "The Mercury had no choice but to take a new direction with Taurasi and Griner gone. They're hoping the new core can lead the franchise along the same winning direction.",

      "North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick defended girlfriend Jordon Hudson for interjecting during a CBS interviewer's questions about their relationship and said she was \u201csimply doing her job.\"",
      "The six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach and first-time college coach at UNC issued a statement through the school Wednesday, which followed an appearance on \u201cCBS News Sunday Morning\u201d to promote his upcoming book on his coaching life. In the interview, Hudson objected to a question about how the two had met while Tony Dokoupil referred to her during the segment as being a \u201cconstant presence\u201d in the interview.",
      "\u201cThe final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation which we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career,\u201d Belichick said in his statement. \u201cInstead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "CBS spokesman Richard Huff didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "The awkward interview added to the attention and curiosity that has followed the 73-year-old Belichick, hired as the Tar Heels' head coach in December after his ultra-successful run with the New England Patriots, and the 24-year-old Hudson, who has frequently posted glimpses into their relationship with social media photos. That has included her role in Belichick's transition to college coaching, such as a March public records report by The Assembly about Belichick's request for an athletic official at UNC to copy in Hudson on emails sent to him.",
      "In his Wednesday statement, Belichick said he shares \u201cboth a personal and professional relationship\u201d with Hudson and that he expected the interview would focus solely on the book release instead of his personal life. He said Hudson had \u201cstepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion\" in an effort to \u201censure the interview stayed on track.\u201d",
      "He also said the couple has \u201cbeen open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021.\u201d",
      "During the CBS interview, Belichick shrugged off attention on his relationship with Hudson, saying: \u201cNever been too worried about what everybody else thinks, just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\u201d",
      "When Dokoupil asked how they met, Hudson \u2014 sitting at a nearby table \u2014 said flatly: \u201cWe're not talking about this.\u201d",
      "In a statement Tuesday, InkWell Management \u2014 a literary agency working with Belichick on his upcoming book \u2014 said the interview \u201cveered\u201d into a discussion of Belichick's personal life and resulted \"in a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\u201d",
      "\u201cBill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" the agency said.",

It\u2019s kind of fascinating. we won\u2019t really know what the gameboard looks like until we get the new CBA,\u201d ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. \u201cAny team could theoretically become a super team. It could be Golden State, it could Toronto or Portland in their first year. It could completely change the power dynamic as we see it.\u201d",
      "A\u2019ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart are among the star-studded group on one-year contracts knowing that a new collective bargaining agreement will hopefully be in place next season that is expected to monumentally increase salaries. The WNBA begins an 11-year $2.2 billion media rights deal in 2026 which is where the shift will come from.",
      "Most of the players who won't be free agents are the ones on rookie contracts \u2014 including Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The pair, who were rookies last season, earn about $75,000 in base pay. Currently WNBA players can have a maximum base salary of $250,000.",
      "While there hasn't been a media rights deal like this in the WNBA's 28-year history, when the NBA had an exponential increase in its TV deal in 2016, that league's salary cap increased about 35%.",
      "It\u2019s not just increased salaries, however, that will entice free agents to move. Many of the players who changed teams this offseason cited practice facilities as a factor in choosing where they\u2019ll go.",
      "Currently Phoenix, Las Vegas, Golden State and Seattle have dedicated practice facilities for their WNBA teams while Minnesota and Washington share their facilities with NBA franchises. New York, Dallas, Chicago and Indiana have ones in the works.",
      "\u201cI think facilities are a huge piece of it,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cYou heard how much players talked about that with Vegas a few years ago. Players were posting about Phoenix\u2019s new facility at All-Star last year.\u201d",
      "It's also about the culture around a franchise that makes it inviting to players.",
      "Atlanta made a splash in free agency this winter, signing Brittney Griner and Brionna Jones. Padover hopes to keep them beyond this season. Both will be free agents again next year.",
      "Free agency has never lined up like this before for the league. While New York, Las Vegas, Minnesota and Indiana are considered the top teams heading into this season, that could all be different next year.",

The Hawks made him a full-time starter, something Daniels hadn\u2019t been with the Pelicans.",

    "story": [
      "The families of Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau are still grieving their deaths last August after they were hit by a suspected drunken driver in New Jersey on the eve of their sister's wedding",
      "WESTVILLE, N.J. -- The family called him John. It wasn\u2019t until John Gaudreau played for Boston College that he picked up the \u201cJohnny Hockey\u201d nickname that followed him through 11 seasons in the NHL.",
      "His mother, Jane, gleefully recalled the \u201cJohnny Hockey\u201d T-shirts and sing-song chants BC fans bestowed on their beloved wizard on the ice. At home in New Jersey, older brother Matthew, who also played hockey for Boston College, and sisters Kristen and Katie couldn\u2019t help but tease their brother with the nickname as his popularity and All-Star career grew through stops in Calgary and Columbus.",
      "Take one night during the NHL Awards in Las Vegas, just one family story out of thousands of favorites, when Gaudreau tried to keep a low public profile on a family outing. Katie wasn\u2019t having it out on the Strip, shouting for all to hear, \u201cJohnny! Johnny Hockey!\u201d",
      "\u201cI can see John\u2019s face getting redder and redder and redder,\u201d Jane Gaudreau said with a laugh. \u201cYou walk down the street and no one knows who you are until Katie started making this whole big thing.\u201d",
      "Everything was fine for the family when they gathered last August for Katie\u2019s wedding. John and Matt were the groomsmen and Kristen the maid of honor. What happened next, the typhoon of shock and grief that rippled from New Jersey through the heart of the hockey community, has been well-documented over the last eight months. The night before the wedding, John, 31, and Matt, 29, died after they were hit by a suspected drunken driver while riding bicycles in the Delaware River country south of Philadelphia, leaving a family forever shattered, with not enough time to ever fully pick up all the pieces.",
      "They try.",
      "From births to hockey tributes, through Instagram pages dotted with photos from the family scrapbook and a new foundation, to a playground fundraising effort at the family\u2019s beloved school, the Gaudreaus have pushed through dark days when even getting out of bed seemed impossible. They pull through, pull together, just as they did as a family of six in South Jersey, and try to focus on a simple mantra: Live their lives to the fullest in honor of Matt and John.",
      "There is more hardship ahead and dark days are going to come and go. The driver charged with killing the brothers, a man prosecutors described as having a history of alleged road rage and aggressive driving, still faces trial.",
      "But as Jane Gaudreau details her dream of a new, adaptive playground for the special education students at the school where she works, it\u2019s the good times that stir the most memories. Like when John playfully threatened to stab Katie with a fork at a restaurant for not finishing a stack of pancakes and surprisingly \u2014 and gently \u2014 followed through.",
      "It's the stories that lift the spirits of Jane, husband Guy and countless friends and teammates who went through their first hockey season in decades without two men who gave so much to their growing families and to the game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to keep their memories alive,\u201d said their sister, Kristen Venello, who rocks her Blue Jackets hoodie as a speech assistant at Archbishop Damiano School. \u201cIt is sad. But you think about all the good things they did and that\u2019s all you can think about. And how much they can help us still.\u201d",
      "Archbishop Damiano School was founded in 1968 for children with Down syndrome and now provides services for 125 students with special needs from ages 3 to 21. Jane Gaudreau\u2019s brother attended the school and their mother worked there for 44 years. Jane was hired in 1984 and is still a finance associate there. Kristen, the oldest daughter, has taught at the school for almost two decades. Katie used to assist with the kids when she could and the two Gaudreau boys volunteered at the school when they weren\u2019t playing hockey.",
      "In death, they can perhaps leave a permanent legacy at Damiano outside family and hockey.",
      "Kelsie Snow lost her husband, Chris, a former assistant general manager with the Calgary Flames, in 2023 to Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. She called Jane with a suggestion on how to navigate life through perpetual grief: Keep busy. Find a project. Jane and Guy embraced the idea and searched for the right one, until they realized the answer was right there at Archbishop Damiano.",
      "The Gaudreaus and the staff at Archbishop Damiano threw themselves into fundraising for a modern playground that allows for everything from basic wheelchair accessibility to ramps and transfer platforms for the students. Students tacked their wish list for the playground -- wheelchair swings and even a sand box -- to the walls inside the school.",
      "The Gaudreau Family 5K set for May 31 is expected to bring needed cash to the initiative launched by principal Michele McCloskey in October 2020. Raising the necessary funds over the last five years had been a slow build. So many friends from the hockey world and others now inspired by the brothers and the cause have since rallied around the effort.",
      "\u201cI know the boys would be proud of us,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBoth boys loved children, that\u2019s why we thought the playground would be perfect.\u201d",
      "The Gaudreaus have another, more enduring project ahead of them as doting grandparents. Both widows have given birth since their husbands died. Meredith, who revealed during her tearful eulogy for John in August that she was pregnant, gave birth in April to the couple\u2019s third child, Carter Michael Gaudreau. Madeline delivered her and Matty\u2019s first baby, Tripp Matthew Gaudreau, in December.",
      "Jane laughs when she describes how much the new additions resemble their fathers. Tripp has light hair like his dad; Carter looks like big sister Noa, and they both look like John.",
      "\u201cMy husband keeps saying this,\u201d Jane said, \u201d\u2018I think God sent us John and Matty back.\u2018\u201d",
      "Guy Gaudreu, a former hockey coach at Hollydell Ice Arena and Gloucester Catholic High School in New Jersey, had his sons on the ice at 2 years old and he\u2019s already making plans for Carter and Tripp. Matthew played for the junior ice hockey Omaha Lancers for two years, and when the family was invited back last month for a tribute night, Guy amused the family as he gave baby Tripp an introduction.",
      "\u201cHe was like, smell the ice, this is the locker room,\u201d Jane said with a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re used to that. He\u2019s just crazy like that. I was looking at (Madeline) and she was just laughing, shaking her head.\u201d",
      "The Gaudreaus have kept busy, with fundraising, teaching and various outings that celebrated their sons. Guy has perhaps been at the rink the most since losing the boys. He joined practices for the Blue Jackets and spent time as a guest instructor this season with the Flyers. He hit the ice in Montreal and helped out Team USA at the 4 Nations Face-Off. The Gaudreaus led the Blue Jackets out of the tunnel at Ohio Stadium in front of nearly 95,000 fans at the NHL Stadium Series.",
      "\u201cI know sometimes we\u2019ll hear people, oh, this poor family, they have to go through this again,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been quite healing. Through this, I\u2019ve had so many people tell stories of what Matthew or John has done for them, or a hospital, or other people. They appreciate everything the boys did. They were grieving, too. It was a way for us to get out there and talk to people, hear different stories.\u201d",
      "Jane needed a gentle nudge from some Blue Jackets to attend the team\u2019s annual Moms\u2019 Trip to a February game at Detroit. Defenseman Erik Gudbranson surprised Jane with a persuasive call for her attend the annual bonding trip. The other Blue Jackets moms were so supportive of her on the trip, she said, \u201cthey knew if I was going to get upset before I even knew.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe needed her there,\u201d Gudbranson said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have felt right if she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Sean Monahan and Gaudreau became tight when the stars played together in Calgary, one reason the Blue Jackets center was persuaded by his friend to sign with the team last summer.",
      "Monahan and his family settled near the Gaudreaus in the same Columbus suburb of New Albany, so close as neighbors Monahan counted just 25 steps between the two houses. After Gaudreau\u2019s death, Monahan couldn\u2019t even drive by his friend\u2019s house on his commute to the rink. He and his family have tried to serve as a steady source of support for Meredith and her three children. Monahan even met Carter Gaudreau the day he was born (\u201cgood looking little guy, just like John\u201d).",
      "The Blue Jackets dedicated the season to the Gaudreaus and raised John\u2019s No. 13 to the rafters. There\u2019s a patch on the jerseys and the Blue Jackets wore Avalon Surf Shop sweatshirts as part of their \u201cJohnny fit\u201d collection. The team never failed to hang Gaudreau\u2019s jersey in a locker stall for every game, home or away.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be here with us,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one other thing we can do to keep his name around, keep his legacy going for such a special person.\u201d",
      "Motivated by the memory of their friend, the Blue Jackets were in the hunt for a playoff spot until the final week of the season. They fell two points shy, leaving the team with a \u201cwhat if?\u201d feeling over missing the playoffs while hurting over Gaudreau.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that weighs on my mind and it\u2019s something I think about every day,\" Monahan said. \"There are no easy days, for sure. I try and live the way he did and it benefited me.\u201d",
      "Gudbranson also held Carter in the hospital and wrestled with the conflicting feelings of the joy over the birth with the sadness Gaudreau was not alive to meet his son.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a part of you that says this feels wrong that I\u2019m holding my buddy\u2019s son and he hasn\u2019t met him,\u201d Gudbranson said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to wrap your head around. Those kids will probably be 30 years old and I\u2019ll be thinking the same thing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Gudbranson said that in large part because of Gaudreau\u2019s influence, the season was a \u201ca lot more joyous this year. We\u2019ve enjoyed being teammates.\u201d When the good times were rolling, the Blue Jackets tried to appreciate those moments just like Gaudreau did, the franchise player who was just one of the boys once the final horn sounded.",
      "\u201cOnce the game was done, we were just buddies,\u201d Gudbranson said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t necessarily Johnny Hockey to us. The personal side matters to us the most. But yeah, we\u2019ve had conversations like, can you imagine if this guy was on our team this year? How good would he have been with us this year? Holy smokes.\u201d",
      "Guy and Jane, married 42 years, almost never go out to dinner, overwhelmed by feelings of guilt over enjoying themselves, and those emotions also run deep with Katie. She told her mom, yes, she wanted to marry her fianc\u00e9, Devin Joyce, but wasn\u2019t sure a big wedding was the way to go. Jane said she simply told her there was no wrong decision, but to let the rage and sadness settle and take as much time as necessary make a decision.",
      "The couple eventually rescheduled their wedding for July 11. Katie wrote on her Instagram post, \u201cI guess this year has taught me to celebrate our love everyday, every minute.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know the boys, they\u2019ll be there with us that day,\u201d Jane said. \u201cThey would want you to have fun.\u201d",
      "Jane added with resolve, \u201cThis guy already took two of the most important things away from us. Don\u2019t let him take away your wedding.\u201d",
      "Katie reflected on that fateful night on an Instagram post how she had texted her fianc\u00e9 \u201cwe forgot to practice our dip,\u201d during rehearsal to how a \u201cphone call later, our lives would forever change.\u201d",
      "The couple will get a second chance at a wedding, this one in memory of their brothers.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ll all be able to get through the day,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI think it will be hard at first. We want to be there for her, support her. The other three had big weddings, it was so fun for our family to be together. I think it will be OK.\u201d",
      "The Gaudreaus want people to remember how the young men lived, not how they died. Sometimes that is difficult: In mid-April, there was a hearing for Sean Higgins, the man charged with reckless vehicular homicide in the Gaudreaus' deaths, only a few hours before the Blue Jackets played the Flyers nearby. The family skipped the game for the Gloucester Catholic High School Hall of Fame banquet where Matthew was posthumously inducted.",
      "The Gaudreaus have kept their thoughts about the court proceedings private, though Jane did write a pair of inspirational quotes on Instagram later that day, including one that said, \u201cWhen you have a bad day \u2014 a really bad day \u2014 try and treat the world better than it treated you.\u201d",
      "The 5K has filled its allotment of 1,000 runners for race day at a New Jersey park but anyone can contribute from home as a virtual participant. More than 700 people have already signed up, from New Jersey to Canada to Ireland, eager to help the cause, which includes an online memorabilia auction that stretches beyond hockey, with all proceeds donated toward the playground effort and its $600,000 goal.",
      "Jane, 62, said it\u2019s hard to remember much through the haze of heartbreak from the funeral and memorial reception, only that she figured more than 1,000 people stopped by the family home to pay their respects. With some distance, the family hoped it would be comforting to see everyone at the 5K and thank them for their love and comfort.",
      "The current playground doesn\u2019t meet the needs of its students in its current shape, there are gaping holes in the turf and the swings and slides were not designed for children with disabilities. If the goal is met, the school hopes to break ground this fall and complete the project next spring.",
      "\u201cAs a school for serving people with multiple disabilities, we really don\u2019t get a lot of traction,\u201d said McCloskey, the school principal. \u201cI think through all the media attention, I think people see it, they see why this is important.\u201d",
      "It seems trite to call it a silver lining but the family has searched in vain to find some meaning, some good out of the senseless deaths.",
      "So they\u2019ll run.",
      "For John. For Matt. For a cause the boys so robustly supported in life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the way I\u2019d want to build the playground, of course,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI tend to believe they\u2019ll be up there, being able to listen to the children\u2019s laughter. They\u2019ll just really love the fact that the children will have a playground to play in.\u201d",

      "It could be great for Antetokounmpo; he'd pick a new spot and that team would instantly be considered a title contender. It could be great for the Bucks; most teams after years of contending have to hit the reset button at some point anyway, and they could get a haul of players and picks to begin anew.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to do this. I\u2019m not going to do this,\" Antetokounmpo said in response to the question. \"I know ... whatever I say, I know how it\u2019s going to translate. I don\u2019t know, man. I wish I was still playing. I wish I was still competing and going back to Milwaukee. I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Here's what might figure into the answer, whenever the time comes to formulate the real one: His place in Milwaukee lore is secure, he's brought an NBA championship to the city, he won't have Damian Lillard for much if not all of next season because of Lillard's torn Achilles, his team just got eliminated in the first round for the third consecutive season and the Bucks aren't exactly loaded with draft picks or easy ways to bolster their roster.",
      "Antetokounmpo is in his prime. He's about to finish in the top four of the voting for the NBA MVP award \u2014 a trophy he's won twice \u2014 for the seventh consecutive year. He just averaged 30 points per game for the third year in a row, and if he had scored eight more measly points in the 2021-22 season it'd be four straight years of doing that. He just averaged at least 25 points and 10 rebounds for the eighth straight season; only Shaquille O'Neal, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone have more such seasons.",
      "Antetokounmpo will want more, whether he's in Milwaukee or elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times that life has made me sad or frustrated since I was a kid. I never gave up,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"You know, I always try to find solutions in my life. I think it translates to the basketball court. I always try to, even though things might not happen the way I want it to happen. I always have class, and I have this optimistic mentality of coming back, keep on working. And there\u2019s going to be a day that\u2019s it going to be your turn.\u201d",
      "Moving someone with two years and $113 million left on his contract \u2014 not to mention a player option that could extend it by another year and tack $63 million more onto the bill \u2014 will be difficult. And players don\u2019t always get traded where they want to go; the obvious case in point there is when Lillard wanted to be traded by Portland to Miami and wound up in Milwaukee instead.",
      "But if it's what he wants, teams will jump at the chance to make it happen.",
      "\u201cGiannis is one of one,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cI think, unfortunately for all the voters, they're tired of voting for him for stuff. But he had every bit of an MVP season this year. What I'm most proud of is he has turned into a leader. I'm not just talking about on the floor, but off the floor.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo has received tons of praise in recent years for the way he has sometimes given long, well-thought-out, from-the-heart answers to important questions in postgame news conferences. He handled a question about the postgame fracas that involved Indiana star Tyrese Haliburton's father essentially taunting Antetokounmpo on the court seconds after the final buzzer with his traditional grace and charm. It wasn't the first time Antetokounmpo found the right words in an important moment.",
      "Another important moment is here. Another big question. Stay or go?",

      "She can groove to rock and electronica. But the 15-year-old California sea lion's talent shines most in bobbing to disco hits like \u201cBoogie Wonderland.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",
      "Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some primates. But then there\u2019s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the meaning of music.",
      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",
      "Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
      "What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.",
      "\u201cScientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners \u2014 like humans and parrots \u2014 could learn to find a beat,\u201d said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico\u2019s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.",
      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",
      "To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",
      "Ronan was the top diva.",
      "\u201cNo human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\u201d said Cook, adding that \"she's much better than when she was a kid,\u201d indicating lifetime learning.",
      "The new study confirms Ronan's place as one of the \u201ctop ambassadors\u201d of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers plan to train and test other sea lions. Cook suspects other sea lions can also bob to a beat \u2014 but that Ronan will still stand out as a star performer.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not how our AI should operate,\" Kaplan said on X. \"We\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\u201d",
      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

      "The U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement that will give the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast critical mineral resources",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Ukraine on Wednesday signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral resources, finalizing a deal months in the making that could enable continued military aid to Kyiv amid concerns that President Donald Trump might scale back support in ongoing peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The two sides offered only barebone details about the structure of the deal, which they called the United States-Ukraine Reinvestment Fund. But it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a critical moment in the three-year war as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides. The signing comes two months after a different but similar agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump has long criticized Zelenskyy, saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to win the war and blaming him for prolonging the killing by not giving up Crimea, but in recent days has rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin as well, saying he was complicating negotiations with \u201cvery bad timing\u201d in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.",
      "Trump said Wednesday night on NewsNation that the deal, \u201cin theory,\u201d means that the U.S. will get more from Ukraine than it contributed. \u201cI wanted to be protected,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to be looking \u201cfoolish\u201d by not getting money back for the investment.",
      "For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.",
      "\u201cTruly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,\u201d said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \u201cThis is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal.",
      "\u201cTogether with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment to our country,\u201d she said in a post on X after the signing.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bessent said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House \u2014 hours after Ukrainian officials indicated a deal was nearly finalized \u2014 that there was still work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said when asked about reports that Ukraine was ready to agree to the pact. \"We\u2019re sure that they will reconsider that. And we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are.\u201d",
      "He didn't elaborate as to the late changes he said Ukraine made.",
      "The U.S. has been seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday, empowering Svyrydenko to sign it in Washington. The deal still needs to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it can take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.",
      "Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money \u2014 a complaint he repeated Wednesday during his Cabinet meeting. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.",
      "\u201cWe are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,\" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.",
      "Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.",
      "The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.",

      "Three Chinese astronauts have landed back on Earth after six months on China\u2019s space station",
      "BEIJING -- Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Wednesday after six months on China's space station.",
      "The crew\u2019s landing module came down slowly after separating from the return vehicle, descending on a red-and-white parachute, in Dongfeng, in China\u2019s northern Inner Mongolia region on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Their return had been delayed by a day due to strong winds and low visibility. The area is prone to sandstorms this time of year.",
      "The astronauts, Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, were launched to the Tiangong space station in October, and they turned over control of the station Tuesday to the new crew that recently arrived to replace them.",

      "The Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station has made China a major player in a new era of space exploration and the use of permanent stations to conduct experiments in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns.",
      "China\u2019s space program is controlled by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.",
      "The three Chinese astronauts have carried out experiments and improvements to the space station during their time in space. Two of the astronauts, Cai and Song, conducted a nine-hour spacewalk, the world\u2019s longest, during their mission, China's space agency said.",
      "The country\u2019s space program has grown rapidly in recent years. The space agency has landed an explorer on Mars and a rover on the far side of the moon. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has issued a new policy for terminating international students' legal status",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status.",
      "The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status canceled in recent weeks with little explanation.",
      "In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.",
      "On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be canceled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the U.S.",
      "Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status. In the past, if a student had their visa revoked, they could stay in the U.S. to finish their studies \u2014 they simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "\u201cThis just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Banias said.",
      "Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.",
      "Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated \u2014 and then reinstated \u2014 this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.",
      "In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped \u2014 information that is also in NCIC.",
      "Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: \u201cPlease terminate all in SEVIS.\u201d That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.",
      "Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.",
      "\u201cAll of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,\u201d said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated \u201can utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.\u201d",
      "When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.",
      "Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled \u201cfailure to maintain status.\u201d Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an \u201cinvestigative red flag.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Patel is lawfully present in the U.S.,\u201d Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. \u201cHe is not subject to immediate detention or removal.\u201d",
      "Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.",

      "Artificial intelligence technology that works well for the world\u2019s billions of people of color was a business imperative for Google when the company asked sociologist Ellis Monk to help make its AI products more inclusive",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- After retreating from their workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs, tech companies could now face a second reckoning over their DEI work in AI products.",
      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",
      "Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden's AI policies were \u201cpromoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "People with diseases caused by rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than other patients despite rapid recent advancements in the growing field of genetic science",
      "Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can\u2019t get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.",
      "She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won\u2019t help her.",
      "The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases \u2014 and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.",
      "\u201cWe feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,\u201d said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. \u201cBut we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It\u2019s really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.\u201d",
      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

Meanwhile, the judge sided with state attorneys seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and their argument that federal approval of cultivated chicken doesn't mean individual states can't ban it.",
      "U.S. regulators first signed off on the sale of what\u2019s known as \u201ccell-cultured\u201d or \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d meat in June 2023. The lawsuit had argued that Florida\u2019s law is preempted under federal laws that regulate the interstate market for meat and poultry products. Sellers say the product is a more ethical and sustainable alternative to conventionally raised chicken, beef and pork.",
      "But lawmakers in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have called cultivated meat a threat to their states\u2019 agriculture industries and banned the sale of the product, which is made of animal cells that are fed a mix of proteins, vitamins and water and then formed into nuggets, sausages and steaks.",

      "\u201cUpside is not looking to replace conventional meat, which will always have a place at the table,\u201d Upside CEO Uma Valeti said in a statement. \"All we are asking for is the right to compete, so that Floridians can try our product and see that it is possible to have delicious meat without the need for slaughtering animals. Today\u2019s ruling is an important step toward securing that right.\u201d",
      "The governor's office and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",

      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",

      "The grants were allocated under President Joe Biden's signature Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.

      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press release. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.

The U.S. refuted that series of events in comments during President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting Wednesday, saying it was \"ready to sign\" the agreement but the Ukrainians decided on Tuesday night to \"make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said.",

      "The former presidential candidate spoke as she considers re-entering politics.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stayed largely out of the political limelight since leaving office, sharply criticized President Donald Trump \u2013 her opponent in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 over tariffs, government cuts, and the direction his administration is taking the country, during remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco.",
      "Her remarks, delivered at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office, came as the Trump administration celebrates its accomplishments in its first 100 days \u2013 a date Harris acknowledged.",
      "\"Now I know tonight's event happens to coincide with 100 days after the inauguration, and I'll leave it to others to give a full accounting of what's happened so far,\" Harris told the audience.",
      "\"But I will say this, instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\" she said.",
      "Harris has had few public appearances since departing the White House and has limited her political activity, but on Wednesday night, she called out Trump by name.",
      "\"We all know President Trump, his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,\" Harris said.",
      "\"But what they're overlooking, what they've overlooked, is that fear isn't the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious,\" Harris said to raucous cheers.",
      "Harris had brought up similar themes \u2013 including the \"courage is contagious\" line \u2013 during remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April.",
      "That courage, Harris added on Wednesday, extends to Americans protesting against what she called \"the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.\"",
      "\"Americans across the political spectrum who are declaring that the president's reckless tariffs hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials; devastate the retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into; and paralyze American businesses, large and small forcing them to lay off people, stop hiring, or pause investment decisions,\" she said.",
      "Trump and the White House have argued that tariffs will help Americans be better off economically in the long run and will level the playing field between the U.S. and its trading partners.",
      "Later in her remarks, speaking more broadly about the White House's actions, Harris said she would describe the current moment in America as a \"high-velocity event\" to implement an agenda she claimed was \"decades in the making\" to shrink and privatize government while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\"It's an agenda, a narrow self-serving vision of America, where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power and leave everyone to fend for themselves, all while abandoning allies and retreating from the world,\" Harris said. \"And folks, what we are experiencing right now is exactly what they envision for America.\"",
      "Americans should be ready, if the \"checks and balances\" such as Congress \"ultimately collapse,\" Harris said, to work together and raise their voices.",
      "\"I am not here tonight to offer all the answers, but I am here to say this, you are not alone, and we are all in this together -- and straight talk, things are probably going to get worse before they get better, but we are ready for it. We are not going to scatter. We are going to stand together, everyone a leader,\" Harris said.",
      "At the end of her remarks, Harris struck a populist note: \"Always remember this country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to We The People.\"",
      "The former Democratic nominee for president has had few public appearances since departing the White House, and has limited her political activity.",
      "Harris' speech came as she is set to possibly re-enter politics in the coming months. Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.",
      "Some Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.",
      "Whether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "In remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "And in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"",
      "Harris and her spouse, Doug Emhoff, have been the target of recent actions by Trump.",
      "Trump issued a memo in March that revoked the security clearances and access to classified information of his previous presidential opponents -- Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris -- as well as more than a dozen former administration officials. On Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been dismissed from the board of trustees of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as the White House confirmed it had removed board members.",

Trump's trade policy has lurched from empty threats to sweeping tariffs to humiliating retreats, roiling markets and destroying remaining confidence in U.S. economic leadership,\" said Edward Alden, a columnist at Foreign Policy and visiting professor at Western Washington University.",
      "\"Unless the administration can bring some discipline to its approach, Trump will accomplish none of his goals and leave the United States poorer and weaker,\" he continued.",
      "But tariffs have also evolved into a tool deployed by the White House to coerce foreign governments to comply with its broader agenda.",
      "Just days after his return to the White House, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Colombia if its President Gustavo Petro didn't agree to take in deportees from the U.S. Petro initially said he would impose retaliatory tariffs but soon reversed course -- accepting two planeloads of migrants.",
      "Additionally, Trump's hawkish approach to tariffs has fueled tension between the world's two largest economies: China and the U.S.",
      "The trade relationship between the U.S. and Beijing was a frequent target of Trump's ire during his first term. Now, he has taken the feud to the next level-- raising levies on Chinese imports as high as 145%.",
      "This time around also feels like a more personal battle between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. White House officials have hinted that trade negotiations between the nations have been quietly taking place -- a claim China's foreign ministry adamantly denies. Beijing also disputes a claim the president made in a recent interview with Time that Xi had called him.",
      "\"With both sides convinced they hold the advantage -- and neither signaling a shift in posture -- the U.S.-China relationship is entering a new era of heightened confrontation,\" said Craig Singleton, the senior director of the China Program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "Despite the apparent lack of progress toward a trade deal with China, the White House says more than 100 countries around the world have come to the table in the wake of the president's tariff war -- a dynamic that will test the administration's ability to simultaneously carry out so many complicated economic negotiations in the weeks and months to come.",
      "Expansionist intent",
      "In his second term, the president's international ambitions have extended well beyond tariffs. Even before taking office, Trump indicated he was laser focused on assuming control of two foreign territories: the Panama Canal and Greenland.",
      "Administration officials often argue that in both cases, the president is primarily concerned about foreign interference and its impact on national security. But other statements and actions signal there may be more at play.",
      "On Saturday, Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform that American ships should be able to transit the Panama Canal as well as Egypt's Suez Canal free of charge, adding that he had directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"immediately take care of\" the situation.",
      "And when Vice President J.D. Vance visited Greenland in March, he indicated that the Trump administration's interest in the territory was fueled in part by interest in edging out China and Russia in the competition for the rare earth resources that may lie buried under its ice sheet.",
      "\"We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in Arctic passageways and Arctic naval routes and indeed in the minerals of the Arctic territories. We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic, because we know that if America doesn't other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind,\" Vance said.",
      "The Trump administration's drive to secure critical minerals is also intertwined in its dealings with Ukraine and appears to have motivated efforts to secure peace in other areas of the world. As part of its work to pave the way for U.S. investments in the mineral-rich Democratic Republic of the Congo, the administration has played a key role in brokering peace negotiations between the country and Rwanda.",
      "Deals deferred",
      "Meanwhile, other longstanding conflicts the president initially declared he would swiftly resolve continue to rage as U.S. mediation efforts sputter.",
      "Trump famously said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine on \"day one\" of his second term -- a claim he now says was \"an exaggeration.\"",
      "The first 100 days of the second Trump term have seen the U.S. approach to Russia and Ukraine undergo a dramatic shift.",
      "With Moscow, the Trump administration has brought about a significant warming of relations. Delegations from both the U.S. and Russia have been involved in slow but steady talks to revive their diplomatic presences in each other's countries, while top Trump administration negotiator Steve Witkoff has now met face-to-face with Russian leader Vladimir Putin four times.",
      "Dealings with Ukraine, on the other hand, have presented some of the administration's most intense and iconic foreign policy moments.",
      "In late February, Trump, Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sparred inside the Oval Office. After the spat, Zelenskyy was instructed to leave the White House",
      "Over this past weekend, in an entirely different scene from the Oval Office encounter, Trump and Zelensky met again -- this time, just two of them sitting alone, inside a hushed St. Peter's Basilica as world leaders gathered at the Vatican to pay their last respects to Pope Francis.",
      "Amid the stark highs and lows of his interactions with Zelenskyy, Trump has repeatedly insisted he is neutral and simply wants to put an end to the bloodshed.",
      "But Trump and his administration have also set a tight deadline for U.S. involvement in the process, with the president declaring after his meeting with Zelenskyy that he expected to see progress within \"two weeks or less.\"",
      "Critics of the Trump administration's approach have consistently faulted the president for failing to hold the Kremlin accountable.",
      "\"Trump's desire for peace is laudable. But the way he has pursued it -- undercutting Ukraine while putting no tangible pressure on Russia -- leaves much to be desired,\" said John Hardie, the deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "\"The shift in Washington's Ukraine policy under Trump has contributed to a broader erosion of European trust in America,\" he continued. \"The silver lining: Europe now appears more serious than ever about stepping up on defense.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the 101st day of the president\u2019s term, the Trump administration did secure one deal with Ukraine -- signing onto a long-awaited partnership with the country that gives American businesses access to Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources.",
      "Administration officials say the partnership will provide Kyiv with implicit security guarantees by increasing U.S. involvement in Ukraine\u2019s economy, but the agreement has no direct impact on efforts to finally bring the war with Russia to a close.",
      "Israel, Gaza",
      "With Israel's war in Gaza, the Trump administration has taken a more hands-off approach, even though the conflict appeared to be on the brink of a resolution when he re-entered the White House in January.",
      "In tandem with the outgoing Biden administration, Trump officials worked to secure a three-phase ceasefire/hostage-release that saw the release of 33 captives that had been detained since the Oct. 7 attacks, including two Americans. But the framework fell apart before the parties could move into its second phase, which would see the release of the final American hostage held in Gaza.",
      "Despite promises to find an endgame for the conflict, much of Trump's focus seems to have been on his unusual proposal to relocate Gazans and redevelop the territory, a pitch that was met by widespread backlash.",
      "But Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and former National Security Council official, says Trump will eventually have to take on the conflict -- or see his agenda constrained by it.",
      "\"The Israeli-Palestinian front remains the thorniest and most difficult challenge to producing progress in the Middle East. Without a clear game plan to end the war, bring hostages home, and improve the living conditions for the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, the Trump administration's wider aspirations for the Middle East will continue to face limits,\" he said.",
      "In the first months of his term, Trump has also rekindled long-stagnant nuclear talks with Iran -- while also declaring he would be \"leading the pack\" in a military strike on the country if it did not ultimately agree to a deal.",
      "Diplomacy deconstructed",
      "The initial weeks of Trump's second term have seen no shortage of turmoil in Washington, and the president's aims of shrinking the federal government and ramping up efficiency have resulted in significant cuts to diplomatic structures.",
      "As one of his first executive actions, Trump ordered a freeze on all foreign aid spending. His administration quickly began lobbing accusations of fraud and other misdeeds against the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and moved to close it. By February it had suspended most of its employees, and by March, officials developed plans to fold the few programs that had not been cancelled into the framework of the State Department.",
      "But the State Department is also bracing for major staffing reductions. In April, Rubio unveiled plans to drastically overhaul the department by sharply cutting the number of offices within it and ultimately wiping out roughly 700 Washington, D.C.-based positions for Foreign Service and Civil Service employees.",
      "Additionally, Rubio has instructed leaders throughout the department to draw up plans to reduce their personnel by 15% -- a move that could lead to thousands of additional job cuts.",
      "Already, the second Trump administration has seen the State Department shift its focus from international organizations and peacekeeping efforts to carrying out the president's deportation goals and securing the southern border. Rubio's first actions in his post include designating international cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and securting various deals with South American and Central American nations -- including, most controversially, El Salvador -- to accept deportees from the U.S.",
      "Beyond Washington, Trump has also withdrawn from a number of international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations Human Rights Council.",
      "At the 100-day mark, there is one vacant seat in Trump's Cabinet: the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.",
      "\"Trump believes his actions will consolidate U.S. power and put an end to America being 'ripped off' by an outdated international system,\" said Bronwen Maddox, the director and chief executive of Chatham House.",
      "\"The danger is that by unpicking the alliances and institutions that have underpinned US power at such breakneck speed, Trump ends up handing the US's many advantages \u2013 in innovation, commercial strength and global influence -- to Beijing,\" she added.",

      "It was the first time Trump and Zelenskyy had met face-to-face since their heated argument in the Oval Office  in February.",
      "At the time, Zelenskyy contended the Russian president needed stronger pushback from Ukraine's allies.",
      "\"I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,\" Zelenskyy said to Trump at the February meeting.",
      "Moran noted that Trump has since appeared to have changed his thinking about Putin's intentions, bringing up what Trump said in a social media post after his conversation with Zelenskyy in St. Peter's.",
      "\"There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, in cities and towns, over the last few days,\" he said in the post. \"It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war. He's just tapping me along.\"",
      "Trump repeated those comments in the interview.",
      "\"It's possible. Yeah, that's possible. Sure,\" he said. \"He could be tapping me along a little bit. I would say that he would like to stop the war.\"",
      "When Moran asked if Trump truly believed Putin wanted to end the war even with the continued attacks, Trump claimed that negotiations would have been much worse under a different president.",

      "The 9/11 health program that monitors and treats thousands of people exposed to toxic dust during the 2001 terrorist attack is under threat \u2014 again.",
      "A wave of staffing cuts and agency turmoil has thrown the World Trade Center Health Program into crisis, disrupting a system that has provided life-saving care to tens of thousands of people for more than two decades.",
      "Experts warn that cancer diagnoses could be delayed, mental health needs could go unmet and the federal government would break its promise to \"never forget.\"",
      "\"This isn't about politics \u2014 it's about humanity,\" said John Feal, a former 9/11 responder and founder of the FealGood Foundation. \"We're not going away. We're going to keep coming back until they do the right thing.\"",
      "At the center of the controversy is a series of staffing cuts within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the agency that certifies 9/11-related illnesses as valid and oversees the World Trade Center Health Program, which administers care to first responders and survivors of the 2001 terrorist attack in lower Manhattan.",
      "Earlier this year, a 20% staffing cut to the World Trade Health Center Program led to the termination of 16 doctors and nurses, reducing the clinical team to 72, Feal explained.",
      "After a bipartisan outcry, those positions were reinstated in February.",
      "But in April, a second round of cuts eliminated another 16 staffers. Whether those cuts involved any of the reinstated individuals from the first cut is unknown, but they left the program roiling and once again undermined its ability to provide timely care.",
      "In addition to the second round of cuts in April, Dr. John Howard, the longtime program leader, was also removed. He was then quickly reinstated after political pressure.",
      "More than 150,000 people are currently enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Program, up from about 76,000 in 2015.",
      "The program had been preparing to grow its staff to meet rising demand. Instead, it is now struggling to function, according to Michael Barasch, a lawyer with Barasch & McGarry, a firm that represents thousands of 9/11 first responders and survivors.",
      "Barasch told ABC News that patients are waiting six to eight months for appointments.",
      "\"This is a program with zero fraud that only does one thing: It saves lives,\" Barasch said. \"Mark my words: People will die without it.\"",
      "Toxic dust from the attacks contained a dangerous mix of chemicals and debris: asbestos, ground glass, benzene, chromium, lead. Those exposed \u2014 first responders, recovery workers, office staff, students, residents \u2014 potentially face higher rates of at least 69 cancers, as well as respiratory disease and post-traumatic stress.",
      "\"If he had it in his lungs, so does everybody else,\" Barasch said, referring to NYPD Detective James Zadroga, whose death at age 34 in 2006 was linked to inhaling the hazardous air. \"So we're all ticking time bombs.\"",
      "The World Trade Center Health Program was established through the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which was permanently reauthorized in 2015.",
      "But funding projections failed to account for medical inflation or growing enrollment. A bipartisan bill known as HR 1410 would fix the shortfall, but it remains stalled in Congress.",
      "Feal said he thought the system isn't just overwhelmed \u2014 it's collapsing.",
      "\"We've built a program that saves lives and gives people dignity,\" he said. \"Letting it fall apart now dishonors everyone who ran toward danger that day.\"",
      "Barasch noted that many lawmakers \u2014 especially those outside of New York \u2014 may not realize the scope of the damage or how many of their own constituents are affected.",
      "\"People in all 50 states are enrolled in the program,\" he said. \"Thousands of them no longer live near the original attack sites. They need care where they are.\" He urged everyone to call their senators and representatives and remind them of the promise made to the 9/11 community.",
      "In meetings on Capitol Hill with lawmakers this week, Feal said he and other advocates seem to have found a sympathetic audience. Even so, he remains skeptical: \"They listen \u2014 but will they act? That's the question.\"",
      "An HHS spokesperson told ABC News in an email: \"The World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program\u2019s Clinical Centers of Excellence and Nationwide Provider Network are continuing to provide services to program members at this time.

      "\u201cYou remember the big thing with eggs? They hit me the first week, \u2018Eggs, eggs, eggs,\u2019 like it was my fault. I said, \u2018I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by [Joe] Biden,\u2019\u201d Trump told ABC News\u2019 Terry Moran.",
      "\u201cEgg prices are down,\u201d Trump later added.",
      "The remarks echoed claims made repeatedly by Trump since he took office, but his assessment of egg prices is potentially misleading, some food economists told ABC News.",
      "Retail egg prices, or the prices paid by shoppers, have climbed over the early months of Trump\u2019s term, meaning household budgets have been slammed by worsening egg costs, the economists said.",
      "By contrast, wholesale egg prices -- the amount grocers pay to suppliers -- have dropped significantly since Trump took office, though Trump appeared to overstate the amount of decline during the ABC News interview.",
      "It remains unclear when and to what extent that decline in wholesale egg prices will translate into relief for consumers, economists added.",
      "\u201cEgg prices have been increasing at the retail level and that\u2019s really important when assessing the claim President Trump made yesterday,\u201d said David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University.",
      "Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, added: \"I encourage people who are reading the news about food prices to focus on consumer prices, not wholesale prices, because that\u2019s what real consumers care about.\"",
      "Economists also largely rejected the attribution of blame for egg prices to any president, whether former President Joe Biden or Trump, saying a president exerts minimal influence over day-to-day egg costs.",
      "\u201cThe president has little or no control over egg prices,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cAny changes, whether egg prices go up or down, have almost nothing to do with what the president or any other policymaker is doing.\u201d",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s claim that eggs prices are falling, the price paid by shoppers has increased significantly since he took office, food economists said.",
      "The average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, the most recent month for which data is available. That change in price amounted to a 25% spike, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.",
      "In recent years, bird flu -- also known as avian flu -- has decimated the egg supply while demand has persisted, lifting prices higher.",
      "\u201cEven as egg prices have exploded over the last year or two, we\u2019ve actually seen really strong demand for eggs,\u201d Trey Malone, a food economist at Purdue University, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe reality is it\u2019s really hard to substitute away from eggs. I can\u2019t make cookies without eggs if I want to make grandma\u2019s recipe.\u201d",
      "In recent months, however, the rise in retail egg prices has coincided with a drop in wholesale prices. That decline largely owes to an easing of the avian flu outbreak, food economists told ABC News.",
      "When Trump refers to a drop in egg prices, he may be referring to the decline in wholesale prices. In a memo on Tuesday listing economic accomplishments, the White House highlighted the drop in wholesale egg prices while acknowledging that retail prices may still be elevated for some consumers.",
      "\"Most consumers have seen relief in prices on the shelf, but all consumers should see it within the next month or two,\" the White House said.",
      "Speaking with ABC News on Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cEggs are down 87% since I got involved.\"",
      "Trump has provided different figures for the size of the drop in egg prices. On April 17, he said prices had fallen 92%, while on April 4 he said egg prices had dropped 87%.",
      "Each of those figures overstates the drop in wholesale egg prices, according to data from the USDA.",
      "On Jan. 21, the day after Trump took office, the average wholesale price of a dozen eggs stood at $6.55; as of April 30, that price had dropped to $3.25, a Trading Economics analysis of USDA data shows. That change in price amounts to a roughly 50% decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not accurate to say egg prices have decreased by 87%,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cWholesale egg prices are down but they\u2019re not down by that much.\u201d",
      "The decline in wholesale egg prices may result in a drop in the prices paid by consumers, but the timing and extent of the relief remain unclear, food economists said.",
      "The lag owes in part to the nature of contracts between businesses and egg suppliers, which often lock in prices for weeks, experts said. Grocers may also be reluctant to slash egg prices, some experts added, since customers have largely kept up egg purchases at higher prices.",
      "\u201cFor as much people talk about increasing egg prices, they\u2019re still buying eggs,\u201d Malone said.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority on Wednesday appeared ready to clear the way for creation of the nation's first religious charter school funded directly with taxpayer dollars.",
      "The justices heard arguments in a landmark dispute from Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court last year blocked the Catholic Church from receiving a charter school contract on grounds that it violated state and federal constitutional bans on government-sponsored sectarian education.",
      "A decision overruling the state high court would have ripple effects nationwide, especially in the 45 states that are home to 8,000 charter schools serving more than 3.8 million kids.",
      "The state's Republican attorney general argues that charter schools are public schools \u2013 open to all and subject to close supervision \u2013 and, as such, operate as extensions of state government subject to principles of separation of church and state.",
      "Lawyers for the prospective school -- St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School -- insist that it is privately created and controlled and that excluding it from generally available charter school funding is religious discrimination.",
      "For more than two hours, the justices debated application of the First Amendment's competing religion clauses to the case, weighing both its prohibition of state establishment of religion and its protection of free exercise of religious faith.",
      "The court's three liberal members were united in the view that charter schools are quintessentially public institutions that cannot advance a specific ideology using taxpayer funds.",
      "\"The essence of the Establishment Clause was, we're not going to pay religious leaders to teach their religion,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan noted that the Oklahoma law creating a charter school program explicitly says they must be nonreligious.",
      "\"These are state-run institutions,\" Kagan said. \"With respect to a whole variety of things, the state is running these schools and insisting upon certain requirements.\"",
      "Conservatives suggested they had a fundamentally different view of charter schools -- as contractors for a public service rather than an arm of the government.",
      "\"The argument that St. Isidore and the board has made is that it's a private entity that is participating in a state program,\" noted Justice Clarence Thomas. \"It was not created by the state program.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern that a ruling against St. Isidore on First Amendment grounds could call into question other government contracts with religiously affiliated organizations.",
      "\"I think a concern here is that religiously operated senior homes or food banks or foster care agencies or adoption agencies or homeless shelters, many of which get substantial funding from the government, would potentially \u2026 become state actors and, thus, not be able to exercise their religion,\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "A series of recent Supreme Court decisions has endorsed the idea that taxpayer-funded public benefit programs, from school vouchers to state-run scholarships, must be equally available, even if a person or organization has a religious affiliation.",
      "Many of the justices said those precedents apply to the Oklahoma case.",
      "Kavanaugh emphasized that religious charter schools would provide families with \"options\" but not confine students to a religious education.",
      "\"A student in Oklahoma is free to choose a public school, correct? No student is required to attend a charter school, correct?\" he said.",
      "\"That's right,\" replied Gregory Garre, the attorney representing the state.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested that individual states opposed to religiously affiliated charter schools could tailor their laws to prevent that -- and potentially curtail a charter's independence.",
      "\"I can imagine some states might respond to a decision in your favor by imposing more requirements on charter schools,\" Gorsuch said to attorney James Campbell representing the plaintiffs.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts posed critical questions of both sides. At one point, Roberts opined that a St. Isidore charter school would pose a striking \"comprehensive involvement\" between church and state.

      "\"How is that different from what we have here?\" Roberts asked Oklahoma attorney Gregory Garre. \"You have an education program, and you want to not allow them to participate with a religious entity.\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused from the case last year but did not explain her decision. Veteran court watchers have noted her close ties to the University of Notre Dame and personal relationships with law professors there who are involved in the case.",

      "A closely watched inflation gauge cooled last month in a sign that prices were steadily easing before most of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs were implemented",
      "WASHINGTON -- A closely watched inflation gauge cooled last month in a sign that prices were steadily easing before most of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs were implemented.",
      "At the same time, consumers accelerated their spending, particularly on cars, likely in an effort to get ahead of the duties.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.3% in March from a year earlier, down from 2.7% in February. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6% compared with a year ago, below February\u2019s 3%. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The slowdown in inflation could be a temporary respite until the widespread duties imposed by Trump begin to push up prices in many categories. Most economists expect inflation to start picking up in the coming months.",
      "\u201cCore inflation will inevitably rebound sharply in the coming months,\u201d Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in an email. \u201cGoods prices will rise much more strongly.\u201d",
      "Chambers expects core inflation will near 4% by late this year.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s report also showed that consumer spending increased 0.7% from February to March, a healthy gain. Much of the increase appeared to be driven by efforts to get ahead of duties, such as Trump's 25% duty on imported cars, which took effect April 3. Spending on autos surged 8.1% in March. Still, that means auto sales are likely to fade in the coming months because those assets have already been secured.",
      "But spending on restaurants and hotels also jumped after falling in February, a sign Americans are still willing to splurge a little on travel and dining out.",
      "The spending increase is noteworthy because consumer confidence surveys have plunged for several months, suggesting Americans have grown increasingly worried about the economy. Yet so far, that hasn't translated into a noticeable slowdown in spending.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, the government reported that consumer spending slowed in the first three months of the year, compared with last year\u2019s final quarter, as bad weather depressed shopping and Americans took a breather after healthy spending over the winter holidays.",
      "The nation\u2019s economy actually shrank 0.3% in the January-March quarter as imports surged as companies sought to get ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Trump benefited in last year\u2019s election from broad dissatisfaction among voters about the steep rise in prices that began in 2021 and that, on average, pushed prices up about 25% by the middle of last year. Grocery costs shot up nearly 30%. As a candidate, Trump said he would immediately lower prices if elected.",
      "Yet the president has slapped 25% duties on steel and aluminum, as well as cars, and a 10% tariff on nearly all other imports. And China, the United States\u2019 third-largest trading partner, now faces a 145% duty on its exports.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve target a 2% inflation rate and pay close attention to Wednesday\u2019s inflation gauge, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index. The better-known consumer price index was released earlier this month and also showed a steady decline.",
      "Inflation figures were revised higher for January and February, leaving price increases in the first quarter higher than previously estimated. The higher figures would likely leave Fed officials wary of cutting rates soon even before taking tariffs into account.",
      "Trump has pushed the Fed to cut its key short-term interest rate because inflation has cooled. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has underscored that the central bank is likely to remain on the sidelines as officials gauge how tariffs will impact the economy. The Fed isn\u2019t expected to lower its rate at its policy meeting next week.",

      "Federal prosecutors on Monday applied the additional charge for incursions into the recently designated New Mexico National Defense Area against migrants detained by Customs and Border Protection, as the military scales up troop deployments to a sliver of U.S. borderlands that is now being treated as an extension of U.S. Army Garrison Fort Huachuca in Arizona.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk has for years made Texas a business home and playground, launching rockets, building cars, and dreaming about creating a utopian enclave for his workers on the rural outskirts of the state capital.",
      "Now, a new Musk project is on the brink of victory: an election Saturday to officially turn a small patch of coastal South Texas \u2014 home to his rocket company SpaceX \u2014 into a city known as Starbase.",
      "If Musk prevails \u2014 which appears likely, since the small number of residents eligible to vote include his employees \u2014 it will be a victory for the mega-billionaire whose popularity has waned since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts, and sunk more than $20 million into a failed effort to tip Wisconsin Supreme Court elections. Profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.",
      "As of Tuesday, nearly 200 of 283 eligible voters had already cast an early ballot, according to county election records. The list of names so far does not include Musk, who voted in the county in the November elections.",
      "The cosmic dateline sounds like a billionaire\u2019s vanity project in an area where the man and his galactic dreams already enjoy broad support from residents and state and local officials. But there are creeping concerns that the city vote and companion efforts at the state Legislature will give Musk and his company town too much control over access to a popular swimming and camping area known for generations as the \u201cpoor people's beach.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s vote to establish Starbase is seen as a done deal.",
      "The proposed city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest mid-century homes. The polling site is in a building on Memes St., a cheeky nod to Musk's social media company X.",
      "Musk first floated the idea of a Starbase city in 2021. SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they want a company town, and did not respond to messages seeking comment this week. But a fight over beach access highlights at least part of what could be at stake.",
      "SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base, requires closing a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.",
      "Closure currently requires collaboration with surrounding Cameron County. Two bills being considered by state lawmakers would move most of that responsibility to the the new city, just as the company seeks permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to increase the number of launches from five to 25 a year.",
      "SpaceX officials say the bills would streamline beach closures and operations at a company that has contracts with the Department of Defense and NASA for use of its heavy rocket Starship, including a goal to send astronauts back to the moon and eventually Mars.",
      "\u201cThis fully reusable rocket system keeps the U.S. ahead of global competitors like China, and its being developed right here in South Texas,\u201d SpaceX Vice President of Starship Legal and Regulatory Sheila McCorkle wrote to state lawmakers.

      "Dozens of people who identified themselves as SpaceX workers, scientists and engineers living in the area submitted identical statements: \u201cIt improves coordination around beach access during spaceflight activities without increasing closures. This is key to public safety and continued growth of the space industry in Texas.\u201d",
      "Others praised SpaceX's mission, jobs and investments in the area.",
      "Opponents countered that the state would be giving Musk and his company too much control over a beach that draws tens of thousands of visitors every year.",
      "Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino Jr., said the county has been a good steward for beach closures and that there is no need to move the authority to the new city.",

      "Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn't comply with an order to evacuate the beach. But that measure would only take effect if beach closure authority is shifted to the new city.",

      "In her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, Harris said she\u2019s inspired by Americans fighting Trump\u2019s agenda despite threats to their freedom or livelihood.",
      "\u201cInstead of an administration working to advance America\u2019s highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\u201d Harris said a day after Trump reached 100 days in office.",
      "Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November.",
      "In a 15-minute speech, she spoke to the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office but discouraged despair.",
      "\u201cThey are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others. But what they have overlooked is that fear is not the only thing that\u2019s contagious,\u201d Harris said. \u201cCourage is contagious.\u201d",
      "Trump went after Harris in a campaign-style rally Tuesday marking his 100th day in office. He sarcastically called her a \u201cgreat border czar\" and a \u201cgreat candidate,\" and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign.",
      "Until Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket last summer, Trump said, \u201cI knew nothing about her.\"",
      "Harris cautioned Americans against viewing Trump\u2019s administration as merely chaotic, casting it instead as a \u201chigh-velocity event,\u201d the culmination of extensive work on the right to remake government.",
      "\u201cA vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making,\" Harris said. \u201cAn agenda to slash public education. An agenda to shrink government and then privatize its services. All while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among us.\u201d",
      "Harris chose a friendly audience for her return to the political arena, addressing the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office. It grew in part from Harris\u2019 run for San Francisco district attorney in the early 2000s.",
      "The speech was delivered below luminous chandeliers in a gold-trimmed ballroom in the landmark Palace Hotel.",
      "Harris is ramping up her public presence as Democrats nationally search for a path forward after November's election, in which Republicans also won control of Congress. While a slate of high-profile Democrats \u2014 from governors to businessmen \u2014 seek leadership roles within the party, the former vice president retains unique influence and would reshape any future race she chooses to enter.",
      "She praised Democrats who have been especially prolific in criticizing Trump, name-dropping lawmakers diverse in their ideology and style: Sens. Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy and Bernie Sanders along with Reps. Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "But she did not take a stand in one of her party's central divides, neither calling for mass mobilization like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker or questioning Democratic positioning on key issues like California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here tonight to offer all the answers,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut I am here to say this: You are not alone and we are all in this together.\u201d",
      "But she warned that things will probably get worse before they get better.",
      "\u201cThe one check, the one balance, the one power that must not fail is the voice of the people,\u201d she said.",
      "Harris, a former state attorney general and U.S. senator from California, has not discouraged speculation that she might enter the race to replace the term-limited Newsom, himself a potential contender for president. And she has not ruled out another run for the White House.",

      "She continues to fundraise, using a joint committee that includes Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties. The committee, the Harris Victory Fund, reported having about $4.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to federal records.",
      "In recent fundraising emails, Harris has been blunt about the need for Democrats to unify ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Democrats need to \u201corganize and stop Trump\u2019s agenda while electing Democrats everywhere,\u201d she wrote in recent emails. \u201cThere has never been a more important time for a strong Democratic Party \u2014 one that is willing to stand up to Donald Trump, Elon Musk and what they are doing to this country.\u201d",
      "The event marks a homecoming of sorts. Harris lives in Los Angeles but she is from the San Francisco Bay Area, where her political career is rooted. For her first major speech since the election, she chose familiar terrain and a friendly, in some ways familial, crowd.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. defense officials say the number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year and there was a significant drop in the Army",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of sexual assaults reported across the U.S. military dipped by nearly 4% last year, fueled by a significant drop in the Army, The Associated Press has learned. It was the second year in a row with a decrease, reversing a troubling trend that has plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade.",
      "Senior U.S. defense officials said that while the decline is a good sign, the number of reported assaults is still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime.",
      "According to the officials, there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023. In 2022, there were 8,942 reported sexual assaults, a spike that triggered widespread alarm and led to new programs and an infusion of funding to try to combat the problem.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not been publicly released.",
      "According to data obtained by the AP, the overall decrease was due to a 13% drop in reported sexual assaults across the Army, which is the largest military service.",
      "All the other services saw increases. The Navy had the largest jump of 4.3%, while the Air Force had a 2.2% increase and the Marine Corps rose by less than 1%.",
      "Of the 8,195 total, there were 512 service members who reported an assault that happened before they entered the military. The Pentagon encourages reporting so that victims can get any support they need. In addition, 641 were civilians who said they were assaulted by a member of the military.",
      "While reported assaults decreased, the number of sexual harassment complaints went from 2,980 in 2023 to 3,014 last year. Most were filed by female service members, and the vast majority of those accused were male.",
      "The latest report also reflects the first full year since new prosecution procedures have been in place, putting independent lawyers in charge of those decisions and sidelining commanders after years of pressure from Congress.",
      "The change, long resisted by Pentagon leaders, was finally forced by frustrated lawmakers who believed that too often commanders would fail to take victims\u2019 complaints seriously or would try to protect alleged perpetrators in their units.",
      "Officials said it is too soon to tell what effect those changes are having on the prosecution process.",
      "The number of cases in which misconduct was substantiated increased a bit last year over the 2023 total. The number of discharges and administrative actions against alleged perpetrators continued to increase, and court-martial charges declined \u2014 both trends going back several years.",
      "Officials noted that nearly three-quarters of the court-martial cases ended in convictions, a slight increase over the previous year.",
      "Sexual assault reports in the military have gone up for much of the past decade, except for a tiny decrease in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Officials say they are optimistic about the recent decreases but say much more work needs to be done.",
      "While it is difficult to point to any one reason for the two-year decline, the Defense Department has been making a series of changes over the past year that officials say may be contributing to the shift. The services are using an infusion of more than $1 billion to improve programs and hire up to 2,500 personnel as part of a new \u201cprevention workforce\u201d and place them at military installations around the world.",
      "So far, about 1,400 have been hired for that work, but that process has stalled this year due to the Trump administration\u2019s budget and personnel cuts across the federal government. Defense officials said they are working to spread the existing workers around to lessen the gaps until more can be hired.",
      "The Pentagon releases a report every year on the number of sexual assaults reported by or about troops. But because sexual assault is a highly underreported crime, the department also does a confidential survey every two years to get a clearer picture of the problem. That survey, which is conducted online, came out last year, so it was not done this year.",
      "Last year\u2019s survey said more than 29,000 active-duty service members said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the previous year, compared with nearly 36,000 in the 2021 survey, according to several defense officials. The decrease was the first in eight years.",
      "But officials said the survey also indicates that a large number of service members never file a report.",
      "Defense officials have long argued that an increase in reported assaults is a positive trend because so many people are reluctant to report them, both in the military and in society as a whole. Greater reporting, they say, shows there is more confidence in the reporting system and greater comfort with the support for victims.",

      "U.S. officials say Kuwait has released 10 more American detainees in an apparent goodwill gesture",
      "WASHINGTON -- Kuwait has released an additional 10 American detainees, bringing to nearly two dozen the total number freed by the country in the past two months, U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "Taken together, Kuwait\u2019s pardons of 23 Americans since March \u2014 done as a goodwill gesture by the U.S. ally \u2014 amounted to the largest release of U.S. citizens by a single foreign country in years.",
      "The prisoners include military contractors and veterans held on drug charges and other offenses by the small, oil-rich nation. One detainee was said by supporters to have been coerced into signing a false confession and endured physical violence and threats against his wife and daughter.",
      "Ten others were released on March 12, weeks after a visit to Kuwait by Adam Boehler, who is serving as the Trump administration\u2019s envoy for hostage affairs.",
      "\u201cWe flew out, we sat down with the Kuwaitis, and they said, listen, no one\u2019s ever asked before at this level\u201d for the release of the Americans, Boehler told the AP.",
      "The releases were not done as part of a swap and the U.S. was not asked to give up anything in return.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been extremely responsive, and their view is the United States is a huge ally. They know it\u2019s a priority for (President Donald Trump) to bring Americans home,\u201d Boehler said. \u201cI credit it to the Kuwaiti understanding that we\u2019ve stood up for them historically and they know that these things are important for the president.\u201d",
      "The Americans \u201cmaintain their innocence, and it\u2019s important to note none of these cases had an identified victim, and all of them were built on supposed confessions taken in Arabic without translation,\u201d according to a statement from Jonathan Franks, a private consultant working on cases involving American hostages and detainees who represented nine of the 10 people released Wednesday. He spent weeks in the country trying to negotiate the releases.",
      "Kuwait is considered a major non-NATO ally of the U.S. The U.S. and Kuwait have had a close military partnership since America launched the 1991 Gulf War to expel Iraqi troops after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, with some 13,500 American troops stationed in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan and Ali al-Salem Air Base.",
      "But Kuwait also has detained many American military contractors on drug charges, in some cases for years. Their families have alleged that their loved ones faced abuse while imprisoned in a country that bans alcohol and has strict laws regarding drugs.",
      "Others have criticized Kuwaiti police for bringing trumped-up charges and manufacturing evidence used against them \u2014 allegations never acknowledged by the autocratic nation ruled by a hereditary emir.",
      "Among those freed Wednesday was Tony Holden, an HVAC technician. He was working as a defense contractor in support of Camp Arifjan at the time of his November 2022 arrest, when his family and supporters allege he was \u201cset up by corrupt Kuwaiti police looking to earn bonuses.\u201d",
      "His supporters say his wife and daughter were physically threatened, that he was coerced into signing a written confession in Arabic and was charged with drug possession despite testing negative in a drug test and abstaining for religious reasons from drug and alcohol use.",
      "\u201cTony was an innocent man when he was arrested, and he remains an innocent man today,\u201d says a website that was established to support him and advocate for his release.",
      "Added Secretary of State Marco Rubio: \u201cWe celebrate his release and return to the United States.\u201d",
      "A minor is also being released in the coming days but is expected to remain in Kuwait.",

      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has denied the U.S. government's request to release a former FBI informant while he appeals his case",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A federal judge has denied the U.S. government's request to release from prison a former FBI informant who made up a story about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter accepting bribes that later became central to Republicans\u2019 impeachment effort.",
      "The decision, issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles, comes weeks after a new prosecutor reassigned to Alexander Smirnov's case jointly filed a motion with his attorneys asking for his release while he appeals his conviction. In the motion, the U.S. government had said it would review its \u201ctheory of the case.\u201d",
      "Wright said in his written order that Smirnov is still flight risk, even if prosecutors say they will review his case.",
      "\"The fact remains that Smirnov has been convicted and sentenced to seventy-two months in prison, providing ample incentive to flee,\" he said.",
      "Smirnov, 44, was sentenced in January after pleading guilty to tax evasion and lying to the FBI about the phony bribery scheme, which was described by the previous prosecutors assigned to the case as an effort to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "His attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, told The Associated Press in a text that they will appeal the judge's decision and \u201ccontinue to advocate for Mr. Smirnov's release.\u201d The U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles declined to comment.",
      "Smirnov had been originally prosecuted by former Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who resigned in January days before President Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second term.",
      "Smirnov has been in custody since February 2024. He was arrested at the Las Vegas airport after returning to the U.S. from overseas.",
      "Smirnov, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, falsely claimed to his FBI handler that around 2015, executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid then-Vice President Biden and his son $5 million each.",
      "The explosive claim in 2020 came after Smirnov expressed \"bias\u201d about Biden as a presidential candidate, according to prosecutors at the time. In reality, investigators found Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017 \u2014 after Biden's term as vice president.",
      "Authorities said Smirnov's false claim \u201cset off a firestorm in Congress\u201d when it resurfaced years later as part of the House impeachment inquiry into Biden, who won the presidency over Trump in 2020. The Biden administration dismissed the impeachment effort as a \u201cstunt.\u201d",
      "Weiss also brought gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden, who was supposed to be sentenced in December after being convicted at a trial in the gun case and pleading guilty to tax charges. But he was pardoned by his father, who said he believed \u201craw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is calling for more reliance on behavioral therapy for transgender youth instead of broader gender-affirming medical care",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration released a lengthy review of transgender health care on Thursday that advocates for a greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming medical care for youths with gender dysmorphia.",
      "The Health and Human Services report questions standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and is likely to be used to bolster the government\u2019s abrupt shift in how to care for a subset of the population that has become a political lightning rod.",
      "This new \u201cbest practices\u201d report is in response to an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19.",
      "\u201cOur duty is to protect our nation\u2019s children \u2014 not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,\u201d National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. \u201cWe must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.\u201d",
      "HHS said its report, however, is not clinical guidance and does not make any policy recommendations. The report is also limited to children and does not address treatment for adults.",
      "Gender-affirming care for transgender youth under standards widely used in the U.S. includes supportive talk therapy and can \u2014 but does not always \u2014 involve puberty blockers or hormone treatment. Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender minors are rare.",
      "A judge has blocked key parts of Trump\u2019s order, which includes denying research and educational grants for medical schools, hospitals and other institutions that provide gender-affirming care to people 18 or younger. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care. The White House said Monday that since Trump took office, HHS has eliminated 215 grants totaling $477 million for research or education on gender-affirming treatment.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have also adopted bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling is pending after justices heard arguments in December in a case about whether states can enforce such laws.",
      "The Jan. 28 executive order is among several administration policies aimed at denying the existence of transgender people. Trump also has ordered the government to identify people as either male or female rather than accept a concept of gender in which people fall along a spectrum, remove transgender service members from the military, and bar transgender women and girls from sports competitions that align with their gender. This month, HHS issued guidance to protect whistleblowers who report doctors or hospitals providing gender-affirming care. Judges are blocking enforcement of several of the policies.",
      "This latest HHS report, which Trump called for while campaigning last year, represents a reversal in federal policy. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS, found that no research had determined that behavioral health interventions could change someone\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation. The 2023 update to the 2015 finding is no longer on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "The administration says this new report will go through a peer-review process. In the meantime, it\u2019s not saying who contributed to it, \u201cin order to help maintain the integrity of this process.\u201d",
      "The report says that medical groups have relied on medical treatment rather than behavioral therapy for transgender youth partly because of a \u201cmischaracterization of such approaches as \u2018conversion therapy,\u2019\u201d which about half the states have banned for minors.",
      "The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has said that evidence shows conversion therapies inflict harm on young people, including elevated rates of suicidal ideation. And the American Medical Association has urged states not to ban gender-affirming care for minors, saying that \u201cempirical evidence has demonstrated that trans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.\u201d",

      "The justices are taking up appeals filed by the St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School and the state charter school board after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the school would entangle church and state in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself without explanation. Barrett previously taught law at Notre Dame and is close friends with Notre Dame law professor Nicole Garnett, a leading proponent of publicly funded religious charter schools. Even without Barrett, the court's conservative majority could find that the taxpayer-funded school is in line with a string of high court decisions that have allowed public funds to flow to religious entities. Those rulings were based on a different part of the First Amendment that protects religious freedom.",
      "Liberal justices have complained that those decisions have eaten away at the separation of church and state.",
      "The case comes to the court amid efforts, mainly in conservative-led states, to insert religion into public schools. Those include a challenged Louisiana requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms and a mandate from Oklahoma\u2019s state schools superintendent that the Bible be placed in public school classrooms.",
      "St. Isidore, a K-12 online school, had planned to start classes for its first 200 enrollees last fall, with part of its mission to evangelize its students in the Catholic faith.",

      "A key issue in the case is whether the school is public or private. Charter schools are deemed public in Oklahoma and the other 45 states and the District of Columbia where they operate.",
      "They are free and open to all, receive state funding, abide by antidiscrimination laws and submit to oversight of curriculum and testing. But they also are run by independent boards that are not part of local public school systems.",
      "Just under 4 million American schoolchildren, about 8%, are enrolled in charter schools.",

      "\u201cI cannot adequately express to this community the level of stupidity and lack of judgment involved in this case,\u201d Fitzpatrick told reporters Tuesday evening.",
      "Fitzpatrick said a person driving five younger players on the team pretended to get lost, pulled over in a place where other participants in the prank lay in wait, armed with at least one knife and a weapon that appeared to be a gun.",

    "story": [
      "Not long after a Norfolk Southern train derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio in February 2023 the railroad started to repeat its promise that it would \u201cmake it right\u201d in East Palestine",
      "Norfolk Southern began making promises to East Palestine, Ohio, soon after its train derailed and caught fire in February 2023, saying it would \u201cmake it right\u201d after five tank cars of vinyl chloride were intentionally burned, sending up a huge black plume of smoke that spread more toxic chemicals over homes, schools and farms.",
      "A lawsuit filed by the school district Wednesday adds to doubts about the railroad's commitment after plans for a student wellness center stalled. Some residents also point to Norfolk Southern's attempts to force other companies to help pay for its $600 million class-action settlement and its agreement to abandon a training center for first responders that was meant to help the village recover.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of empty promises were made,\u201d said lifelong resident Krissy Ferguson. She recently moved her family away to Poland, Ohio, saying her home in East Palestine still doesn't feel safe.",
      "Of course, not everyone feels exactly the same way. East Palestine 's people remain deeply divided: While some complain about lingering respiratory problems, rashes and other unexplained symptoms that raise long-term health concerns, many others say they feel fine and want to put the disaster behind them.",
      "\u201cFrom the village's perspective, Norfolk Southern is meeting the expectations outlined in our agreements,\u201d a village spokeswoman said. \u201cThat's all we can say at this time.\u201d",
      "East Palestine and the railroad announced a $22 million settlement in January that included $13.5 million already paid to the town and formalized the railroad's additional $25 million pledge to renovating the village's park. Without offering explanations or details, the joint statement said both sides agreed the promised training center isn't feasible.",
      "Norfolk Southern estimates that it has committed more than $115 million to help residents and communities in the area recover, including $1.1 million paid to the school district. That doesn't include the class-action settlement or the more than $1.1 billion the railroad has spent on the cleanup.",
      "But the school district isn't satisfied. Its lawsuit accuses the railroad of failing to reimburse the schools for using its buildings during the disaster and abandoning construction of the community wellness center. The derailment also caused more than 200 students to transfer \u2014 25% of the district's enrollment \u2014 which cost more than $1 million in lost state and federal funding last year alone. And property and income tax revenues have dropped, leaving future school finances uncertain.",
      "\u201cTo abruptly walk away, it says a lot about what a corporation can do to a community,\u201d Superintendent James Rook said.",
      "The schools' center, with an estimated price tag of $30 million, was meant to offer health and wellness care and job training for students, the lawsuit said. Norfolk Southern even hired an architect and construction firm to design it, but the project stalled last year.",
      "Rook said the wellness center was supposed to be the centerpiece of Norfolk Southern\u2019s commitment to fixing the mess. \u201cPeople were very excited, still are, about the potential of it,\" he said.",
      "The railroad insists there has been no change in its commitments. The derailment became the worst North American rail disaster in a decade after the officials blew open the vinyl chloride tanks, forcing evacuations as the plastic ingredient burned, generating new chemicals that later fell to the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board found the venting was unnecessary.",
      "Norfolk Southern maintains its www.nsmakingitright.com website, based on the phrase former CEO Alan Shaw repeated in testimony to Congress and in community meetings and interviews. Shaw was fired last fall for having an inappropriate consensual relationship with a railroad executive.",
      "\u201cFrom the outset, we have been clear about our commitment to do right by the community in East Palestine. We remain focused on taking meaningful action that aligns with community priorities,\" a railroad statement said.",
      "Current CEO Mark George said after taking over that Norfolk Southern will follow through on all its promises, and he's visited East Palestine several times.",
      "But residents like Misti Allison say it doesn't feel like \u201cmaking it right\u201d when the railroad refuses to pay for cost overruns beyond its $25 million pledge to the park project. She said people are also mourning the loss of the training center for first responders, which would have brought jobs to town and helped firefighters throughout the region prepare to handle rail disasters.",
      "\u201cNow that Alan Shaw is gone and there is a new CEO in place, all the board cares about is getting those shares as high as possible and to be able to make it right for their shareholders,\" Allison said. \u201cAnd if the East Palestine community is a casualty in that, then so be it. This is yet another example of putting profits over people.\u201d",
      "Most of the class-action payments remain on hold because of appeals, adding to frustration in the village. Some personal injury payments have been trickling out, but many residents have complained about the amounts. The court system is the reason for those payment delays, but many blame the railroad nevertheless.",
      "The village's leaders are trying to build on the positives, said Barb Kliner, a retired chief financial officer for a different school district, but she said \"the feeling among the people that I associate with and the older folks in town is just kind of disappointment.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have a support role, which I\u2019m permitted to have,\u201d he said. In a podcast interview cited by the board, DiClaudio discussed decisions about pricing, ingredients, salary levels for employees and competing restaurants.",
      "\u201cI don't mind charging $19, because I'm giving you a better quality steak,\u201d DiClaudio said on the podcast.",
      "Lately, he said, health issues and the demands of having a young child have limited his time in the business. As a criminal court judge, his focus these days is on court actions filed by defendants after they have been convicted.",
      "The Judicial Conduct Board investigates and prosecutes possible instances of judge misconduct in Pennsylvania. The case will be heard by the Court of Judicial Discipline.",
      "The board complaint notes that news coverage of the restaurant in Philadelphia, where cheesesteaks are the subject of perpetual public interest, has noted he is a judge. One story referred to him as \u201cwhiz honor\u201d \u2014 a reference to the use of Cheez Whiz on some cheesesteaks.",
      "If anything, DiClaudio said, his role in the restaurant may be improving the image of judges in the minds of his fellow Philadelphians, giving them \u201cconfidence in the judiciary \u2014 that we're not all robots.\u201d",
      "Shay's Steaks is named for his late mother and the luncheonette his parents ran for more than two decades in South Philly.",
      "The complaint references several news stories about the restaurant that describe him as a judge.",
      "\u201cI had no idea what they were going to write,\" DiClaudio said. \"I had no say in the editing process until I saw it myself.\u201d",
      "He noted a sign at the restaurant states Jackee DiClaudio is the owner \u2014 the couple lives in the same building as the restaurant. He said Shay's Steaks has never used an image of him in judicial robes or described him as a judge in advertising materials. He says he's never been paid for his work there, and that the profits go to his wife.",
      "DiClaudio is accused of falling short of a requirement that judges always act in a way that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Another allegation is that he violated a rule that judges \u201cnot abuse the prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic interests of the judge or others, or allow others to do so.\u201d",
      "County judges such as DiClaudio may not have other employment that would in any way interfere with their judicial duties and responsibilities, said Sam Stretton, a prominent judicial ethics lawyer. He has represented DiClaudio in the past, and may again in the current matter.",
      "\u201cHe's very proud of his wife and what she's doing there,\u201d Stretton said. \u201cSure, he gives input but I don't see that as being prohibited. The issue he's got to deal with is: Is there self-promotion here?\u201d",
      "Complicating the case is that DiClaudio is currently on probation under a decision by the Court of Judicial Discipline that involved tax liens and an unpaid bill. He was found to have not acknowledged debt on his financial disclosure forms and did not obey court orders, leading to repeated contempt citations against him, the court said.",
      "He was suspended without pay for two weeks, so in order to qualify for a pension and retiree health care he needs to serve two additional weeks after his term expires in January 2026. A Democrat, he is seeking retention to another 10-year term. If he wins retention he says he is considering retiring early next year.",

      "A suspect whom authorities have linked to white supremacist movements has been arrested in the March 2019 fire that destroyed an office at a storied Tennessee social justice center",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A suspect whom authorities have linked to white supremacist movements has been arrested in the March 2019 fire that destroyed an office at a storied Tennessee social justice center.",
      "Regan Prater was arrested last Thursday and charged with one count of arson.",
      "An affidavit filed in federal court in East Tennessee says Prater's posts in several group chats affiliated with white supremacist organizations connect him to the blaze at the Highlander Research and Education Center in New Market. In one private message, a witness who sent screenshots to the FBI asked a person authorities believe is Prater whether he set the fire.",
      "\u201cI'm not admitting anything,\u201d the person using the screen name \u201cRooster\u201d wrote. But he later went on to describe exactly how the fire was set with \u201ca sparkler bomb and some Napalm.\u201d",
      "A white-power symbol was spray-painted on the pavement near the site of the fire. The affidavit describes it as a \u201ctriple cross\u201d and says it was also found on one of the firearms used by a shooter who killed 51 people at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, 2019, about two weeks before the Highlander fire.",
      "Prater was previously sentenced to five years in federal prison for setting another fire in June 2019 at an adult video and novelty store in East Tennessee. He pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay $106,000 in restitution in that case. At the scene of that fire, investigators found a cellphone they later determined belonged to Prater. The phone included a short video showing a person inside the store lighting an accelerant, according to the affidavit.",
      "The federal public defender listed as representing Prater did not respond to an email and phone message requesting comment.",
      "The blaze at Highlander broke out in the early morning of March 29, 2019. No one was injured. The building that burned was part of a complex and it housed decades' worth of irreplaceable documents, artifacts, speeches and other materials from different eras including the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "In an interview, Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, a former co-executive director at Highlander, recalled arriving at the scene of the fire to discover some priceless items from the administrative office still smoldering.",
      "\u201cEvery time the wind blew, we would see what was left of it go up in flames again, for weeks,\u201d Woodard Henderson said.",
      "The trauma of the ordeal was compounded by a feeling that, despite early signs that the culprit had ties to white supremacist movements, authorities were opaque about the investigation, Woodard Henderson said.",
      "\u201cWe were told that it was like finding a needle in the haystack to prove who did it \u2014 that that\u2019s in fact the point of an arson,\u201d she said. \u201cYou've got to remember this was 2019, so Donald Trump was still in his first presidency. Frankly, for years, we didn\u2019t get any updates.\u201d",
      "A week after the incident, Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, of Memphis, called for a federal probe. He also called on more government funding to counter an uptick in hate crimes and white nationalism nationwide.",
      "Woodard Henderson said authorities informed Highlander's leaders in 2022 that they were indeed victims of a hate-motivated attack.",
      "Highlander is known as a place where Civil Rights icons such as Rosa Parks and John Lewis received training. Parks attended a workshop there on integration in 1955, about six months before she famously refused to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. She always credited Highlander with helping her become a more determined activist.",
      "Parks returned to Highlander two years later with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. for the school\u2019s 25th anniversary celebration, where King gave a keynote address on achieving freedom and equality through nonviolence.",
      "First established in Monteagle in 1932 as a center for union organizing, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was among its early supporters.",
      "Highlander\u2019s co-founder and longtime leader, Myles Horton, a white man, created a place that was unique in the Jim Crow South, where activists white and Black could build and strengthen alliances. In his memoir, Congressman Lewis wrote of how eye-opening being at Highlander was.",
      "Highlander \u201cwas the first time in my life that I saw black people and white people not just sitting down together at long tables for shared meals, but also cleaning up together afterward, doing the dishes together, gathering together late into the night in deep discussion,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cThat paved the way for Highlander\u2019s work around the Civil Rights Movement, or the Black Freedom Struggle, as we should rightly call it,\u201d said Allyn Steele, a co-executive director of Highlander.",
      "Highlander turns 93 this year and, six years past the fire, it expects to complete a rebuild of its administrative office, Steele said.",
      "Woodard Henderson said the arson attack on the center has never deterred it from its mission.",
      "\u201cI think if their goal was to break our spirit, they failed miserably,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything, it reminded us that there\u2019s a collective responsibility in our movements to keep each other safe.\u201d",

      "Justice Pat DeWine, the governor's son, joined the three Republican justices elected in November \u2014 Joseph Deters, Megan Shanahan and Dan Hawkins \u2014 in reinstating enforcement of the law. Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy, and Justices Jennifer Brunner and Pat Fischer dissented.",

      "The litigation was filed in March 2024 by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but it specifically discriminates against them accessing it by allowing the use of identical medications for other purposes.",
      "They lost at the trial court level, but later succeeded in getting the law temporarily blocked by a panel of the 10th District Court of Appeals, which reversed the lower court judge\u2019s decision allowing the law to go into effect, on grounds it \u201creasonably limits parents\u2019 rights.\u201d",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Republican South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis appears likely to stay in office for at least the rest of the year.",
      "The Republican-dominated House has decided not to take up a resolution passed by the Senate to kick Loftis out of office because of his role in a phantom $1.8 billion account that showed up on the state\u2019s books but had barely any real money in it and the failure to report it to lawmakers for years.",
      "The Senate sent the resolution to remove Loftis to the House on April 21. House Speaker Murrell Smith said there just isn't enough time to take it up before the session ends May 8.",
      "\u201cWe're going to concentrate on passing legislation now and we'll make a decision after session concludes on the path forward with the treasurer,\u201d Smith told South Carolina Public Radio.",
      "The decision leaves Loftis open to run for a fifth four-year term in 2026. One of his arguments to stay in office was it wasn't fair to overturn the results of an election.",
      "\u201cI am grateful for the House leadership\u2019s decision today to choose the people\u2019s business over political theatre. I feel sure that South Carolinians are thankful that they are the first priority, and political games are not. I am ready to turn my focus back to doing the people\u2019s work,\u201d Loftis wrote in a statement.",
      "The Senate voted 33-8 to remove Loftis after an extraordinary hearing with 23 Republicans voting yes. It was the culmination of over two years of investigation by senators that began when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion.",
      "That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn\u2019t balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousands of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grew to $1.8 billion.",
      "It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the money was not real cash but just an accumulation of errors.",
      "Loftis has called the Senate investigation a witch hunt. He repeatedly said no money went missing and the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state\u2019s strong credit rating.",
      "Just because eight Republican senators voted against the resolution doesn't mean they back Loftis. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said he simply thought his fellow senators did not make a strong enough case to remove him from office.",
      "\u201cI'd vote for a monkey over Curtis Loftis. I think he has no business being treasurer and my hope is Republicans will put up a good candidate to run against him,\" Massey said.",
      "This is the first year of a two year session, so the resolution to dump Loftis, which is currently in a House committee, will stay alive when lawmakers return to Columbia in 2026.",

      "Footage of the beating was captured by a police pole camera and also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. His death led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the U.S. and directed intense scrutiny toward the police force in Memphis, a majority-Black city.",
      "Mills and another officer involved in the beating, Emmitt Martin, have agreed to plead guilty to the state charges and are not standing trial with their ex-colleagues under deals with prosecutors. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.",
      "Mills testified Tuesday that he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols' death three days later from what an autopsy described as blunt force trauma.",

      "\u201cDo you regret that?\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Mills said.",
      "Under cross-examination, Mills said Nichols was actively resisting arrest and not complying with repeated orders to give officers his hands so that he could be handcuffed.",
      "Defense attorney John Keith Perry asked Mills if he would have struck Nichols with the baton if Nichols had just put his hands behind his back. Mills said no.",
      "Perry also asked Mills if he thought Bean and Smith were holding Nichols so that Martin could hit Nichols. Mills said he didn\u2019t think that was the case.",
      "Martin Zummach, Smith's attorney, asked Mills if an officer is safe if a suspect is not handcuffed and searched for a weapon. Mills said they were not safe in that circumstance. Nichols was not searched before he ran from the traffic stop.",

      "\u201cDo you need to wait for somebody to produce a weapon to do something?\u201d Zummach asked Mills.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Mills said.",

      "During the War of 1812, townsfolk in the tiny fishing village hurled rocks at British soldiers using their stockings as slings. Now, they\u2019re slinging trash bags and towels over the side mirrors of their cars to protect them from a destructive and determined pileated woodpecker.",
      "Over the last few weeks, the bird has broken more than two dozen mirrors and at least one vehicle\u2019s side window. But residents are taking the violence in stride.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s having a good laugh about it,\u201d said Ben Favaloro. \u201cNobody wants harm to the bird. He\u2019s always welcome back.\u201d",
      "Favaloro, who has lived in the neighborhood for nearly four decades, said he\u2019s seen the occasional woodpecker on the side of houses in years past and he removed several trees last summer that were damaged beyond recovery. But the attacking of glass is a new phenomenon.",
      "\u201cInitially, we just noticed that all the mirrors had been adjusted. It looked like maybe there\u2019s a child in the neighborhood that was going around pushing the mirrors down,\u201d he said. But then his sister-in-law spotted the roughly 21-inch (53-centimeter) tall woodpecker on Favaloro\u2019s truck, pecking at the side mirror.",
      "Given their enormous size, piliated woodpeckers are plenty strong enough to break mirrors, but such behavior is \u201cdefinitely weird,\u201d said Pamela Hunt, senior biologist for avian conservation at the New Hampshire Audubon.",
      "\u201cLots of birds will be aggressive against reflections in mirrors, but I don\u2019t usually hear about woodpeckers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t usually peck at their opponents, they kind of chase them around.\u201d",
      "She said the woodpecker might be \u201ca little stupid\u201d and is trying to defend its territory and scare away what it sees as competition. The damage coincides with the mating season for pileated woodpeckers and resident Barbara Smith said she\u2019d be fine with \u201clots of little woodpeckers\u201d around, though she hopes they won't be as destructive.",
      "\u201cWoodpeckers have to do what woodpeckers do,\u201d she said. \u201cGood luck, woodpecker.\u201d",

      "THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Police in Greece have arrested a 21-year-old American citizen wanted by U.S. authorities for allegedly participating in an online network dedicated to the sexual exploitation of minors, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The suspect was taken into custody Tuesday in the city of Thessaloniki, based on an international arrest warrant and extradition request by the United States. He was not named in accordance with Greek law.",
      "U.S. prosecutors describe the organization behind the network as nihilistic and violent, with links to the sexual abuse of minors and the online distribution of exploitative material.",
      "The alleged offenses occurred between December 2023 and April of this year and are also punishable under Greek law, Greek police said in a statement.",
      "The suspect appeared before an appellate prosecutor on Wednesday. He denies all allegations and has formally opposed extradition, according to Greek judicial authorities.",
      "He will remain in custody until a court of appeals decides in the coming weeks whether to grant the U.S. extradition request.",

      "An Army combat veteran whose Gulf War experience triggered severe mental problems is facing scheduled execution in Florida this week for the shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children in 1998",
      "STARKE, Fla. -- An Army combat veteran whose Gulf War experience triggered severe mental problems is scheduled to be executed Thursday in Florida for the shotgun killings of his girlfriend and her three young children in 1998.",
      "Barring a last-minute reprieve, Jeffrey Hutchinson is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. Thursday at Florida State Prison near Starke. The execution, if carried out, will be the fourth in Florida this year under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, with a fifth execution planned for May 15.",
      "Hutchinson, 62, has long claimed he is innocent and that two unknown assailants perpetrated the killings as part of a U.S. government conspiracy aimed at silencing him over his activism on claims of Gulf War illnesses and other issues affecting veterans. Hutchinson served eight years in the Army, part of it as an elite Ranger.",
      "Court records, however, show that on the night of the murders in Crestview, Florida, Hutchinson had argued with his girlfriend, 32-year-old Renee Flaherty, then packed his clothes and guns into a truck. Hutchinson went to a bar and drank some beer, telling staff there that Flaherty was angry with him before leaving abruptly.",
      "A short time later, a male caller told a 911 operator \u201cI just shot my family\u201d from the house Hutchinson and Flaherty shared with the three children: 9-year-old Geoffrey, 7-year-old Amanda, and 4-year-old Logan. All were killed with a 12-gauge shotgun that was found on a kitchen counter. Hutchinson was located by police in the garage with a phone still connected to the 911 center and gunshot residue on his hands.",
      "At his 2001 trial, Hutchinson based his defense on a claim that two unknown men came to the house, killing Flaherty and the children after he struggled with them. A jury found Hutchinson guilty of four counts of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to life in prison for Flaherty's killing and three death sentences for the children.",
      "Since then, Hutchinson has undertaken numerous unsuccessful appeals, many focused on mental health problems linked to his Army service. In late April, his lawyers sought to delay his execution date by claiming Hutchinson is insane and therefore cannot be put to death.",
      "Bradford County Circuit Judge James Colaw rejected that argument.",
      "\u201cThis Court finds that Jeffrey Hutchinson does not have any current mental illness,\u201d Colaw said in his April 27 order. \u201cThis Court finds that Mr. Hutchinson's purported delusion is demonstrably false. Jeffrey Hutchinson does not lack the mental capacity to understand the reason for the pending execution.\u201d",
      "In their court filings, Hutchinson's lawyers said he suffers from Gulf War Illness \u2014 a series of health problems stemming from the 1990-1991 war in Iraq \u2014 as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia related to his claim that he was targeted by government surveillance.",
      "One of his lawyers, Chelsea Shirley, said Hutchinson has \u201ca decades-long delusion that he is being executed to silence his efforts to expose government secrets. Two experts have concluded that he is not competent for execution. Based on these facts, we believe the court was wrong to find Mr. Hutchinson competent to be executed, but we are not surprised.\u201d",
      "Florida\u2019s lethal injection protocol uses a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",
      "So far this year, 14 people have been executed in the U.S., including three in Florida, with Hutchinson to become the fourth. A fifth Florida execution is scheduled May 15 for Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing a woman at a motel in 1997. Rogers was also convicted of another woman's murder in California and is believed by investigators to have killed others around the country.",

      "California's population has increased for the second year in a row",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California \u2019s population climbed above 39.5 million in 2024, marking the second year of growth following a string of declines in the nation\u2019s most populous state during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The population rose an estimated 1%, adding 108,000 people compared to 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said Thursday. The increase is due in part to the number of births outpacing deaths and a boost in the number of adults 65 and older. The state said it also had better data to account for increases in legal immigration into the state from other countries.",
      "About one in nine people living in the United States reside in California.",
      "The Democratic governor touted the population gains as a sign of the state\u2019s growing economy, which is one of the largest in the world. The size of the state's economy has now surpassed that of Japan, which puts it only behind the U.S. as a whole, China and Germany, Newsom's office announced last week.",
      "\u201cPeople from across the nation and the globe are coming to the Golden State to pursue the California Dream, where rights are protected and people are respected,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cRegions throughout California are growing, strengthening local communities and boosting our state\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "But Republicans in the Democrat-dominated state and beyond have taken aim at California's population declines in the past and the loss of its residents to Texas, which previously made up the largest state-to-state movement in the U.S., according to U.S. Census data.",
      "Critics have tied past population decreases in the Golden State to the relentless homelessness crisis and rising cost of living. California has some of the highest housing, gas and utility prices in the country.",
      "The population rose in nine of the 10 largest counties, with Los Angeles County increasing by 28,000 compared to 2023. In Contra Costa, the state\u2019s ninth most populous county which is part of the San Francisco Bay Area, the number of residents fell by just two dozen.",
      "In Mono, a small county located on the California-Nevada border around Yosemite National Park, the population fell by about 1.6%.",

    "story": [
      "Visa is hoping to hand your credit card to an artificial intelligence \u201cagent\u201d that can find and buy clothes, groceries, airplane tickets and other items on your behalf",
      "Artificial intelligence \u201cagents\u201d are supposed to be more than chatbots. The tech industry has spent months pitching AI personal assistants that know what you want and can do real work on your behalf.",
      "So far, they're not doing much.",
      "Visa hopes to change that by giving them your credit card. Set a budget and some preferences and these AI agents \u2014 successors to ChatGPT and its chatbot peers \u2014 could find and buy you a sweater, weekly groceries or an airplane ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think this could be really important,\u201d said Jack Forestell, Visa\u2019s chief product and strategy officer, in an interview. \u201cTransformational, on the order of magnitude of the advent of e-commerce itself.\u201d",
      "Visa announced Wednesday it is partnering with a group of leading AI chatbot developers \u2014 among them U.S. companies Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI and Perplexity, and France's Mistral \u2014 to connect their AI systems to Visa's payments network. Visa is also working with IBM, online payment company Stripe and phone-maker Samsung on the initiative. Pilot projects begin Wednesday, ahead of more widespread usage expected next year.",
      "The San Francisco payment processing company is betting that what seems futuristic now could become a convenient alternative to our most mundane shopping tasks in the near future. It has spent the past six months working with AI developers to address technical obstacles that must be overcome before the average consumer is going to use it.",
      "For emerging AI companies, Visa's backing could also boost their chances of competing with tech giants Amazon and Google, which dominate digital commerce and are developing their own AI agents.",
      "The tech industry is already full of demonstrations of the capabilities of what it calls agentic AI, though few are yet found in the real world. Most are still refashioned versions of large language models \u2014 the generative AI technology behind chatbots that can write emails, summarize documents or help people code. Trained on huge troves of data, they can scour the internet and bring back recommendations for things to buy, but they have a harder time going beyond that.",
      "\u201cThe early incarnations of agent-based commerce are starting to do a really good job on the shopping and discovery dimension of the problem, but they are having tremendous trouble on payments,\u201d Forestell said. \u201cYou get to this point where the agents literally just turn it back around and say, \u2018OK, you go buy it.\u2019",
      "Visa sees itself as having a key role in giving AI agents easier and trusted access to the cash they need to make purchases.",
      "\u201cThe payments problem is not something the AI platforms can solve by themselves,\" Forestell said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we started working with them.\u201d",
      "The new AI initiative comes nearly a year after Visa revealed major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S., making physical cards and their 16-digit numbers increasingly irrelevant.",
      "Many consumers are already getting used to digital payment systems such as Apple Pay that turn their phones into a credit card. A similar process of vetting someone's digital credentials would authorize AI agents to work on a customer's behalf, in a way Forestell says must assure buyers, banks and merchants that the transactions are legitimate and that Visa will handle disputes.",
      "Forestell said that doesn't mean AI agents will take over the entire shopping experience, but it might be useful for errands that either bore some people \u2014 like groceries, home improvement items or even Christmas lists \u2014 or are too complicated, like travel bookings. In those situations, some people might want an agent that \u201cjust powers through it and automatically goes and does stuff for us,\u201d Forestell said.",
      "Other shopping experiences, such as for luxury goods, are a form of entertainment and many customers still want to immerse themselves in the choices and comparisons, Forestell said. In that case, he envisions AI agents still offering assistance but staying in the background.",
      "And what about credit card debt? The credit card balances of American consumers hit $1.21 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve of New York.",
      "Forestell says consumers will give their AI agents clear spending limits and conditions that should give them confidence that the human is still in control. At first, the AI agents are likely to come back to buyers to make sure they are OK with a specific airplane ticket. Over time, those agents might get more autonomy to \u201cgo spend up to $1,500 on any airline to get me from A to B,\" he said.",
      "Part of what is attracting some AI developers to the Visa partnership is that, with a customer's consent, an AI agent can also tap into a lot of data about past credit card purchases.",
      "\u201cVisa has the ability for a user to consent to share streams of their transaction history with us,\u201d said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer. \u201cWhen we generate a recommendation -- say you\u2019re asking, \u2018What are the best laptops?\u2019 \u2014 we would know what are other transactions you\u2019ve made and the revealed preferences from that.\u201d",
      "Perplexity's chatbot can already book hotels and make other purchases, but it's still in the early stages of AI commerce, Shevelenko says. The San Francisco startup has also, along with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, told a federal court it would consider buying Google's internet browser, Chrome, if the U.S. forces a breakup of the tech giant in a pending antitrust case.",

      "Investigators have concluded that the leak of a Wisconsin Supreme Court abortion order last year was likely deliberate, but they were unable to determine who was responsible",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Investigators concluded in a report released Wednesday that the leak of a Wisconsin Supreme Court abortion order last year was likely deliberate, but they were unable to determine who was responsible.",
      "The June leak of a draft order showed the court would take a case brought by Planned Parenthood, which is seeking to declare access to abortion a right protected by the state constitution. A week after the leak was reported, the court issued the order accepting the case.",
      "The draft order, which was not a ruling on the case itself, was obtained by online news outlet Wisconsin Watch.",
      "The Supreme Court's seven justices, in a statement released with the investigative report, called the leak \u201ca breach of trust the court had not experienced in its history.\u201d All seven justices condemned the leak.",
      "The leaked order in June came in one of two abortion-related cases before the court. The court also heard a second case challenging the 1849 abortion ban brought by Attorney General Joh Kaul. A ruling in that case is pending.",
      "The court has yet to set a date for oral arguments in the Planned Parenthood case that was the subject of the leaked memo.",
      "Investigators questioned 62 people, including all seven Supreme Court justices, staff, interns and people with access to the court during a two-week period in June from the date the draft was available until Wisconsin Watch published its article.",
      "Network logs, including individual web histories, shared folder files, individual folders, and emails from all employees with access to the draft order were also reviewed, the report said.",
      "Additionally, printer data was analyzed to see who may have printed off a copy of the draft order.",
      "\u201cAll available leads have been thoroughly pursued, and no suspects have been positively identified at this time,\u201d the report said. It added that there was no evidence that the leak was the result of a breach of the court's computer system.",
      "The report did conclude that the draft order had been forwarded to the personal email account of Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, one of the four liberal justices on the court who voted to hear the abortion case.",
      "Bradley's law clerk told investigators that forwarding important documents to Bradley's personal email account was standard operating procedure.",
      "That was the only time prior to publication of the Wisconsin Watch article that the draft order was forwarded to an email outside of the state court system, the report said.",
      "Bradley did not return an email on Wednesday asking about the report.",
      "Bradley is retiring at the end of her term in August. She is being replaced by Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, who won election to the court in April, ensuring that liberals will maintain their 4-3 majority.",
      "Missing computer data hindered the investigation, the report said. The logs showing websites visited in the two weeks leading up to the Wisconsin Watch story about the leaked order were incomplete, the report said. Only logs from June 26 and June 27 were available, not from June 13 through June 26 as requested. The article was published on June 26.",
      "The lack of those website visitation logs \u201csignificantly hampered the ability to thoroughly examine the circumstances surrounding the leak,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe issue underscores the importance of proper data management, retention, and verification procedures, especially when such information is crucial for ongoing investigations.\u201d",
      "The court hired an independent investigator to look into the leak because the court does not have an independent law enforcement agency. However, the report did not identify who led the investigation.",
      "Three retired police detectives were hired at a cost of $165,740 to conduct the investigation and write the report, a spokesperson for the state court system said.",
      "Investigations into the inner workings of the Wisconsin Supreme Court are rare and fraught.",
      "In 2011, when Bradley accused then-Justice David Prosser of choking her, the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Department led the investigation. That agency took over the investigation after the chief of Capitol Police at the time said he had a conflict. But Republicans accused the sheriff of having a conflict because he was a Democrat who endorsed Bradley.",
      "The Sauk County district attorney acted as special prosecutor in that case and declined to bring charges.",

      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",

      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",

      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",

      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",

      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",

      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.",

      "When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.",
      "The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.",
      "Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.",
      "Opportunities beyond America",
      "The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand \u2013 think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.",

      "Most homes have standard meters and will not be affected whether they have a smart meter or not. But campaigners estimate more than 300,000 homes have the old RTS meters and could lose heating - or have it stuck on constantly.",
      "The government said the industry had to \"work urgently to continue to increase the pace of replacements\".",

      "The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",
      "The figures marked the first quarterly decline in three years, and came as the introduction of import taxes by President Donald Trump has scrambled global trade and created major uncertainty.",

      "This report tracked activity through the end of March, a period before Trump announced his most far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on China and other countries around the world, which sparked a dramatic sell-off in the stock market and turmoil in currency and debt markets.",
      "It showed imports skyrocketed by more than 40% in the first three months of the year, while consumer spending grew 1.8%, down from 4% at the end of 2024.",
      "Analysts cautioned that those figures could be distorted by people pulling forward their purchases in anticipation of tariffs.",

      "Nationwide's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.",
      "April's drop in house prices was the biggest monthly fall since August 2023, according to UK economist Ashley Webb from Capital Economics.",
      "He said that the easing of mortgage rates would help boost housing demand in the coming months, offsetting any tightening in spending as a result of higher prices potentially caused by US president Donald Trump's trade tariffs.",
      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "Recent figures suggested that more low-deposit mortgages at 5% or 10% are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",
      "\"With the anticipation of further rate cuts and mortgage provider competition, we expect to see the market accelerate through the gears over the remainder of the year,\" said Jean Jameson, from estate agent Foxtons."

      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",

      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "Ten of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.",
      "Only Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.",
      "The exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.",
      "Commentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.",
      "While plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.",

      "Here I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.",
      "South America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.",
      "The US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.",
      "For example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.",
      "There is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.",
      "With the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.",
      "These include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.",
      "He tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".",
      "However, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.",
      "So his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.",
      "\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Yet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.",
      "Take the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.",
      "Japan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.",
      "Other Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.",
      "Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.",
      "Trump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.",
      "This would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.",
      "Meanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place.",
      "The other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.",
      "Uruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.",
      "He said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.",
      "You may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.",
      "Whether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.",
      "Firstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.",
      "The US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.",
      "Brazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.",
      "Argentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.",
      "\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.",
      "Trump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.",
      "Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.",
      "Looking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.",
      "After all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.",
      "Mr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"",
      "He theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.",
      "So, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.",
      "As Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"",
      "Subject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.",

      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",

      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",

      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

    "summary": "Pay review bodies recommend increases for teachers and NHS workers above the 2.8% budgeted for by government.",
    "story": [
      "The government has ruled out any extra cash for pay rises after review bodies recommended new deals for teachers and NHS staff above the amount budgeted for by ministers, Downing Street has said.",
      "The pay review body for teachers in England has recommended a pay rise of about 4% this year, while its NHS equivalent has recommended about 3%, according to figures first reported by The Times.",
      "Both figures are higher than the 2.8% the government had budgeted for in their proposals to the pay bodies, and are likely to place further strain on public finances.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government would look at the pay proposals \"and respond in due course\".",
      "Are pay review bodies completely independent?",
      "Government recommends 2.8% pay rise for public sector",
      "Last year the government accepted the recommendations of the pay review bodies in full, handing workers raises of between 4.75% to 6% - a move that ended widespread industrial action.",
      "Sir Keir has cited ending strikes as a key part of his plan to improve the NHS, arguing it is one of the reasons waiting lists have been falling for the past six months.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC: \"I think what we've proved is by working with staff, we get better results.",
      "\"As for the pay recommendations, we will look at them and we will respond in due course,\" Sir Keir added.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman later added there would be \"no additional funding\" for pay deals \"if recommended awards exceed what departments can afford\" - suggesting cuts and efficiency savings would be needed.",
      "The government could reject the pay recommendations and stick to 2.8%.",
      "But it is more likely that ministers say the higher pay will have to be funded by existing budgets and efficiency savings.",
      "That would set ministers on a collision course with trade unions and - government insiders privately concede - make a new wave of strikes possible.",
      "Teaching unions NASUWT and National Education Union, which together represent the bulk of England's teaching workforce, have already threatened strikes if pay rises trigger cuts or layoffs.",
      "National Education Union general secretary Daniel Kebede said: \"They need to ensure the pay award is above inflation, that it takes steps to address the crisis in recruitment and retention, but most of all that it is fully funded.\"",
      "The British Medical Association (BMA) has previously said the government's approach \"indicates a poor grasp of the unresolved issues from two years of industrial action\".",
      "Health Minster Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: \"We are all about putting more money into the pockets of working people, but we do also have to ensure that we are balancing the books, and we have got to work in terms of public sector pay within fiscal constraints.",
      "\"We will give these recommendations careful consideration.",
      "\"But I would, of course, also urge our colleagues in the trade union movement to engage constructively with us and recognise the reality of the financial position.\"",
      "Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson said the government will face \"tough\" trade-offs when considering how to award pay.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set \"very, very tight budgets\" so any pay increase risks the government being \"forced into tax rises or other spending cuts\", Johnson said.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Johnson said: \"If you're increasing pay then you can't do other things.",
      "\"You can't employ more teachers or open breakfast clubs or have more doctors and nurses.\"",
      "Public anger over pay, squeezed public services and potential strikes could play a major role in local elections this week - the government's first major test since last year's landslide general election victory.",
      "Sir Keir is spending Monday touring hospitals promoting reforms to the NHS app - which he said will haul the health service out of the \"dark ages\", saving it money and cutting waiting lists.",
      "The salaries of NHS staff, as well as other public-sector workers such as police officers, teachers and the members of the armed forces, are recommended by eight pay review bodies (PRBs).",
      "They cover 2.5 million workers - about 45% of public-sector staff - and a pay bill of around \u00a3100bn.",
      "The PRBs are made up of economists and experts on human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector and are appointed by the relevant government department.",
      "The independent pay review bodies take overall earnings, both public and private sector, and the forecast rate of inflation into account when they make their recommendations.",

      "The book will be published in 2026, and will be the third about the beloved animal - after 1999's best-selling original and 2004's sequel The Gruffalo's Child.",

      "That is the lowest level since the charity started gathering data in 2005.",
      "Some of those who had the original books read to them as young children will now be able to read the new story to their own kids.",

      "She said she was \"delighted\" when illustrator Axel Scheffler came back on board. \"I really hope that children - and adults too - will enjoy the new story, as I know what a wonderful experience shared reading can be,\" she added.",

      "The first two books have sold 18 million copies, Macmillan said.",
      "NLT chief executive Jonathan Douglas said \"reading and sharing stories is critical for shaping a child's early speech and language development\".",
      "Since the two main Gruffalo books were published, there have been spin-offs and animated versions of both, the first of which was nominated for an Oscar.",

      "Sir Jonathan Bate, professor of English Literature at Arizona State University told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday that the Gruffalo \"really is one of the children's classics.\"",

      "But where has the character been for all these years?",
      "Speaking on the same programme, eight-year-old Lupin said he imagined the Gruffalo had \"been traveling and exploring\" in his time away.",
      "\"The Gruffalo's child is now grown up and has kids, so the Gruffalo is a granddad,\" he speculated.",

      "\"He has had to shave off all of his fur as it is so hot and wear a disguise as he is so famous.\"",

      "A third, Ottilie, said she was \"so excited\" about the Gruffalo's return.",

    "story": [
      "Author Philip Pullman has revealed details of the sixth and final book in his series about Lyra Silvertongue, the character at the heart of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust trilogies.",
      "The Rose Field will be published on 23 October, and will follow his heroine's story up to her early 20s.",
      "She was 11 when she was introduced in the best-selling and award-winning first His Dark Materials book, Northern Lights, in 1995.",
      "Pullman, 78, said he was \"relieved\" to have \"come out of the end alive and able to see it being made into a book and published\".",
      "The Rose Field refers to a magnetic or gravitational field, and was mentioned in the opening chapters of Northern Lights, when scholars at Lyra's Oxford college secretly discussed a mysterious phenomenon called Dust.",
      "\"In this final book, Lyra is on the verge of discovering what Dust is and what it means, and the story is about how that happens,\" the author told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.",
      "The story also deals with the nature of imagination, the former Oxford English teacher said. \"I've got a view of what the imagination is, and Lyra discovers what she thinks the imagination is, so we're talking about that as well.\"",
      "The Book of Dust",
      "Beyond the world of Dust and daemons, this book has been influenced by real-life global events, including the rise of tech billionaires, Pullman revealed.",
      "\"It has become clear to me in the last 10 years that the influence of money and the power of the billionaire class, the power of the tech industry and all those extractive things like oil and gas and so on, have a much deeper effect on the world than I had thought,\" he said.",
      "\"And in thinking about that, and seeing the way the story's gone, and seeing what Lyra has to face and endure and decide about, I've thought about it more deeply myself.",
      "\"The world has changed enormously. We're either at the end of a long period of American power, which will end, presumably, like the end of any empire, in chaos, destructiveness, and then the gradual coming together of nations in a new form. That'll be interesting to watch, if I'm still alive to watch it.",
      "\"But we're also at a time when we can look back, with the resources of the internet and so on... We're at an age where we've got the wisdom of centuries and millennia to draw on. It'll be interesting to see if we do or we don't. I suspect that most of us won't, but some of us might.\"",
      "The Rose Field comes six years after the publication of the previous book in The Book of Dust series.",
      "The trilogy's first two books have sold 49 million copies around the world, publisher Midas said.",
      "Pullman said he would now turn his attention to planning a memoir, which would be titled Before I Forget.",
      "\"I've been talking for quite a while about writing a memoir before I forget everything, and that's something that's possibly on the horizon,\" he said.",
      "\"I was born in 1946 I was brought up as a child of the British Empire, which still existed then. And I've seen a very great number of changes, as everyone of my age has.",
      "\"There's nothing remarkable about that, but I've seen a lot of things that I loved, enjoyed, made me happy, made me excited in various ways. And I'd like to remember those and write them down, because I think it's a shame if they're not celebrated and remembered.\"",

    "summary": "The Irish band have a reputation for provocation, but a new row has led to rising scrutiny and anger.",
    "story": [
      "To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.",
      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",
      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",
      "Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.",
      "In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.",
      "Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah\".",
      "They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.",
      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of \"as Gaeilge\" rap acts like Iml\u00e9 and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",
      "This week, Kneecap's album entered the iTunes chart in Italy, Brazil and Germany for the first time.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:51:37 GMT",
    "summary": "As the BBC finds some pockets of bad behaviour among a small number of staff, what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Samir Shah's anger was obvious, the BBC chairman's voice shaking with fury as he delivered his message of change. \"If you think you're too big to live by the values of this organisation, you are wrong and we will find you out,\" he promised.",
      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

    "summary": "After years of suffering, a cutting-edge test diagnosed Ellie Irwin with a rare bacterial infection.",
    "story": [
      "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years.",
      "Ellie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye that didn't go away, resulting in blurred vision. No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.",
      "It was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.",
      "\"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\"",
      "Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\".",
      "\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.",
      "In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.",
      "Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.",
      "\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.",
      "\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"",
      "The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.",
      "Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.",
      "\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"",
      "It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.",
      "Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.",
      "A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.",
      "Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.",
      "For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.",
      "However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.",
      "\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"",
      "Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".",
      "In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.",
      "It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.",
      "Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.",
      "\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says.",
      "\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"",
      "A single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.",
      "Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.",
      "These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.",
      "\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.",
      "It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.",
      "Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding.",
      "Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.",
      "She says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"",

      "Councillors chose the car park over a site on Corporation Square at the People and Communities Committee last month.",
      "Green Party representative Smyth said the council was lifting between 600 and 700 needles a month in the city centre, with other organisations also involved in the collection of needles.",
      "A council report stated there had been an increase in needle finds in recent months and it had been \"highlighted as being in the top six locations\" for discarded needles.",
      "The proposed metal needle bin will be concreted to the ground and will provide a secure way of disposing of sharps.",
      "Smyth had previously tabled motions for similar bins to be placed in Writer's Square, however this is not council land.",
      "He said the Department for Communities (DfC) had turned down this call.",
      "\"They are worried about image but I would say if needles continue to be found in the area of high significance, then that's going to provide an image problem,\" he said.",

      "\"This poses a risk not only to them but also to members of the public,\" he said.",
      "\"Whilst this is a very small response, I think we need to get our heads around the bigger issue of rising drug use in and around Belfast city centre and how we tackle it.\"",
      "In March 2023, Belfast City councillors passed a motion in favour of setting up a safe injecting facility to help prevent overdoses among drug users.",
      "The council has no legal power to open a facility and a change in legislation would be required for this to happen.",
      "The aim would be to reduce overdoses and drug-related harm as well as making drug use less visible to the community.",
      "Smyth said such a facility could make the area safe for \"people who live, work and socialise in the city centre\".",
      "Damian McNairney, a volunteer and trustee from The People's Kitchen in Belfast, said the bin would help but described Belfast city centre as being in a drug crisis.",
      "The kitchen offers support to vulnerable and homeless people.",
      "\"We need to be more adventurous, we need to be more compassionate in our approach to the issue,\" said Mr McNairney.",
      "\"Addicts are being demonised, we need to look and see if we can help.",
      "\"If we solve the problem at source, i.e. the addiction, then we are going to be able to deal with the drug paraphernalia and the other issues allied to that.\"",
      "Mr McNairney said there were other areas with \"more prominent use\" but getting needles off the street was always a positive.",
      "\"There are needles around the town anyway. By not putting the bins up they're not going to go away,\" he said.",
      "Mr McNairney said he had visited a safe injection site which opened in Dublin in 2024 and he was in favour of a similar facility in Belfast.",
      "\"It seems to be very encouraging in terms of people using it, there's drug paraphernalia that has been taken off the streets, it's being safely disposed of and people with addictions are being signposted to other services,\" he said.",
      "In March, Justice Minister Naomi Long told BBC News NI that the \"war on drugs had not been won\" and there needed to be a rethink of how illegal drugs were dealt with in Northern Ireland.",
      "What are needle bins?",
      "A sharps disposal \u2013 or needle \u2013 bin is a type of container that is specially designed for the safe disposal of sharp medical waste, such as needles and syringes.",

      "The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to \"critical\" staff shortages among radiographers who specialise in this area.",
      "Sally Reed, 67, who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer, told the BBC that \"if something can save your life you should go for it\" - whether it's administered by a woman or man.",
      "Major breast cancer screening AI trial to begin",
      "Women urged to book breast screening appointments",
      "'I may not have been here today without mammogram'",
      "But Sally also admits women who already don't want to go for breast screening \"would definitely be turned off by a man\".",
      "Breast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.",
      "According to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.",
      "Among mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.",
      "It takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.",
      "Changes to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.",
      "Sue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.",
      "\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".",
      "Johnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.",
      "The prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.",
      "She says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.",
      "Ms Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.",
      "She's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.",
      "Because of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.",
      "But Claire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says \"it's vital that efforts to build up the screening workforce do not inadvertently damage uptake of breast screening\".",
      "She says that \"while we welcome every effort to reduce staff shortages and delays in breast screening, we know that concerns about being seen by a male mammographer already deter some women from attending breast screening, even with current staffing being all-female\".",
      "Ms Rowney adds that recruiting male mammographers could be an issue for some women in ethnic minority communities, who may have greater concerns around preserving their modesty and who may be less likely to take up the offer of screening."

      "The sugar tax applied to fizzy drinks could be extended to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes under new government plans.",
      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

    "summary": "Former PM Sir Tony Blair says limiting fossil fuels is \"doomed to fail\" and a new approach is needed.",
    "story": [
      "The government has defended its net-zero policies after Sir Tony Blair said limiting fossil fuels was \"doomed to fail\" and a new approach was needed.",
      "The ex-Labour prime minister argued the climate change debate had become \"irrational\" and people in rich countries no longer wanted to make financial sacrifices \"when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal\".",
      "His comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.",
      "Asked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here.\"",
      "Labour ministers have insisted the drive to net zero will not involve any financial sacrifices and have minimal impact on people's lives.",
      "Minutes before PMQs, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement saying they \"support the government's 2050 net zero targets\" and that the UK government's approach is \"the right one\".",
      "Questioned whether the institute had been asked by the government to issue a clarification to help defuse a growing political row, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I won't get into private conversations.\"",
      "Sir Keir's spokesman also stressed that the PM had confidence in Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, adding that he was \"doing a great job\".",
      "But he said the PM did not agree with Sir Tony that there was too much \"hysteria\" in the climate change debate.",
      "He told reporters: \"I don't think so, I mean I think we're taking a very practical and pragmatic approach to this here in the UK.\"",
      "He added: \"Our approach to net zero is clear. It is families up and down this country that will pay the price for the UK's dependence on fossil fuel markets.\"",
      "Nicholas Stern - who wrote an influential report on the economics of climate change for Tony Blair when he was in government in 2006 - described the report from the Tony Blair Institute as \"muddled and misleading\".",
      "He said there was \"far more progress being made around the world to decarbonise the global economy than it suggests\" and that it did not take account of the UK's leadership in the field.",
      "\"If the UK wobbles on its route to net zero, other countries may become less committed. The UK matters,\" said Prof Stern, who chairs the Grantham Research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics.",
      "The TBI report argues that the expected global rise in fossil fuel use and the doubling of airline travel over the next 20 years undermines current climate policies.",
      "\"These are the inconvenient facts, which mean that any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail,\" Sir Tony wrote in the foreward to the report.",
      "The report says existing carbon targets should be kept in place to give certainty to business but a rethink of how they are achieved was urgently needed.",
      "It says the focus should instead be on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear fusion - and new international efforts to persuade the world's biggest economies, such as China and India, to cut their emissions.",
      "To help achieve the 2050 target, Labour and the previous Conservative government made a series of pledges including \"clean\" electricity, ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and installing 600,000 electric heat pumps a year by 2028.",
      "Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "Miliband accuses net zero opponents of 'nonsense and lies'",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch recently ditched her party's support for net zero by 2050.",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins said there was \"consensus across the board\" on the need to protect the environment, but that \"we have to take the public with us\".",
      "And she said Sir Tony had sent a \"clear message\" to the government that it needs to \"rethink\" its approach to net zero.",
      "In a sign of the acrimony swilling around this debate within Labour, one government source suggested Sir Tony's comments may have been affected by the Tony Blair Institute having received funding from oil rich Saudi Arabia.",
      "The TBI says it is \"editorially independent\".",
      "The Labour Party has had a complicated relationship with Sir Tony and his legacy since he left Downing Street in 2007.",
      "Ed Miliband's election as leader in 2010 over his brother, David, was seen in part as a repudiation of Blairism, as was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to a much greater extent.",
      "But since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in 2020 he has often embraced the most electorally-successful leader in Labour's history. He has also hired some of the leading figures from Sir Tony's Downing Street.",
      "Jonathan Powell, Downing Street chief of staff under Sir Tony, is now Sir Keir's national security adviser, and Liz Lloyd, a former deputy chief of staff, is now back as director of policy delivery.",

      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "The judges said trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the \"potentially vulnerable group\".",
      "The Equalities and Human Rights Commission also published interim guidance after the ruling which said trans women \"should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\" in workplaces or public-facing services.  The same applies to trans men, who are biologically female.",

      "Dr McCloud, who stepped down from a High Court role last year, said the Supreme Court judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\".",

      "Some trans campaigners have expressed disappointment at the ruling. They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",
      "Mahmood told the committee the Supreme Court had \"handled things very sensitively\".",
      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",

      "Asked about the issue on Radio 4's Today Programme, Cooper she had \"concerns about some of the individual cases\" where the government \"disagreed\" with decisions made in the courts.",
      "\"Respect for family life is supposed to be balanced against other issues, including against the public interest, including against the ability for a government to set its own policies, for Parliament to set policies, and for respect for border security and control,\" she added.",
      "It is not clear how many cases the change could affect.",
      "The planned crackdown would apply to those committing an offence that places them on the sex offenders register in the UK.",

      "Ezedi killed himself within hours after he was suspected of dousing his ex-girlfriend with a corrosive liquid when he attacked her and her children in south London in January last year.",
      "He was already on the sex offenders register, after pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault and exposure in 2018, when he was granted asylum in 2020 following two failed attempts.",

      "\"The Conservatives had already tabled tough, clear reforms to remove all foreign criminals and to disapply the Human Rights Act so activists and lawyers cannot block deportations.",

      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

      "An independent report has concluded burying electricity cables underground or out at sea is far more expensive than using overhead lines.",
      "The study by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) comes as National Grid prepares to submit a planning application for more than 100 miles (160km) of new pylons between Norwich and Tilbury in Essex.",
      "Energy minster Michael Shanks said the report proved that \"pylons are the best option for taxpayers\".",

      "This report has been long-awaited and the government is hoping it will lay to rest the argument over how best to carry power from the new offshore windfarms in the North Sea.",
      "The IET concluded underground cables were, on average, around four-and-a-half times more expensive than overhead lines while cabling out at sea could be up to 11 times more expensive.",
      "It estimated a typical nine-mile (15km) long 5,000 MW overhead line would cost nearly \u00a340m to build  with the equivalent underground cable costing around \u00a3330m and as much as \u00a3820m if a new tunnel was needed.",

      "But the government has seized on the cost aspects of the newly published report.",
      "Shanks said: \"It shows that pylons are the best option for billpayers - as cables underground cost significantly more to install and maintain.\"",
      "Acknowledging the pain this could cause for those living along the route, he added \"we want to ensure those hosting this infrastructure benefit, including by offering households near new pylons \u00a32,500 off their energy bills over 10 years.\"",

      "Rosie Pearson, from the Essex Suffolk Norfolk Pylons action group, said the report was \"half-baked\".",

      "Robbie Moore, a Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, accused Bradford Councils of avoiding commissioning a new inquiry for \"fear of unearthing a very significant problem\".",

      "Interest around the subject was re-ignited at the start of the year when tech billionaire Elon Musk began calling for a second national inquiry into the scandal - a proposal that was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour ones.",
      "In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stopped short of holding such an inquiry but instead announced the audit of the current scale and nature of gang based exploitation.",
      "She also said \u00a35m would be available for \"victim-centred locally-led inquiries\" in Oldham and four other areas, which have not yet been named.",
      "She added that Tom Crowther KC, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help the government develop a new framework for the five local investigations that could be used as a model in other areas.",
      "However, last month Crowther expressed uncertainty about his role and told a committee of MPs that he had asked the Home Office \"do you still want me?\"",
      "On Monday, Phillips said the government was \"moving ahead\" with its commitment for the five inquiries and would focus on \"delivering meaningful, tangible change\".",
      "Karen Bradley, Conservative MP and chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, asked when the government would announce the locations for the local inquiries and how the minister would \"ensure that councils that are reluctant to be part of this are compelled to do so\".",
      "Phillips replied: \"Whilst we have committed to five, I expect to actually go further.\"",
      "She said the framework for inquiries would be released later in May, when Baroness Casey's review would also be published.",
      "The minister added: \"I'm going to go on the basis of facts, and I'm going to follow them wherever they tell me. Wherever they tell me there are victims that need help, that is where I will go.\""

      "The government has ruled out any extra cash for pay rises after review bodies recommended new deals for teachers and NHS staff above the amount budgeted for by ministers, Downing Street has said.",
      "The pay review body for teachers in England has recommended a pay rise of about 4% this year, while its NHS equivalent has recommended about 3%, according to figures first reported by The Times.",
      "Both figures are higher than the 2.8% the government had budgeted for in their proposals to the pay bodies, and are likely to place further strain on public finances.",

      "The government could reject the pay recommendations and stick to 2.8%.",
      "But it is more likely that ministers say the higher pay will have to be funded by existing budgets and efficiency savings.",
      "That would set ministers on a collision course with trade unions and - government insiders privately concede - make a new wave of strikes possible.",

      "National Education Union general secretary Daniel Kebede said: \"They need to ensure the pay award is above inflation, that it takes steps to address the crisis in recruitment and retention, but most of all that it is fully funded.\"",
      "The British Medical Association (BMA) has previously said the government's approach \"indicates a poor grasp of the unresolved issues from two years of industrial action\".",
      "Health Minster Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: \"We are all about putting more money into the pockets of working people, but we do also have to ensure that we are balancing the books, and we have got to work in terms of public sector pay within fiscal constraints.",
      "\"We will give these recommendations careful consideration.",
      "\"But I would, of course, also urge our colleagues in the trade union movement to engage constructively with us and recognise the reality of the financial position.\"",
      "Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson said the government will face \"tough\" trade-offs when considering how to award pay.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set \"very, very tight budgets\" so any pay increase risks the government being \"forced into tax rises or other spending cuts\", Johnson said.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Johnson said: \"If you're increasing pay then you can't do other things.",
      "\"You can't employ more teachers or open breakfast clubs or have more doctors and nurses.\"",
      "Public anger over pay, squeezed public services and potential strikes could play a major role in local elections this week - the government's first major test since last year's landslide general election victory.",
      "Sir Keir is spending Monday touring hospitals promoting reforms to the NHS app - which he said will haul the health service out of the \"dark ages\", saving it money and cutting waiting lists.",
      "The salaries of NHS staff, as well as other public-sector workers such as police officers, teachers and the members of the armed forces, are recommended by eight pay review bodies (PRBs).",
      "They cover 2.5 million workers - about 45% of public-sector staff - and a pay bill of around \u00a3100bn.",

      "In all, 315 quango chief executives received a higher salary, according to the TPA, with the top three being Channel 4's on \u00a3619,000, the chief executive of HS2 on \u00a3618,195, and head of Network Rail on \u00a3588,000.",
      "The research also found that at least 1,472 quango staff received more than \u00a3100,000 in total remuneration, which included salary, expenses and pension benefits.",

      "He said: \"Taxpayers will be shocked to hear that there are hundreds of quangocrats heading up bodies they may never have heard taking home massive pay packets the average Brit can only dream of.",
      "\"But beyond the healthy remuneration, arguably the bigger problem is that in many areas of government policy these quango bosses reign supreme, with minimal ministerial or parliamentary oversight despite the often highly sensitive and significant nature of what their organisation is responsible for.",
      "\"The government may have signalled an intent to get a grip of the quango state, but as well as restoring political accountability there needs to be serious review of some of the functions they perform.\"",
      "However, Matthew Gill, the Institute for Government's programme director on public bodies, said focusing on the pay of quango bosses could be misleading.",
      "\"It is important that public bodies are democratically accountable, but ministers cannot micro-manage everything in the public sector,\" he said.",

      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with \u00a3353.3bn budgeted for them in 2022/23, according to the latest published figures.",
      "The last major shake-up was under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, when a \"bonfire of the quangos\" scrapped nearly a third of them, including the Audit Commission and the UK Film Council.",

    "story": [
      "Planned changes to school uniform policy will affect over four million pupils across England, according to new estimates from the Department for Education (DfE).",
      "The government says seven in 10 secondary schools and 35% of primary schools in England will have to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students.",
      "The new rule is part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming a law.",
      "The government says families will save money, but school wear manufacturers warn the plans could end up costing them more.",
      "The average cost of a full school uniform and PE kit for a child at secondary school is \u00a3442, and is \u00a3343 for a primary school pupil, according to the latest DfE data.",

      "The current government wants to go further, by limiting the number of items unique to a school that have to be bought from designated suppliers.",
      "The government claims parents will save around \u00a350 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.",
      "But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items.",
      "They say branded uniforms also play a role in reducing inequality in schools and improving behaviour.",
      "Many parents rely on uniform exchanges to afford the full list of items required by their children's schools.",
      "At Darlington Borough Council's exchange, located on the ground floor of a multi-storey car park, all the uniforms have been donated and are free to local parents, who are able to stock up on branded items from over 25 schools in the area.",
      "The exchange has been running for five years and has given out approximately 12,000 items to 4,000 customers.",
      "Volunteer Kay says she is worried some school uniform policies will still be too strict even after the government's planned limit on logos comes into force.",
      "\"Some of the schools are particular about a certain skirt, a certain style from a certain supplier - so that can cause problems and be quite expensive for parents,\" she says.",
      "But she says it is a good thing that more parents will be able to buy more of their uniforms from other retailers, like supermarkets.",
      "In Darlington town centre, one mum with two sons at primary school and a daughter in secondary said she was worried about the jump in uniform costs coming when her sons join secondary school.",
      "\"It's just a nightmare,\" she said.",
      "\"My daughter's school is really strict on the uniform. You can't get black trousers, it's got to be grey, or pleated skirts. For their shoes alone I'm looking at \u00a360 a year, and there's three of them. That's not including blazers, PE kits or anything else.",
      "\"It's a lot of money when it all adds up.\"",
      "Matt Perry, head teacher at The Halifax Academy in West Yorkshire, says he makes sure pupils follow the school's rules on uniform, but also wants to ensure it is affordable for parents.",
      "The school gives its pupils ties for free, and parts of the PE kit and a school blazer are the only compulsory items with branding on.",
      "The school may cut back further if limits to branded items are brought in.",
      "The school is in an area of Halifax with high deprivation, and has a uniform bank as well as a laundrette to wash pupils' uniforms.",
      "Mr Perry says branded school uniform can bring a sense of pride and inclusion, but that tough uniform policies can be a barrier to attendance.",
      "\"There are so many different factors that children have to face in order to have clean and correct uniform that is used daily,\" he says.",
      "\"As long as we see the families really trying to adhere to the uniform policy that we've got, we can be flexible with how we interpret that. So if it is in the right colours but it's not branded, that doesn't matter to us.\"",

    "story": [
      "Interim guidance on single-sex spaces is \"ill-considered and impractical\" and should be withdrawn, the Green Party has said.",
      "The guidance, issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), followed the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.",
      "In places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use women's facilities but they should not be left with no facilities to use, the guidance says.",
      "Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer told the BBC the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination, while Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said there were questions over how it would be enforced.",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the \"logical consequence\" of the Supreme Court ruling and EHRC guidance was that \"people use the facilities of their biological sex\".",
      "Asked if the government would ban trans people from using changing rooms or toilets they wish to use in its own buildings, he told the BBC: \"In reality, when you say ban, am I going to be standing outside toilets?  I'm probably not.",
      "\"There isn't going to be toilet police but that is the logical consequence of the court ruling and the EHRC guidance.\"",
      "The UK government has welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, saying it brings \"clarity\" for women and service providers.",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements.\"",
      "Last week the Supreme Court found the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "As part of the judgement in the case brought against Scottish ministers by the group For Women Scotland, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",

      "Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said the interim guidance, which was published on Friday following the Supreme Court ruling on 15 April, was \"rushed and ill-thought out\".",
      "\"It's been really obvious that they have not listened to trans people,\" she told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.",
      "She added that the guidance put trans people at risk of discrimination, especially in workplaces, and \"seems to fly in face of the strong tradition of tolerance we have in Britain\".",
      "The Green Party said in a statement that the guidance was likely to cause \"distress\" to the trans community as well as \"further confusion to employers, businesses and service providers\" .",
      "It is calling for the guidance to be withdrawn \"until the EHRC can produce something more thought-through which takes into account the voices of all those affected\".",
      "Denyer questioned what should happen if trans people are not allowed to go to the toilet of their gender or their birth sex.",
      "The guidance also states that in some circumstances the law allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use women's facilities.",
      "When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service.",
      "However, the guidance says where possible mixed-sex toilets or changing facilities should be provided, with lockable rooms intended to be used by one person at a time, in addition to single-sex facilities.",
      "Denyer also raised concerns that for lesbian associations or venues which wanted to include trans women, the advice appeared to say they would not be allowed to.",
      "The guidance states that \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men)\", while \"a men-only or gay men-only associations should not admit trans men (biological women)\".",
      "Sir Ed also told the programme lots of people were confused and anxious about the guidance, for example over which toilet a trans man (biological woman) should use.",
      "The Lib Dem leader said his party accepted the Supreme Court ruling but there needed to be more debate in Parliament to reach a clear solution that \"respects people's rights\".",
      "The EHRC, which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses, is expected to launch a two-week consultation to seek views from those affected in May.",
      "The watchdog is then aiming to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June.",
      "A spokesperson for the EHRC said: \"The law is as set out in the Supreme Court's very readable judgment and is effective immediately.",
      "\"Employers, service providers and others with duties under the Equality Act must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary.",
      "\"But we know many people have questions about the consequences of the judgment and what it means for them, which is why we issued this [guidance] in the interim.\"",
      "The spokesperson added: \"We remain committed to promoting equality and tackling discrimination in all its forms.\"",

      "Tax rises in October's Budget are \"crippling\" her salon business, she said, and the extra \u00a323,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin.",
      "\"I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,\" she said.",
      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",

      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from \u00a37,576 to \u00a318,482 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",

      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",

      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",

      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

    "story": [
      "The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests.",
      "More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012.",
      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",
      "The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year.",
      "In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total.",
      "A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km.",
      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",
      "\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.",

      "Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is \"doomed to fail\".",
      "In a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal\".",
      "He does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.",
      "The Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the \"mad dash\" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.",
      "In its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.",
      "At the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.",
      "Writing in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"",
      "He says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".",
      "He also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".",
      "The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.",
      "It also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".",
      "Lindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"",
      "Ms Fursman said the report was \"pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise\".",
      "Downing Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.",
      "\"We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.",
      "\"Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.\"",
      "The government claims its net zero strategy is already delivering results, with \u00a343bn of private investment since last July and that its climate policies \"now support around 600,000 jobs across the UK\".",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "Miliband accuses net zero opponents of 'nonsense and lies'",
      "Net zero by 2050 'impossible' for UK, says Badenoch",
      "Labour sources are also pushing back against claims Sir Keir Starmer is going cold on the net zero agenda, pointing to a speech he made last week in which he said the clean energy mission was \"in the DNA of my government\".",
      "Reacting in the Commons to Sir Tony's comments in the report, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he agreed \"with a lot of what it says\" particularly on carbon capture and storage and AI \"which the government are doing\".",
      "But Labour's opponents were quick to seize on the former prime minister's words.",
      "Writing on social media, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Even Tony Blair now says the push for Net Zero has become 'irrational' and 'hysterical'. We are winning the argument!\"",
      "Conservative acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie said the government needed to \"urgently  change course\".",
      "\"It seems even Tony Blair has come to the realisation that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's mad dash to net zero by 2050 is simply not feasible, or sustainable,\" he added.",
      "Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \"Blair is wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The British public understands the need for decisive climate action and expects politicians to lead in delivering this action.\"",
      "Sir Tony's intervention has also been met with dismay by Labour-supporting environmental groups.",
      "One campaigner told the BBC: \"This is an oddly public and oddly-timed intervention that would usually be made by someone struggling for access.",
      "\"The Labour government are getting on with many of the policies outlined in the report because they know this is popular with people, especially the voting coalition they need to maintain for the next election.",
      "\"But adopting the anti-net-zero framing of [Tory leader Kemi] Badenoch and Reform is out of step with where the public are on this issue and will not help Labour.\"",
      "A Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: \"There is no doubt that the last Conservative government set us back by failing to invest in cheap, clean energy and home insulation.",
      "\"But that makes it all the more important that we act with urgency now, to bring down energy bills and emissions, free ourselves from reliance on Putin's gas, and restore the UK's role as a world-leader in the clean technology of the future and the jobs that go with it.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:27:52 GMT",
    "summary": "The new satellite will be able to see through clouds and forest canopies.",
    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "Their first priority is likely to be find out where the hackers are in the IT system and kick them out.",

      "They might also have taken these offline to stop the hackers from spreading their malicious software into those previously unaffected areas.",
      "It might also be the case that the company is taking all non-business critical services offline to help deal with the hack.",

      "He told the BBC that while M&S taking steps like pausing services may make the incident seem \"even more serious from the outside,\" they would allow staff to contain any potential threats and begin recovery safely.",
      "Reputational risk",
      "About a third of M&S's clothing and household goods' sales in the UK are through its online platforms and were worth some \u00a31.268bn in latest published financial results.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said even though M&S's physical stores were still open, many of them \"simply don't stock the popular ranges from online\".",
      "She added clothes sales were \"likely to take a big hit\" as the cyber-attack had occurred during a spell of warm weather when summer ranges would be \"piling up in virtual baskets\".",
      "Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said M&S's success was \"built on trust\" - and this was something customers may question after it suspended online orders.",
      "\"The longer it takes to draw a line under the cyber incident, the greater the risk to Marks & Spencer's reputation,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Shoppers want to know that their personal and financial details are safe when buying goods online and Marks & Spencer failing to give the all-clear implies that something is very wrong at its end.\"",

    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia than is usually the case from the Trump administration.",
      "The agreement refers to \"Russia's full-scale invasion\" and the US Treasury Department adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".",
      "This will hearten Kyiv, which has demanded more pressure be placed on Russia in talks between Moscow and Washington discussing a possible ceasefire.",
      "Oil and gas included alongside minerals",
      "Despite the fact that much of the talk around the deal relates to Ukraine's mineral wealth, the agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons.",
      "In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.",

      "Ukraine has long aspired to join the European Union and accession talks formally began last June.",

      "But the deal's text says that the US acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU and the need for this agreement not to conflict with that.",
      "It also says that if Ukraine needs to revisit the terms of the deal because of \"additional obligations\" as part of joining the EU, then the US agrees to negotiate in good faith.",

      "This could be potentially significant if there is no financial benefit for the US for 10 years.",
      "However, this provision does not appear to be in the agreement signed in Washington, although it might later be part of an additional \"technical\" deal.  Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that \"these terms will be subject to further discussion\".",
      "After that initial 10-year period, Kyiv says profits may be distributed between the partners.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News late on Wednesday that the deal was a signal to the American people that \"we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those and be partners with the success of the Ukraine people\".",

    "story": [
      "Israel's war in Gaza grinds on, but opposition is growing.",
      "In recent weeks, thousands of Israeli reservists \u2013 from all branches of the military \u2013 have signed letters demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government stop the fighting and concentrate instead on reaching a deal to bring back the remaining 59 hostages being held by Hamas.",
      "Eighteen months ago, few Israelis doubted the war's logic: to defeat Hamas and return the hostages.",
      "For many, the January ceasefire and subsequent return of more than 30 hostages raised hopes that the war might soon end.",
      "But after Israel broke the ceasefire and returned to war in mid-March, those hopes were dashed.",
      "\"We came to the conclusion that Israel is going to a very bad place,\" Danny Yatom, a former head of the spy agency Mossad told me.",
      "\"We understand that what mainly bothers Netanyahu is his own interests. And in the list of priorities, his interests and the interests of having the government stable are the first ones, and not the hostages.\"",
      "Many of those signing recent letters are, like Yatom, long time critics of the prime minister. Some were involved in the anti-government protests that preceded the outbreak of war on 7 October 2023 following Hamas's attack on Israel.",
      "But Yatom says that's not why he decided to speak out.",
      "\"I signed my name and I am participating in the demonstrations not because of any political reason, but because of a national reason,\" he said.",
      "\"I am highly concerned that my country is going to lose its way.\"",
      "The first open letter to be published, in early April, was signed by 1,000 air force reservists and retirees.",
      "\"The continuation of the war does not contribute to any of its declared goals,\" they wrote, \"and will lead to the death of the hostages\".",
      "The signatories urged Israelis to follow their lead before time ran out on the estimated 24 hostages still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "\"Every day that passes is further risking their lives. Every moment of hesitation is a crying shame.\"",
      "In the weeks since, similar letters have appeared from almost every branch of the military, including elite fighting and intelligence units, along with a number of decorated commanders.",
      "More than 12,000 signatures all.",
      "After 7 October, hundreds of thousands of Israeli reservists answered the call, eager to serve.",

      "As an Israeli hostage turns 48, his wife waits for blue ticks on her messages",

      "For a military that depends heavily on reservists to fight its wars, it's a looming crisis on a scale not seen since Israel's first Lebanon war in 1982.",
      "In a leafy Jerusalem park, I met \"Yoav\" (not his real name), an infantry reservist who asked not to be identified.",
      "Yoav served in Gaza last summer but said he wouldn't do it again.",
      "\"I had the feeling that I needed to go to help my brothers and sisters,\" he told me.",
      "\"I believed I was doing something good. Complicated but good. But now, I don't see it in the same way anymore.\"",
      "The government's determination to keep fighting Hamas, while hostages risk death in the tunnels of Gaza, Yoav said, was misplaced.",
      "\"We are very strong and we can beat Hamas, but it's not about beating Hamas,\" he said. \"It's about losing our country.\"",
      "During his time in Gaza, Yoav told me, he tried to be \"the best moral soldier that a man can be\".",
      "But the longer the war goes on, critics say, the harder it is for Israel to claim, as government officials often do, that its military is the most moral army in the world.",
      "In a recent column in the left of centre newspaper Haaretz, the retired general Amiram Levin said it was time for soldiers \u2013 starting with senior commanders - to think about disobeying orders.",

      "Netanyahu has lashed out at the protesters, dismissing their concerns as \"propaganda lies\", spread by \"a small handful of fringe elements \u2013 loud, anarchist and disconnected pensioners, most of whom haven't served in years\".",
      "But polls suggest the protest letters reflect a growing public conviction: that the release of the remaining hostages should come before everything.",
      "In Tel Aviv, where noisy anti-war demonstrations have been held for well over a year, images of the hostages are held aloft, while other protestors sit on the road, cradling pictures of Palestinian children killed during the war.",
      "Amid the row generated by the letters, such emotive displays appear to have rattled the authorities.",
      "On 20 April, the police briefly told protesters that \"pictures of children or babies from Gaza\" would not be permitted, along with posters displaying the words \"genocide\" or \"ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Following expressions of outrage from the organisers, the police quickly backed down.",
      "Meanwhile, the prime minister continues to speak of his determination to defeat Hamas.",
      "Military pressure, Netanyahu continues to insist, is the only way to bring the hostages home."

    "story": [
      "The estranged husband of a woman who served a poisonous mushroom lunch to her family says it was \"very rare\" for her to hold social gatherings at home.",
      "Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal meal prepared by Erin Patterson - but decided not to attend the day before.",
      "Mr Patterson is the first witness in the trial of Ms Patterson - who is charged with the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of another, with the case centring on a beef wellington lunch at her house in July 2023.",
      "Ms Patterson, 50,  has pleaded not guilty and her defence team says she \"panicked\" after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved.",
      "Three people died in hospital in the days after the meal, including Ms Patterson's former in-laws, Don Patterson, 70, and Gail Patterson, 70, as well as Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66. Local pastor Ian Wilkinson survived after weeks of treatment in hospital.",
      "The jury has been shown text messages exchanged between Simon and Erin Patterson the day before the deadly mushroom lunch.",
      "Mr Patterson said in court Thursday he felt \"too uncomfortable\" about attending the lunch.",
      "Erin Patterson responded: \"That's really disappointing. I've spent many hours this week preparing lunch for tomorrow... It's important to me that you're all there tomorrow and that I can have the conversations that I need to have.\"",
      "The prosecution alleges Ms Patterson invited the group to lunch \"on the pretence she'd been diagnosed with cancer\".",
      "The court in Morwell, regional Victoria, heard that between the couple's marriage in 2007 and separation in 2015, there were a number of periods of separation and reconciliation - including Erin Patterson leaving her husband and their baby son in the middle of a road trip across Australia in 2009.",
      "Mr Patterson had to drive from Townsville to Perth - a distance of about 5,000 km (3,100 miles) - alone with the child, he told the court.",
      "The couple met in 2002, while both working at Monash City Council, where Mr Patterson was a civil engineer.",
      "Asked about his wife, Mr Patterson said: \"Erin is very intelligent.",
      "\"Some of the things that attracted me to her in the first place is definitely her intelligence. She's quite witty and can be quite funny.\"",
      "Asked about how his wife got on with his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, Mr Patterson said: \"She especially got on with dad. They shared a love of knowledge and learning in the world.\"",
      "With his voice faltering, Mr Patterson added: \"I think she loved his gentle nature.\"",
      "He said Ms Patterson held a university degree in business and accounting, and was also qualified as an air traffic controller having worked at Melbourne's Tullemarine airport.",
      "Mr Patterson is due in court again on Friday to take more questions from prosecutors.",
      "'Chatty' relationship unravelled",
      "Mr Patterson painted a picture of a relationship peppered with periods of separation - the first within the first two years of marriage - at one point becoming emotional and asking for tissues.",
      "After the final separation there was a lot of communication by text message he said, including \"banter\" and talk about politics, he said.",
      "But there was a change in the relationship in 2022 when Ms Patterson was \"upset\" when her husband listed himself as separated on his tax return.",
      "The \"chatty nature\" of their relationship \"pretty much stopped\" after this, Mr Patterson said - with communication now only about the \"practical management\" of their family life.",
      "Wearing a navy suit, white shirt and purple tie, he told the court that Ms Patterson received a \"substantial inheritance\" from her grandmother which Mr Patterson estimated at A$2m ($1.3m; \u00a3964,000) - though it was not paid in a lump sum and was \"dribbled out\" by the executors of the estate.",
      "The jury has heard that there is no dispute that the lunch of beef wellington, mashed potatoes and green beans contained death cap mushrooms and caused the guests' illnesses.",
      "Whether Ms Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury is the main issue in the case, the judge has told the jury.",
      "The court heard the couple had married in 2007 and had two children together - though separated permanently in 2015 .",
      "They had remained \"amicable\" including sharing family holidays, though there was a falling out over child support payments in 2022, the jury was told.",
      "During the prosecution's opening statement on Wednesday, lead barrister Nanette Rogers said the jury would hear evidence that Ms Patterson had travelled to a location, near her home in Leongatha, where death cap mushroom sightings had been logged on a naturalist website.",
      "And in the days after the lunch, she took a number of steps to \"conceal\" what she had done, the prosecution alleged.",
      "There'd be evidence that she lied to investigators about the source of the mushrooms in the dish - saying some had come from an Asian grocery in Melbourne and she had never foraged wild ones. And she made a trip to a local dump to dispose of a food dehydrator prosecutors say she used to prepare the toxic meal.",
      "Ms Patterson's barrister has said she did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests.",
      "\"The defence case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food she had served them.\"",
      "'Erin served herself her food on a coloured plate'",
      "The court heard how Mr Patterson spoke to his father the morning after the lunch and discovered both his parents had been up since midnight with vomiting and diahorrea and that they had called an ambulance.",
      "And after trying to call his aunt and uncle, Heather and Ian Wilkinson, he went to their home when they did not answer.",
      "\"Ian answered the door. He looked grey and spooked,\" Mr Patterson recalled. \"Yeah, he was struggling.",
      "\"I said 'How are you?' He said 'Not good'.\"",
      "Mr Patterson then saw Heather Wilkinson sitting on the couch, he told the court.",
      "\"She looked pretty crook. She had a container as a spew bucket, \" he said.",
      "After Mr Wilkinson left the room, Heather spoke to him, he confirmed, under questioning from prosecutor Dr Rogers.",
      "\"We didn't have much conversation, but she was puzzled and she said 'I noticed Erin served herself her food on a coloured plate which was different to the rest'.\"",
      "\"I acknowledged I'd heard her, but did not progress it as a conversation,\" he added.",
      "Because he had been told an ambulance would have taken an hour to arrive, Mr Patterson drove the couple to hospital in the Wilkinsons' car when Heather Wilkinson raised the subject once more.",
      "\"She mentioned the coloured plate again, She asked me 'Is Erin short of crockery? Is that why she would have this different coloured plate that she served herself with?\" Mr Patterson said.",
      "\"I can't remember the exact phrase but it was something like that.",
      "And what did you reply, the prosecutor asked?",
      "\"I said yes, Erin doesn't have that many plates and that may be the reason.\"",
      "Mr Patterson became emotional again, describing going to see his parents at Korumburra hospital where they were in the same room but separate beds.",
      "\"Dad was substantially worse than mum. He was really struggling,\" he said fighting back tears..",
      "\"He was lying on his side. He was hunched quite noticeably, with a really discoloured face, struggling to speak.",
      "\"Speaking was an effort, taking the energy to speak was an effort and his voice was strained in a way that he wasn't right inside. He was in pain.\"",

      "Writing two weeks after the much-derided Blue Origin voyage, which saw her take an 11-minute flight with five other women, the US star said the \"online world\" had tried to make her a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\".",
      "Her comments came after fans paid for a billboard in New York to show their support for her ahead of her world tour.",

      "\"Please know I am OK, I have done a lot [of] work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me.\"",
      "She said she is \"not perfect\", but rather on a \"human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall\".",
      "\"But I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level unlocks.\"",
      "She added: \"When the 'online' world tries to make me a human Pi\u00f1ata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.\"",

      "He gave up teaching to dedicate himself to the trees when he returned home six years ago and was shocked to find the Mount Kei Central Forest Reserve, once lush with wild shea trees, had been turned into a near-barren expanse dotted with stumps.",
      "Now nicknamed \"Bwana Shea\" or Mr Shea, he walks from village to village in the north-west of the country rallying people to protect what he sees as a vanishing treasure.",
      "Local people, he said, had lost interest in the trees and began chopping them down as farmers were experiencing failed harvests.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, the shea nut tree had a pattern of its production. It flowered in December then by the time it reached April, it would be ready,\" Mr Gerima told the BBC.",
      "\"But now because of climate change there is this prolonged drought. Hence it affects the production of shea nuts.\"",

      "\"We would get good money to take our children to school and take care of our families. But now my business is collapsing, it is a huge setback,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I used to sell up to five jerry cans of shea oil a week, right now I can only fill two jerry cans at most.\"",

      "Professor John Bosco Okullo, a leading agroforestry expert from Uganda's Makerere University who has been studying shea nut trees for more than two decades, also blames years of widespread insecurity for the problems.",
      "\"In the 1990s, communities used to own and protect the shea trees,\" the academic, who is part of a European Union project aiming to conserve and utilise the tree, told the BBC.",
      "This was before much of the north of the country was ravaged by a rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, whose fighters were notorious for abducting children - forcing the boys to become fighters and keeping the girls as sex slaves.",
      "The rebels have largely been wiped out, but nearly 20 years of conflict drove people to leave their villages and find safety in camps.",
      "Other communities were affected by dangerous cattle raids - also leading to the displacement of thousands of people in the early 2000s.",
      "\"After cattle raiding and civil unrest by the Lord's Resistance Army displaced people, the sense of ownership was lost,\" said Prof Okullo",

      "Prof Okullo agrees with Mr Gerima that climate change has further exacerbated the situation.",
      "\"The productivity has gone down. The trees are not flowering and fruiting the way they used to. Rain fluctuation has disrupted the shea tree's natural cycles,\" he said.",
      "Rapid urban expansion is another threat.",
      "\"Most of these places which used to have shea trees now have new districts, new hospitals, schools,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"You find the shea trees are being cut for development. We need affirmative planting. Otherwise, if we are waiting for natural regeneration, it is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Despite what seems like a gloomy outlook, Prof Okullo takes heart from campaigners such as Mr Gerima.",

      "Washington and Kyiv have signed a long-awaited deal involving Ukraine's natural resources, after months of contentious negotiations.",
      "Details are still emerging about the agreement, but both sides have confirmed that it sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split.",
      "In a statement, the US said the agreement \"signals to Russia\" that the Trump administration is \"committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous\" Ukraine.",
      "It comes just over two months after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Zelensky at the White House turned into a public shouting match sparking fear that the US might withdraw its support for Ukraine.",

      "Seven key takeaways from the US-Ukraine agreement",
      "What we know about the deal",
      "Ukraine's Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko flew to Washington on Wednesday after an apparent breakthrough in negotiations to sign the deal with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "After joining Bessent at a signing ceremony, Svyrydenko listed its provisions on social media.",
      "Posting on X, she said the deal establishes a reconstruction investment fund to help attract Western investment in Ukrainian projects in minerals, oil and gas.",
      "She says the resources will remain the property of Ukraine, and Kyiv will choose where to do the extracting.",
      "The partnership will be equal, on a 50/50 basis, she says, adding that the agreement includes no debt obligation to the US.",
      "The US will play a role in helping to attract investment and technology to the projects in Ukraine.",
      "As part of the deal, the US will contribute new assistance to Kyiv, which may include, for example, air defence systems.",
      "She says the fund's income and contributions will not be taxed by either country.",
      "Svyrydenko says the deal must still be ratified by Ukrainian lawmakers.",
      "The agreement recognises the contributions that Ukraine has made to global security, she writes, thanking everyone who worked on brokering it.",
      "It is unclear if the deal includes an explicit security guarantee from the US, something Zelensky has pushed hard for throughout negotiations.",
      "A US Treasury Department statement said: \"No state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.\"",
      "Trump, for his part, said the deal represents payback for the money the US has spent on the war so far.",
      "\"Biden handed them $350bn,\" Trump said in a phone call in to a town hall on the NewsNation network. He went on to add: \"We made a deal where we get much more in theory than the $350bn.\"",

      "BBC Verify: How much has the US given to Ukraine?",
      "Trump has made the claim that the US has spent around $350 billion (\u00a3263 billion) on Ukraine aid on numerous occasions. But a BBC Verify analysis found the actual amount is much lower.",
      "Asked if the US's presence in Ukraine might inhibit Russia's movement in the region, he said \"it could\".",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.",
      "This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.",
      "Also, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Svyrydenko, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "There are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines.",
      "A quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.",
      "Another issue is it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.",

      "Putin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".",
      "\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.",

    "summary": "The real battleground of the current trade war might be China's domestic economy",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Syrians have more freedom after Assad, but could they soon lose it?",

      "Published30 April 2025",
      "Romanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.",
      "Far-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.",
      "Georgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".",
      "The leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.",
      "He is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.",
      "At the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.",
      "Protesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections.",
      "What happened on TikTok?",
      "Pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.",
      "Georgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%.",
      "He declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning.",
      "Instead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.",
      "An independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".",
      "Authorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.",
      "The authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".",
      "Separately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.",
      "But authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians.",
      "The Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.",
      "Calin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election",
      "Influencer campaign",
      "Shortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\".",
      "They did not name a specific candidate.",
      "They had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it.",
      "FameUp declined to comment to the BBC.",
      "Cristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".",
      "Some influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.",
      "While the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"",
      "The comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".",
      "It is still not clear who created these bot accounts.",
      "Experts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".",
      "\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.",
      "The uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January.",
      "The Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections.",
      "In response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.",
      "Romeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents",
      "'TikTok King'",
      "Then, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.",
      "The prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts.",
      "His lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".",
      "We spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts.",
      "He says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.",
      "Elgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.",
      "Elgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"",
      "Much is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.",
      "It's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.",
      "\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"",

      "Sergele is now in danger of being dragged into what's known locally as the \"Forbidden Zone\" - a large strip of land in northern Iraq affected by Turkey's war with the Kurdish militant group the PKK, which launched an insurgency in southern Turkey in 1984.",
      "The Forbidden Zone spans almost the entire length of the Iraqi border with Turkey and is up to 40km (25 miles) deep in places.",
      "Community Peacemaker Teams, a human rights group based in Iraqi Kurdistan, says that hundreds of civilians have been killed by drone and air strikes in and around the Forbidden Zone. According to a 2020 Kurdistan parliamentary report, thousands have been forced off their land and whole villages have been emptied out by the conflict.",
      "Sergele is now effectively on the front line of Turkey's war with the PKK.",
      "When the BBC World Service Eye Investigations team visited the area, Turkish aircraft pummelled the mountains surrounding the village to root out PKK militants, who have long operated from caves and tunnels in northern Iraq.",
      "Much of the land around Sergele had been burned by shelling.",
      "\"The more bases they put up, the worse it gets for us,\" says Sherwan.",
      "Turkey has been rapidly growing its military presence in the Forbidden Zone in recent years, but until now the scale of this expansion was not publicly known.",
      "Using satellite imagery assessed by experts and corroborated with on-the-ground reporting and open-source content, the BBC found that as of December 2024, the Turkish military had built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq.",
      "Through its vast network of military bases, Turkey now holds de-facto control of more than 2,000 sq km (772 square miles) of Iraqi land, the BBC's analysis found.",
      "Satellite images further reveal that the Turkish military has built at least 660km (410 miles) of roads connecting its facilities. These supply routes have resulted in deforestation and left a lasting imprint on the region's mountains.",
      "While a few of the bases date back to the 1990s, 89% have been constructed since 2018, after which Turkey began significantly expanding its military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "The Turkish government didn't respond to the BBC's requests for interviews, but has maintained that its military bases are necessary to push back the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara and a number of Western nations, including the UK.",
      "The sub-district capital of Kani Masi, which is only 4km (2.5 miles) from the Iraqi-Turkish border and parts of which are within the Forbidden Zone, may offer a glimpse into Sergele's future.",
      "Once famous for its apple production, few residents remain here now.",
      "Farmer Salam Saeed, whose land is in the shadow of a large Turkish base, hasn't been able to cultivate his vineyard for the past three years.",

      "\"They will shoot you if you stay.\"",
      "The Turkish military first set up here in the 1990s and has been consolidating its presence since.",
      "Its main military base, featuring concrete blast walls, watch and communication towers and space for armoured personnel carriers to move inside, is much more developed than the smaller outposts around Sergele.",
      "Salam, like some other locals, believes Turkey ultimately wants to claim the territory as its own.",
      "\"All they want is for us to leave these areas,\" he adds.",
      "Little leverage",
      "Near Kani Masi, the BBC saw first-hand how Turkish forces have effectively pushed back the Iraqi border guard, which is responsible for protecting Iraq's international boundaries.",
      "At several locations, the border guards were manning positions well inside Iraqi territory, directly opposite Turkish troops, unable to go right up to the border and potentially risk a clash.",
      "\"The posts that you see are Turkish posts,\" says General Farhad Mahmoud, pointing to a ridge just across a valley, about 10km (6 miles) inside Iraqi territory.",
      "But \"we cannot reach the border to know the number of posts\", he adds.",
      "Turkey's military expansion in Iraqi Kurdistan - fuelled by its rise as a drone power and growing defence budget - is seen as part of a broader foreign policy shift towards greater interventionism in the region.",
      "Similar to its operations in Iraq, Turkey has also sought to establish a buffer zone along its border with Syria to contain Syrian armed groups allied with the PKK.",
      "In public, Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence in the country. But behind closed doors it has accommodated some of Ankara's demands.",
      "In 2024, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly fight the PKK.",
      "But the document, obtained by the BBC, did not place any limitations on Turkish troops in Iraq.",
      "Iraq depends on Turkey for trade, investment and water security, while its fractured internal politics have further undermined the government's ability to take a strong stance.",
      "Iraq's national government did not respond to the BBC requests for comment.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",
      "Meanwhile, the rulers of the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan have a close relationship with Ankara based on mutual interests and have often downplayed the civilian harm due to Turkey's military action.",
      "The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), an arch enemy of the PKK, dominates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and has officially been in charge since 2005, when Iraq's constitution granted the region its semi-autonomous status.",
      "The KDP's close ties with Turkey have contributed to the region's economic success and have strengthened its position, both against its regional political rivals and with the Iraqi government in Baghdad, with which it tussles for greater autonomy.",
      "Hoshyar Zebari, a senior member of the KDP's politburo, sought to blame the PKK for Turkey's presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "\"They [the Turkish military] are not harming our people,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They are not detaining them. They are not interfering in them going about their business. Their focus, their sole goal is the PKK.\"",
      "The conflict shows no signs of ending, despite the PKK's long-jailed leader Abdulla Ocalan calling in February for his fighters to lay down arms and disband.",
      "Turkey has continued to shell targets across Iraqi Kurdistan, while the PKK claimed responsibility for downing a Turkish drone last month.",
      "And while violent incidents in Turkey have declined since 2016, according to a tally by the NGO Crisis Group, those in Iraq have spiked, with civilians living on the border region facing growing risk of death and displacement.",
      "One of those killed was 24-year-old Alan Ismail, a stage-four cancer patient hit by an air strike in August 2023 while on a trip to the mountains with his cousin, Hashem Shaker.",
      "The Turkish military has denied carrying out a strike that day, but a police report seen by the BBC attributes the incident to a Turkish drone.",
      "When Hashem filed a complaint in a local court about the attack he was detained by Kurdish security forces and held for eight months on suspicion of supporting the PKK - an accusation he and his family deny.",
      "\"It has destroyed us. It's like killing the whole family,\" says Ismail Chichu, Alan's father.",
      "\"They [the Turks] have no rights to kill people in their own country on their own land.\"",
      "Turkey's Defence Ministry did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment. It has previously told the media that the Turkish armed forces follow international law, and that in the planning and execution of their operations they only target terrorists, while taking care to prevent harm to civilians.",
      "The BBC has seen documents suggesting Kurdish authorities may have acted to help Turkey evade accountability for civilian casualties.",
      "Confidential papers seen by the BBC show a Kurdish court closed the investigation into Alan's killing, saying the perpetrator was unknown.",
      "And his death certificate - issued by Kurdish authorities and seen by the BBC - says he died because of \"explosive fragments\".",
      "Failing to mention when victims of air strikes have died as a result of violence, rather than an accident, makes it difficult for families to seek justice and compensation, to which they're entitled under both Iraqi and Kurdish law.",
      "\"In most of the death certificates, they only wrote 'infijar', which means explosion,\" says Kamaran Othman from Community Peacemaker Teams.",
      "\"It can be anything exploding.",
      "\"I think the Kurdish Regional Government doesn't want to make Turkey responsible for what they are doing here.\"",
      "The KRG said it acknowledged the \"tragic loss of civilians resulting from military confrontation between the PKK and Turkish army in the region\".",
      "It added that \"a number of casualties\" had been documented as \"civilian martyrs\", meaning they have been unjustly killed and entitling them to compensation.",
      "Almost two years after Alan was killed, his family is still waiting, if not for compensation, at least for acknowledgement from the KRG.",
      "\"They could at least send their condolences - we don't need their compensation,\" says Ismail.",
      "\"When something is gone, it's gone forever.\""

      "\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.",
      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",
      "Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.",
      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",
      "\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"",

      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",
      "But even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.",
      "\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"",
      "But he says he bears no anger anymore.",
      "\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",

      "After entering this small Indigenous community near Cairns in far north Queensland, with fishing nets sitting on palm-lined shores, the only thing fighting for attention is a truck selling ice cream \u2013 urgently dinging a bell as it avoids the wild horses and dogs that wander the streets.",
      "\"It's weird,\" says Suzanne Andrews, chief executive of the town's Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. \"We don't see any placards. No-one's visiting us.\"",
      "Watching the leaders of Australia's two major parties debate each other on television, the Jaru Bunuba Bardi woman was dismayed that \"they didn't talk about any Aboriginal issues or concerns\".",
      "\"So,\" she asks \"what the hell's going on?\"",
      "Indigenous Australians, who represent about 3.8% of the nation's 26 million population, are by most socio-economic measures the most disadvantaged people in the country - something successive leaders have for years called a \"national shame\".",
      "Yet in this election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.",
      "One glaring exception occurred this week, when during the final leader's debate Dutton said Indigenous \"welcome to country\" ceremonies -  where a local Aboriginal person acknowledges and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands - were \"overdone\" and should not take place so frequently.",
      "The comments represent one of the only times on the campaign trail that Dutton has publicly addressed issues specifically relating to First Nations people \u2013 and not to discuss disadvantage, but within the context of a culture war.",
      "Part of the reason politicians try to steer clear of First Nations issues, according to experts and advocates, is that many believe they are too divisive and therefore electorally risky \u2013 especially after the failure of the Voice to Parliament referendum in 2023.",
      "That referendum, which was loudly supported by Albanese in the most polarising moment of his leadership, saw 60% of voters reject a proposal to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's constitution and give them greater political say through a Voice to Parliament.",
      "Those opposing it said the idea was divisive, would create special \"classes\" of citizens where some have more rights than others, and the new advisory body would slow government decision-making.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on both sides of the debate told the BBC they hoped the unprecedented level of interest in their lives would build momentum for more policies to improve them.",
      "Ms Andrews was one of them. But now she looks back at the result with sadness, believing it has now led political parties to \"play it safe\" and avoid \"the hot Aboriginal issues\".",
      "Others, including those who loudly opposed the Voice proposal, agree.",
      "On referendum night, prominent anti-Voice campaigner Warren Mundine told the BBC \"now the hard work starts\".",
      "Some 18 months on, he says the reality is that people on both sides of the political aisle promptly disengaged with Indigenous issues after the referendum.",
      "\"This is one of the sad things about this election campaign here: whether the Voice got up or didn't get up, we still had work to do,\" he said.",
      "\"What's happened now is that this is probably the first election that I've been in where there is no conversation about an Aboriginal policy. It's just gone silent.\"",
      "Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator in Victoria, told the BBC that \"Albanese particularly is too scared to mention us [Indigenous Australians] because of his failed referendum that we should never have had in the first place\".",
      "Thorpe spearheaded an Indigenous-run Blak Sovereign movement opposing the Voice, calling instead for priority to be given to a legally binding treaty between First Nations peoples and the Australian government.",
      "\"In previous elections, even though we may have been an afterthought and tacked on the end of the sentences, like we always are, at least we were mentioned. Now it's complete silence,\" she said.",
      "\"This election could have been a real opportunity for both leaders to unite the nation and tell some truth about the plight of our people. They need to tell the truth that these injustices continue, and they need to tell the truth that they are in a position to change that, to turn that around.\"",
      "Since 2008, the Australian government's Closing the Gap strategy has sought to reduce levels of Indigenous disadvantage through the annual tracking of 18 key measures in areas such as health and education.",
      "The latest review, however, found only four were on track to be met, while four were worsening \u2013 including the annual rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration, which was up 12% in a year.",
      "Despite these trends, Professor Rodney Smith of the University of Sydney says the defeat of the Voice - including in many Labor strongholds - makes it \"electorally foolish\" to talk too much about First Nations issues this election.",
      "He points to Coalition adverts that tie money \"wasted\" on the referendum \u2013 which is estimated to have cost more than $A400m \u2013 into the discussion about cost of living and a struggling economy.",
      "Prof Smith also argues, however, that the 2025 election is not unprecedented in its lack of focus on Indigenous affairs, but rather a return to the norm after several years of the issues receiving more attention than usual.",
      "\"I'm not saying people shouldn't care about this,\" he says. \"I'm just saying that generally speaking, the electorate doesn't particularly care about it.\"",
      "Recent data from Australian National University (ANU) seems to back that up. A long-term study of voter attitudes found that between January 2024 and January 2025 there was a sharp decline in the number of people believing it was the government's responsibility to reduce the gap in living standards between First Nations Australians and the rest of the population.",
      "\"This lack of policy focus (by Labor and the Coalition) reflects a low prioritisation amongst the Australian population\" ANU's Professor Nicholas Biddle said.",

      "He also admits he doesn't talk about those issues on the campaign trail, though.",
      "\"As a politician that's got to win votes in the election, I wouldn't be game,\" he told the BBC.",

      "A report published by Sydney's University of Technology last month found that the Voice referendum led to an increase in hostile levels of racism towards First Nations People, recording 453 \"validated\" incidents of racism roughly six months either side of the vote.",
      "About a fifth of all complaints contained mention of the failed referendum.",
      "\"While there was significant thought and debate given to the ideas of nation building and the righting of wrongs, the undercurrent of racism was ever present,\" said the report's guest author Professor Lindon Coombes in his introduction.",
      "\"This is its insidiousness.\"",
      "In Yarrabah, Ms Andrews becomes suddenly tearful, telling how her two daughters, studying at university in Brisbane, were intimidated and got \"so many racist remarks\" after the vote.",

    "story": [
      "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.",
      "But the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear.",
      "The grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"",
      "Information is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.",
      "Here is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.",
      "Follow live: Travel chaos continues",
      "Was the power cut caused by renewable energy?",
      "S\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".",
      "Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.",
      "One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.",
      "However, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.",
      "So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.",
      "The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.",
      "If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.",
      "\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.",
      "If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.",
      "But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.",
      "Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.",
      "\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.",
      "Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.",
      "\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.",
      "\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"",
      "Was it related to Spain's connection to France?",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.",
      "Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.",
      "Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.",
      "The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.",
      "Was it linked to a 'rare atmospheric event'?",
      "Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.",
      "The message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".",
      "\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\"",
      "However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

    "summary": "Mark Carney's party pull off an election win that once looked near-impossible, until the US president targeted Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election \u2013 and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump.",
      "The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party.",
      "Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.",
      "The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.",
      "This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.",
      "He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.",

      "No one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)",
      "Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.",
      "The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",
      "While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.",
      "A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.",
      "Although Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge.",
      "Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.",
      "Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.",
      "The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.",
      "Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test."

      "Victor I (189-199)",
      "Thought to be of Berber origin, Pope Victor I was in charge of the Catholic Church at a time when Christians were sometimes being persecuted by Roman officials for refusing to worship Roman gods.",
      "He is perhaps best known for ensuring Christians celebrate Easter on a Sunday.",
      "In the 2nd Century, some Christian groups from the Roman province of Asia (in modern-day Turkey) celebrated Easter on the same day that Jews celebrated Passover, which could fall on different days of the week.",
      "However, Christians in the Western part of the Empire believed that Jesus was resurrected on a Sunday, so Easter should always be celebrated on that day.",
      "The debate over when the resurrection took place made it an extremely contentious issue.",
      "The \"Easter controversy\" was symbolic of larger conflicts between East and West, and whether or not Christians should follow Jewish practices.",
      "Victor I called the very first Roman Synod - a gathering of Church leaders - to resolve the impasse.",
      "He did this by threatening to excommunicate from the Church those bishops who refused to comply with his wishes.",
      "\"He was a rather forceful voice for getting everyone on literally the same page,\" Prof Bellitto told the BBC.",
      "This was an impressive feat, the historian said, because \"he was the Bishop of Rome when Christianity was illegal in the Roman empire.\"",
      "Another important part of Victor I's legacy was to introduce Latin as the common language of the Catholic Church. Previously Ancient Greek was the primary language of the Catholic Liturgy as well as official communication for the Church.",
      "Victor I himself wrote in - and spoke - Latin, which was widely spoken in North Africa.",
      "Miltiades (AD311-314)",
      "Pope Miltiades is believed to have been born in Africa.",
      "During his reign, Christianity gained increasing acceptance from successive Roman emperors, eventually becoming the Empire's official religion.",
      "Before this, the persecution of Christians had been widespread at different points in the Empire's history.",
      "However, Prof Bellitto pointed out that Miltiades was not responsible for this change, saying the Pope was the \"recipient of the Roman benevolence\" rather than being a great negotiator.",
      "Miltiades was given a palace by the Roman Emperor Constantine, becoming the first pope to have an official residence.",
      "He was also granted permission by Constantine to build the Lateran Basilica, now the oldest public church in Rome.",
      "While modern popes live and work in the Vatican, the Lateran church is sometimes referred to in Catholicism as \"the mother of all churches\".",
      "Gelasius I (AD492-496)",
      "Gelasius I is the only one of the three African popes who historians believe was not born in Africa.",
      "\"There's a reference to him being... Roman-born. So we don't know if he [ever] lived in North Africa, but it seems clear that he was of North African descent,\" Prof Bellitto explained.",
      "He was the most important of the three African church leaders, according to Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is widely recognised as the first pope to officially be called the \"Vicar of Christ\", a term that signifies the Pope's role as Christ's representative on Earth.",
      "He also developed the Doctrine of the Two Swords, which emphasised the separate-but-equal powers of the Church and the state.",
      "Gelasius I made the critical distinction that both powers were given to the Church by God, who then delegated earthly power to the state, making the Church ultimately superior.",
      "\"Later on, in the Middle Ages, popes sometimes tried to veto the selection of an emperor or a king, because they said God gave them that power,\" said Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is remembered, too, for his response to the Acacian Schism - a split between the Eastern and Western Christian Churches from 484 to 519.",
      "During this period, Gelasius I asserted the supremacy of Rome and the papacy over the entire Church, East and West, which experts believe went further than any of his predecessors.",
      "Gelasius is also responsible for a popular celebration which is still marked every year - establishing St Valentine's Day on 14 February in 496 to commemorate the Christian martyr St Valentine.",
      "Some accounts say Valentine was a priest who continued to perform weddings in secret when they were banned by Emperor Claudius II.",
      "Historians believe that Valentine's Day is rooted in the Roman love and fertility festival, Lupercalia, and was a move by Gelasius I to Christianise pagan traditions.",
      "What did Africa's popes look like?",
      "Prof Bellitto says there is no way of knowing with any degree of accuracy what the three popes looked like.",
      "\"We have to remember that the Roman Empire, and indeed the Middle Ages, didn't think of race as we think of it nowadays. It had nothing to do with skin colour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"People in the Roman Empire didn't deal with race, they dealt with ethnicity.\"",
      "Prof Philomena Mwaura, an academic at Kenya's Kenyatta University, told the BBC that Roman Africa was very multicultural, with local Berber and Punic groups, freed slaves and people who had come from Rome found there.",
      "\"The North African community was quite mixed, and it was a trade route also for many people who were involved in trade in the earlier antiquity,\" she explained.",
      "Rather than identifying with specific ethnic groups, \"most people who belonged to areas within the Roman Empire regarded themselves as Roman\", Prof Mwaura added.",
      "Who will be the next Pope?How a Pope is electedWhy the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Who will be the next Pope?",
      "How a Pope is elected",
      "Why the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Why hasn't there been an African pope since?",
      "None of of the 217 popes since Gelasius I are believed to have come from Africa.",
      "\"The church in North Africa was weakened by very many forces, including the fall of the Roman Empire and also the incursion of Muslims [into North Africa] in the 7th Century,\" Prof Mwaura said.",
      "However, some experts argue that the prevalence of Islam in North Africa does not explain the absence of a pope from the entire continent over more than 1,500 years.",
      "Prof Bellitto said the process of electing a new pontiff became an \"Italian monopoly\" for many years.",
      "However, he said there was a strong chance of a pope from Asia or Africa in the near future because Catholics in the southern hemisphere outnumber those in the north.",
      "In fact, Catholicism is expanding more rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa today than anywhere else.",
      "The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023. This accounts for 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "Three Africans are in the race to succeed Pope Francis - the Democratic Republic of Congo's Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, Ghana's Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson and Guinea's Robert Sarah.",
      "But Prof Mwaura argued that \"although Christianity is very strong in Africa, the power of the Church is still in the north, where the resources have been\".",
      "\"Maybe, as it continues to be very strong within the continent and supporting itself, then a time will come when there could be an African pope,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar accused each other of lies or inaccuracies in sworn depositions.",
    "story": [
      "The head of Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency has resigned.",
      "Ronen Bar made the announcement that he would leave his position on 15 June at a memorial event for Shin Bet members who have died in service.",
      "It came after he had been engaged in a fierce trading of recriminations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who dismissed him last month. A challenge to the Supreme Court by the attorney general and the opposition had put the move on hold.",
      "Ronen Bar said he had chosen to announce his resignation on an evening that, in his words, symbolised \"remembrance, heroism and sacrifice\".",
      "He said every public servant who failed to stop the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the Gaza war, needed to bow their heads \"humbly before those who were killed, or wounded, or taken hostage, and act accordingly\".",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu presented an affidavit to the Supreme Court in which he accused Bar of being a liar.",
      "In his own affidavit, the Shin Bet chief had accused the prime minister of demanding excessive personal loyalty and ordering his agency to spy on anti-government protesters.",
      "The confrontation has further exposed the deepening rifts in Israeli politics and society between the right-wing and hardliners supporting Netanyahu and the more liberal elements in the country, who took to the streets to protest against the government's moves to curb the powers of the judiciary for many months before the 7 October attacks.",
      "It centres on Netanyahu's insistence that he fired the Shin Bet head for professional failures.",
      "Bar countered by saying that his dismissal was motivated by political and personal considerations.",
      "In his affidavit last week, the spy chief said that it was \"clear\" that if there were to be a constitutional crisis, Netanyahu would expect him to obey the prime minister and not the courts.",
      "He also said Netanyahu had put pressure on him to use the Shin Bet to spy on Israelis leading or providing financial support to anti-government protests.",
      "Many in Israel reacted with alarm, saying it was evidence of what appeared to be an unprecedented effort to overstep the powers of the domestic intelligence agency.",
      "In his affidavit, which functioned as a form of rebuttal, Netanyahu excoriated the Shin Bet head.",
      "\"The accusation according to which I allegedly demanded action against innocent civilians, or against a non-violent and legitimate protest during the protests of 2023, is an absolute lie,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also trained his sights on the security failures in the lead-up to and during the 7 October attacks, saying that Bar bore \"massive and direct responsibility\" for them and had \"failed in his role as chief of Shin Bet and lost the confidence of the entire Israeli government as far as his ability to continue to manage the organisation\".",
      "Bar immediately responded in kind in a statement, saying Netanyahu's affidavit was \"full of inaccuracies, biased quotes and half-truths aimed at taking things out of context and changing reality\".",
      "The Supreme Court was facing a quandary over who to believe - which Bar's resignation may have to some extent pre-empted.",
      "However, Bar made clear on Monday that he would play a part, if necessary, in any future proceedings.",
      "\"The court hearing is not about my personal affairs, but about the independence of the next heads of the Shin Bet, and of course I am ready to appear for any procedure that the court may require in this regard in the future,\" he said.",
      "The issues which have been exposed in the fierce recriminations between the two men have once again focused attention on the increasing bitterness between opposed sections of Israeli society.",
      "These have been further exacerbated by the ever-growing fault line between those who support Netanyahu and his hard-line government in wanting to continue the war in Gaza to eliminate Hamas at all costs, and those who believe the fate of the living Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas must be put first, even if it means ending the war.",

      "When is a ceasefire a genuine attempt to secure peace? And when is it simply PR?",
      "It's a question that's been asked a lot lately.",
      "Mostly in relation to Russia's president.",
      "Short ceasefires are becoming quite the Kremlin thing.",
      "First, Vladimir Putin declared a 30-hour cessation of hostilities over Easter, portraying it as a \"humanitarian\" gesture.",
      "Now the Kremlin leader has announced a three-day unilateral truce for early May. It will run from 8 May to 10 May to coincide with events marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.",
      "In a statement, the Kremlin said that for 72 hours all military actions would cease. It cited \"humanitarian\" considerations (again) and made it clear Moscow expected Ukraine to follow suit.",
      "In response to the proposal, Ukraine questioned why Russia could not commit to a ceasefire immediately and called for one to be implemented for at least 30 days.",
      "\"If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately,\" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said, adding: \"Why wait until May 8th?\"",
      "So, from the Russian president who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, is this a sincere effort to end the fighting?",
      "Or simply a public relations exercise by the Kremlin to impress Donald Trump?",
      "Kremlin critics will suspect PR.",
      "During the extremely brief so-called Easter ceasefire, Ukraine had accused Russian troops of violating it repeatedly.",
      "Moscow had used its announcement of a 30-hour pause in the fighting to send a signal to the White House: that in this war Russia is the peacemaker and Kyiv the aggressor. It accused Ukraine of ignoring what Moscow presented as an olive branch and of prolonging the war.",

      "\"It makes me think,\" he added, \"that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!\"",

      "Another attempt to signal to Washington that the Kremlin has only the best of intentions? That Russia is really the good guy in all of this?",
      "If so, it doesn't appear to have worked. Not immediately. The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted Moscow's offer of a temporary ceasefire, but said: \"The president [Donald Trump] has made it clear he wants to see a permanent ceasefire first to stop the killing, stop the bloodshed.",
      "\"He is increasingly frustrated with leaders of both countries,\" Leavitt said.",
      "It's an indication that the US president may be losing patience now with the Kremlin, despite having directed most of his public criticism in recent months towards President Zelensky.",
      "Last month the Trump administration was pushing both Russia and Ukraine to agree to a 30-day comprehensive unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine had signed up to that. Russia did not.",
      "Already senior Russian officials are using President Putin's three-day ceasefire offer to try to cast Ukraine in a bad light.",
      "\"It is doubtful that [President] Zelensky will support the decision of our president and accept the ceasefire,\" the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, told Russian state TV.",
      "Hardly an encouraging sign, so soon after the announcement of another brief ceasefire."

      "What follows is BBC Africa Eye's detailed timeline of events as Kenya's MPs entered parliament for the final vote on the government's controversial finance bill, while protesters amassed on the streets outside on Tuesday 25 June 2024.",
      "Warning: This story contains images of dead bodies",
      "Young people, labelled Gen Z protesters who had mobilised themselves on social media, began streaming into central Nairobi early in the morning - in what would be the capital's third large-scale protest since the finance bill was introduced on 9 May.",
      "\"It was a beautiful party,\" says prominent human rights activist Boniface Mwangi, who was there.",
      "\"Kids came out with Bluetooth speakers and their water. It was a carnival.\"",
      "Protests earlier in the week had already led lawmakers to axe tax increases on bread, cooking oil, mobile money and motor vehicles, as well as an eco levy that would have raised the cost of goods like nappies and sanitary towels.",
      "But other measures to raise the $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) the government said it needed to cut its reliance on external borrowing, such as higher import taxes and another on specialised hospitals, remained.",
      "\"For the first time it was the Kenyan people - the working class and the middle class and the lower class - against the ruling class,\" says Mwangi.",
      "The protesters had one target - parliament, where the final vote was taking place.",
      "By 09:30 local time, the last of the MPs filed into the lower house.",
      "Outside, thousands pushed towards Parliament Road from the east, north and west of the city.",
      "\"For me, it was just a normal day,\" says 26-year-old student journalist Ademba Allans.",
      "People were livestreaming on their TikTok and Instagram accounts, while events were broadcast live on national TV, he adds.",
      "At first, protesters were held back at roadblocks by tear gas and truncheons, then police started using water cannons and rubber bullets.",
      "By 13:00, more than 100,000 people were on the streets.",
      "\"The numbers start getting bigger and people actually start getting arrested,\" says Allans. \"The police are everywhere. They're trying to push people back. People are even climbing on top of those water cannons.\"",
      "Despite the growing chaos outside, MPs remained in the chamber and the voting began.",
      "By 14:00, protesters had pushed police all the way back to the north-eastern corner of parliament.",
      "Inside at 14:14, the Finance Bill 2024 was voted in: 195 in favour, 106 against. Opposition MPs stormed out and word instantly reached the masses outside.",
      "\"This is when everybody is saying: 'Whatever happens, we are going to enter the parliament and show the MPs that we believe in what we're fighting for,'\" says Allans.",
      "At 14:20, protesters finally broke through the police blockade and reached the road running alongside parliament.",
      "An abandoned police truck stationed outside the gates was set on fire. Fences were torn down and protesters set foot on parliamentary grounds. The incursion was short-lived. Parliamentary security forces quickly cleared them out.",
      "At the same time, police officers went back up Parliament Road in force to drive the protesters back.",
      "While this was happening, journalists were filming, producing minute-by-minute footage from many angles.",
      "One of those videos captured a plain-clothes police officer shouting \"uaa!\", the Swahili word for \"kill\". Seconds later, a police officer knelt, gunshots were heard and protesters in the crowd collapsed - seven in total.",
      "David Chege, a 39-year-old software engineer and Sunday-school teacher, and Ericsson Mutisya, a 25-year-old butcher, were shot dead. Five other men were wounded, one of whom was left paralysed from the waist down.",

      "But who fired those shots?",
      "In the video of the officer shouting, \"uaa!\", the shooter's back was to the camera. But the BBC compared his body armour, riot shield and headgear with that of every police officer at the scene.",
      "In his case, he had an upturned neck guard. We matched his distinctive uniform to an officer in a video recorded seconds later. There, he made sure to hide his face before firing into the crowd. We do not know his name.",
      "Even after the fatal shots, the plain-clothes officer could still be heard urging his colleagues forward to \"kill\". He was not so cautious about concealing his identity: his name is John Kaboi.",
      "Multiple sources have told the BBC he is based at the Central Nairobi Police Station.",
      "The BBC put its allegations to Kenya's police service, which said the force could not investigate itself, adding that the IPOA was responsible for investigating alleged misconduct.",

      "No-one has been held accountable for the deaths of Chege or Mutisya. The BBC found that neither of them was armed.",

      "At 14:57 they made it in.",
      "Footage shows them breaking down the fences and walking across the parliament's grounds. Many had their hands up. Others were holding placards or the Kenyan flag.",
      "Warning shots were fired. The demonstrators ducked down, then continued towards the building, filming on their phones as they went.",
      "Once inside, momentum turned to mayhem. Doors were kicked in, part of the complex was set alight and the last of the MPs fled the building.",
      "The destruction was severe but, after five minutes, footage showed them leaving the same way they had come in.",
      "At 15:04, shots rang out again and protesters tumbled across the flattened fence. As the smoke cleared, camera footage showed three bodies lying on the ground. Two were wounded - one raised his hand but could not get up.",
      "The third, 27-year-old finance student Eric Shieni, was dead - shot in the head from behind as he was leaving the grounds. The BBC again found, as in the cases of Chege and Mutisya, that he had been unarmed.",
      "BBC Africa Eye analysed more than 150 images taken during the minutes before and after Shieni was shot. We are able to identify the soldier who fired at the back of his head from 25m (82ft) away - again, we do not know his name.",
      "\"The video is very clear,\" says Faith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya.",
      "\"The aim was to kill those protesters. They could have had him arrested. But the fact that you shoot his head - it was clearly an intention to kill.",
      "\"You have become the judge, the jury and the sentence executioner for Eric.\"",
      "The Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF) told the BBC the IPOA had not forwarded any request to look into any of its personnel involved in the operations at parliament.",

      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",
      "Additional reporting by Mitch Labiak, Nicole Kolster, Gustavo Ocando Alex and Madeline Halpert.",

    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

    "summary": "Belichick's statement comes after segments of the interview posted to social media focused attention on the 73-year-old's relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
    "story": [
      "Former Patriots coach Bill Belichick says his recent\u00a0interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0created \"a false narrative\" about his relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
      "Belichick, 73, who is now head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sat down with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil ahead of the release of his new book, \"The Art of Winning,\" but many commenters online focused on the glimpses of his relationship with Hudson.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday, Belichick said, \"Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" the statement continued. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.\"",
      "A CBS News spokesperson\u00a0responded: \"When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview. There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.\"",
      "Belichick's statement comes after portions of the interview posted to social media\u00a0generated scrutiny\u00a0of his relationship.",
      "Out of the eight-minute segment that aired on \"Sunday Morning,\" Belichick and Dokoupil discussed Hudson, whom the football legend described in his upcoming book as his \"creative muse,\" for about one minute and 30 seconds.",
      "Dokoupil said in the recorded voiceover that Hudson was a \"constant presence\" during the interview. He asked Belichick, \"You have Jordon right over there. Everybody in the world seems to be following this relationship. They've got an opinion about your private life. It's got nothing to do with them, but they're invested in it. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "\"I've never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,\" Belichick replied. \"Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\"",
      "When Belichick was asked how the two of them met, Hudson spoke up: \"Not talking about this.\"",
      "In his statement Wednesday, Belichick defended Hudson.",
      "\"She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021,\" he said.",
      "\"The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career. Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "In a separate statement released Tuesday, Belichick's literary agent, InkWell Management, said the segments resulted in \"a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\"",
      "\"Bill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" InkWell Management said.",

    "summary": "The so-called \"Granddad Gang\" is on trial for allegedly tying up Kim Kardashian in a Paris residence in 2016 and stealing millions of dollars' worth of jewelry.",
    "story": [
      "A trial over the 2016 heist in which armed robbers tied up reality star Kim Kardashian in her bedroom and stole millions of dollars' worth of jewelry has begun in Paris.",
      "Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 are on trial on charges of robbery and kidnapping of the media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016. Two of them acknowledged their participation and the others denied it.",
      "Kardashian was in France for Fashion Week when men dressed as police officers allegedly tied her up with zip ties and duct tape, held her at gunpoint and stole $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian described being terrified, thinking she was going to be raped and killed when the criminals broke into her bedroom and pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun like clear as day,\" she said on her show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\" \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "Her lawyers said she will testify in person at the trial, with a provisional schedule showing that is expected to happen on May 13. The trial is scheduled to run through May 23.",
      "\"Ms. Kardashian is reserving her testimony for the court and jury and does not wish to elaborate further at this time,\" they said. \"She has great respect and admiration for the French justice system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities. She wishes the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion, in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",
      "Twelve people were originally expected in the defendants' box. One of them died and another is seriously ill and can't be tried. According to the investigation, five of the 10 defendants were present at the scene of the robbery.",
      "The \"Granddad Robbers\"",
      "The French press has dubbed them The Granddad Robbers because the main defendants are older \u2014 most in their 60s and 70s \u2014 and have been bank robbers with long criminal records.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery.",
      "Aomar Ait Khedache, now aged 69, was allegedly the mastermind behind the heist.",
      "Known as \"Old Omar\", he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "When the robbers arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where the celebrity was staying during Paris Fashion Week, they allegedly demanded the guard, at gunpoint, direct them to \"the rapper's wife\" \u2013 a reference to her then-husband, West.",
      "\"Old Omar\" reportedly wrote to Kardashian in 2017, when he was in custody, to say sorry. Her lawyers said he wrote to apologize after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "He left the hotel on a bicycle, as did two others, then met his son, who was waiting for him in a parked car at a nearby train station.",
      "The other man \u2014 77-year-old Yunice Abbas \u2014 has publicly admitted to being a lookout during the robbery.",
      "He said he was unarmed and did not personally threaten Kardashian, but admitted he shared responsibility for the crime.",
      "In 2021, he co-authored a French-language book titled \"I Sequestered Kim Kardashian.\"",
      "Abbas told reporters that he will apologize during the trial and will give details of his role in the heist but won't denounce anyone else.",
      "The other defendants are suspected of providing information about Kardashian's presence in the apartment. Others are accused of playing a role in the resale of the jewelry in Antwerp, Belgium.",
      "The gangsters stole many pieces of jewelry. Only one piece of jewelry \u2014 a diamond cross on platinum that was lost during the suspects' escape \u2014 has been recovered.",
      "Celebrity status could distract from trial",
      "As the trial opened Monday, lawyers for the accused told reporters outside the court that they were concerned that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "\"It's a simple case with people who will accept responsibility, who regret what they've done,\" said Frank Berton, lawyer for Khedache.",
      "Another of his lawyers, Chloe Arnoux, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "The lawyer for night watchman Abderrahmane Ouatiki told journalists on his way into court that he was tired of suggestions that the robbers who allegedly forced his client at gunpoint to direct them to Kardashian's suite were \"kind old men.\"",
      "\"The people in front of him that day were not Robin Hoods, they were experienced, determined criminals who did not hesitate to threaten him while he was working nights to finance his studies,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:07:09 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter - subject of the new Broadway musical \"Just in Time\" - was renowned for such pop hits as \"Splish Splash,\" \"Mack the Knife,\" and \"Dream Lover.\" But his life was unsettled when he learned, at age 32, the startling truth about the identity of his mother.",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Darin was a major pop star \u2026 a singer, dancer, musician, and an Oscar nominee. He was the entertainer who did it all, except Broadway. Until now!",
      "Tony Award-winner Jonathan Groff (\"Merrily We Roll Along\") plays the icon of the late 1950s and '60s in the musical \"Just in Time.\" \"He was at the height of his powers, when he was on the floor of a nightclub with the audience in the palm of his hand,\" said Groff.",
      "For Darin, a live audience was oxygen. So, too, for Groff: \"You can feel this vibration between performer and audience member. [It's], to me, the most essential thing to ignite in the telling of his story.\"",
      "It's taken seven years and a whole lot of sweat to bring the show to Broadway. The casting of Groff \u2013 beloved for his roles on stage, and as Kristoff in the \"Frozen\" movies \u2013 might not seem obvious. Groff grew up on a horse farm in Pennsylvania Mennonite country; Darin was a scrappy Italian kid from the Bronx.",
      "I asked Groff to whom he liked listening when he was growing up. \"I am in fourth or fifth grade, on the computer or Nintendo in the basement, blasting Ethel Merman, 'Annie Get Your Gun,'\" he laughed.",
      "\"So, this is the 1990s, probably? And you're playing something from the 1940s?\"",
      "\"Exactly!\"",
      "Likewise, Bobby Darin was an old soul, says his son, Dodd Darin. \"He admired, he loved, he respected the old timers. He loved that era of show business. That's what he related to.\"",
      "That may have had something to do with the woman who raised him: \"Polly, his mother, was an old vaudevillian,\" said Dodd. \"And she nurtured him and said, 'You can't play stickball in the street. And you can't roughhouse with kids' ('cause he was frail and sickly). 'But you can learn to sing. You can learn to dance. You can learn to play piano.' And it opened a whole world.\"",
      "\"Frail and sickly\" was no exaggeration. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Darin suffered several bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, permanently damaging his heart. When he was a boy, he overheard a family doctor say that he wouldn't live beyond his teenage years. \"Put yourself in that position,\" said Dodd. \"So, he was ambitious. He was driven. He was always on the go. He was trying to jam it all in, 'cause he knew he didn't have time.\"",
      "With no time to waste, he began writing songs, and at 22, Bobby Darin made waves with a recording of \"Splish Splash.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Splish Splash\" (1958):",
      "Not one to play it safe, for his second album, in 1959, Darin took a dark ballad from the German \"Threepenny Opera\" and made it swing. \"When my dad took 'Mack the Knife' before it was released and had Dick Clark listen to it, he said, 'Why are you doing this? This is gonna bomb!'\" Dodd said.",
      "It won the Grammy for record of the year, and became the biggest hit of Darin's career.",
      "The next year, he was on his way to Italy to make his motion picture debut opposite America's sweetheart, Sandra Dee. \"We hit it right off,\" Darin said. \"She hated me and I loved her, and that was it.\"",
      "The teen idol married the teen movie star in December of 1960, and welcomed their son, Dodd, a year later. Dodd would later write, \"My father made his destiny. Destiny made my mother.\"",
      "What did he mean by that? \"Well, my mom went through a lot,\" he said. \"Never really wanted fame. She really didn't crave it. It just sort of happened. Unlike my dad, who loved performing, loved show business.\"",
      "Dee was looking for a home life, said Dodd, but Bobby Darin wasn't ready to slow down. The marriage ended after six years. Darin never stopped playing the clubs.",
      "Sammy Davis Jr. once said that Bobby Darin was the one person he wouldn't want to have to follow. \"Absolutely true,\" said Dodd. \"My dad idolized Sammy.\"",
      "The feeling was mutual, as seen in a 1959 broadcast of \"This Is Your Life\":",
      "Also featured during the episode was Nina, the woman Darin thought was his sister. But almost a decade later he would learn a long-held family secret: Nina was in fact Bobby's mother, having given birth to him out of wedlock as a teenager. Which made Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, his grandmother. \"He was never the same,\" said Dodd. \"He said that his whole life was a lie; he was, like, a fraud. It's just devastating. There's no sugarcoating it.\"",
      "Looking at that tape today, says Dodd, it all seems obvious. \"That's a mother's love,\" he said. \"That's not a sister, okay? That's the adulation of, 'This is my son,' but you can't say it.\"",
      "Dodd, who was seven years old when his father found out, remembers a change in your father from that time: \"I'm not gonna say it's directly attributed to that incident; I'm sure that's part of it. But he got into the Bob Darin stage, you know? He took off his toupee. No more tuxedo. Started doing folk music, protest music, writing music, and dropped out of show business for a while.",
      "\"And that was some of the best times I had with him. He was a regular dude. We were up in Big Sur in a trailer, hanging out. And yeah, he let his hair down, if you will. It was good times.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Simple Song of Freedom\" (1970):",
      "In December of 1973, Bobby Darin's heart finally gave out. He was 37. Dodd had just turned 12. Now 63, Dodd Darin is grateful that, with the new Broadway show, a new generation can learn the story of his father.",
      "\"It's so beautiful that all these years later \u2013 he's been gone over 50 years \u2013 we're here talking about him. We're remembering him,\" said Dodd. \"He did something right.\"",

      "Diabetes deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate data for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",
      "Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately.",
      "\"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\" Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.",

    "summary": "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said there is a \"void of data\" on the COVID booster shots.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve COVID-19 vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.",
      "\"We're taking a look. I can't comment on any particular application. As you know, we have a bunch of applications for those booster shots,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.",
      "Makary said many health care workers did not get the last round of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, calling it \"a bit of a public trust problem.\"",
      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also now weighing whether to significantly narrow its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",
      "Multiple companies are now also being asked \"to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with,\" Makary told CBS News.",
      "\"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them,\" he said.",
      "He also praised his special assistant, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg, when asked what role she played in the agency's evaluation of Novavax's application.",
      "\"Dr. H\u00f8eg is an amazing M.D.-Ph.D. who has joined my staff as a special assistant to the commissioner. And she is involved in reviewing data sets at the agency. And I'm really excited to have her in the process,\" Makary said.",
      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",
      "Former FDA officials have criticized the agency's new political leadership for their intervention in vaccine approvals, a process which is usually entrusted to career scientific officials.",
      "In a commentary\u00a0published this week, former officials Phil Krause and Luciana Borio called on the FDA to \"stick to its normal processes.\"",
      "\"Shifting standards and late-stage demands for new data \u2014 based on faulty scientific assumptions \u2014 erode trust, delay access to important tools, and discourage developers from advancing vaccine innovation,\" they wrote.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 20:05:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Some FDA scientists and inspections staff were told that their layoffs may be rescinded.",
    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials have told some scientists and inspections staff that their layoffs will be reversed, after the job cuts led to disruptions in drug and food safety work.",
      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services blamed errors in the layoffs on inaccurate data from the department's \"siloed HR divisions.\"",
      "\"This is exactly why HHS is reorganizing its administrative functions to streamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us by the Biden Administration. Streamlining this into one operation will allow for enhanced data integrity and coordination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said some layoffs would be walked back, like to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lead poisoning teams. But that reversal never ended up happening, leaving the agency's lead poisoning work largely abandoned.",
      "Some CDC laboratories also remain closed, including the agency's now-shuttered labs for investigating outbreaks of hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases or for worker safety, like oversight of N95 masks.",
      "FDA inspections falling behind",
      "Around two dozen of the support staff for the FDA's inspectors have been told their layoffs would be reversed, out of nearly 200 who were cut. The employees being restored are focused on booking travel for foreign inspections.",
      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",
      "Some of the agency's work to detect and investigate fraudulent medical products had also effectively stalled, they said, amid complications around transferring the custody of the samples and a backlog of work that predated the April 1 layoffs.",
      "The FDA's labs had already been struggling with new hurdles to purchasing that had slowed their work, as staff waited for weeks in some cases for supply orders, officials said.",

      "A Department of Health and Human Services official said Friday that the health department is not creating an autism registry, contradicting an announcement made days ago by the director of the National Institutes of Health describing his plans to study causes of autism.",
      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",

      "Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm said the electric vehicle maker's board has not contacted recruitment firms to start a search for a new CEO\u00a0to replace Elon Musk.",
      "Denholm was responding to a report in the Wall Street Journal that said board members had reached out to several hiring firms to work on a formal process for finding a new Tesla CEO. The report also said that Tesla board members told Musk he needed to spend more time at the company.",
      "\"Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,\" Denholm wrote in a May 1 post on X, the social media app owned by Musk. \"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).\"",
      "The Journal's report comes after Tesla's first-quarter sales and profit\u00a0took a hit amid a backlash from some consumers about Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Led by Musk, the cost-cutting task force has overseen the mass firings of federal workers, including more than 216,000 government employees terminated from their jobs in March.",

      "\"The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,\" Denholm added in her statement.",
      "On the April 22 earnings call, Musk acknowledged that his role in the Trump administration has \"some blowback.\" But he also praised DOGE's work in cutting what he claims is waste, fraud and abuse in government spending.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-tax-cut-below-200000-income-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 08:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says steep tariffs on U.S. imports will lead to lower taxes for Americans. Is he right?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump describes his administration's sweeping new tariffs on other countries as a tool for accomplishing a range of key economic goals, including reviving U.S. manufacturing. Recently, he's been highlighting another aim: Lowering, or even eliminating, individual income taxes for most Americans.",
      "\"When Tariffs cut in, many people's Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" he wrote Sunday on Truth Social, his social media app.",
      "Tariffs are already kicking in, with businesses around the country facing import duties of 145% or more on imports from China and tariffs of 10% on goods shipped from almost every other nation. Many Americans say they disapprove of these import duties, which are typically passed onto consumers through higher prices, and are bracing for higher inflation as the costs trickle through the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments also point to his earlier assertions that higher tariffs could raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenue in the next year or so. On Sunday, before boarding Air Force One to return from Pope Francis' funeral, Mr. Trump asserted that the revenue raised by his tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax\" in the U.S.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether the Trump administration is developing a proposal to cut taxes for most Americans.",
      "What's the link between tariffs and taxes?",
      "Currently, there is no tax bill in Congress \u2014 the arm of government with the authority to change the tax code \u2014 that would eliminate federal income taxes for people earning $200,000 or less. Even so, the House is working on a reconciliation bill that would extend Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add a few new reductions promised by the president on the campaign trail, such as eliminating taxes on employee tips.",
      "If passed, that bill would mean individuals would continue to pay the same tax rates they've paid since Mr. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took effect beginning for the 2018 tax year, with\u00a0individual tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%, depending on a person's income. And if the legislation is enacted, notably, most Americans would see no difference in their federal income tax rate.",
      "\"There is no real connection\" between Mr. Trump's tariffs and lower taxes, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues. \"He has the authority to impose higher tariffs, and he's done that. But he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cut income taxes \u2014 that's done by Congress.\"",
      "There is \"zero chance\" that Congress would eliminate income taxes for a large swath of the U.S. population because the new tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace the $2.4 trillion in income taxes paid by American households each year, she added.",
      "Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 or twice the current rate under Mr. Trump \u2014 the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "Why tariffs can't replace income taxes",
      "Even the notion of eliminating income taxes for people earning less than $200,000 doesn't add up, York said. Here's why: Mr. Trump's tariffs could raise about $170 billion in revenue this year, whlile wiping out individual taxes for people earning less than $200,000 would forego $700 billion in tax revenue this year, she estimated.",
      "\"You would need tariffs multiple times higher than what we have now\" to generate the revenue to make up for the gap in lost taxes, York said. Making the math work is \"an impossibility,\" she added.",
      "Yet hiking taxes even more aggressively would heighten the risks of a U.S. recession, which would cause job losses, inhibit consumer spending, suppress business investment and further roil financial markets \u2014 all developments that reduce the government's tax receipts.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim about tariffs lowering taxes amounts to \"an argument that says, 'If Americans pay more out of their left pocket, the government will be able to put more in their right pocket',\" said Joe Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, another think tank focused on taxes.",
      "\"Even if you make the math work, it's really replacing one form of tax with another \u2014 and the other important point here is these taxes have very different distributional effects across income types,\" he added.",
      "Translation: Tariffs take a bigger bite out of low- and middle-income Americans' budgets because they spend a larger share of their incomes on basics like food and household goods than compared with high-income Americans. A typical low-income household is likely to see their disposable income fall by 5.5% under Mr. Trump's tariffs, compared with 1.9% for the highest-earning families, according to a March 31\u00a0estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "But faced with higher prices for consumer goods, many households would cut back on spending, adding to the challenges of relying on tariffs to raise enough revenue to replace income taxes, experts say.",
      "Dueling goals",
      "Mr. Trump's move lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1943\u00a0reflects conflicting aims, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For instance, the president has said he wants to use tariffs to secure better trade deals with other nations. Yet reaching new trade pacts with lower tariff rates would undercut the president's goal of relying on import duties to replace the federal income tax.",
      "Mr. Trump's back-and forth on his tariffs, including temporarily rolling back some import fees and creating exclusions for certain products, also undermines the administration's ability to generate a new source of federal revenue, Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "\"If you are tariffs on, tariffs off, because of these negotiations that are supposedly going on, you're not raising much revenue, or protecting industry or getting new investment the United States because of all the uncertainty,\" Lincicome said.",
      "By dangling the prospect of a tax cut, Mr. Trump may be seeking to convince Americans to bear the brunt of the tariffs' impact, which economists say could slow U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"Americans are about to find out really fast that this is a tax on us,\" York noted. \"It will hurt our trading partners, too, but it is a tax that in large part falls on American businesses and American workers.\"",

      "U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies.",
      "The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of products and services \u2014 shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday in its initial GDP estimate. It's the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022, when the economy was in recovery after cratering during the COVID pandemic.",
      "The U.S. economy was forecast to show 0.8% growth in the first three months of 2025, according to the average estimate of economists polled by FactSet.",
      "The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S.\u00a0slipping into a recession in 2025. Although the Trump administration's blanket tariffs were announced on April 2 \u2014 after the end of the quarter \u2014 businesses sought to get ahead of the impact of the import duties by front-loading purchases early in the year.",
      "The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note.",
      "Nevertheless, concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior at year start, signaling that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025, experts said.",
      "\"This artificial front-loading of demand sets the stage for a sharper demand cliff in Q2 \u2014 a far more troubling phase of the ongoing economic slowdown.\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",

      "Another key measure of the economy's health \u2014 known as final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 also rose 3% in the first quarter, edging up from 2.9% in the previous three months. That suggests demand from consumers and businesses remains resilient despite mounting concerns about the economy.",
      "\"Overall, [the GDP data is] not as bad as feared, although some of the drop back in imports in the second quarter will now be partly offset by a slowing in inventory accumulation,\" analysts with the investment advisory firm said in a report. \"We forecast a 2.0% annualized rebound in second-quarter GDP.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, has effectively shuttered major agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and canceled funding for health and science research.",
      "Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies like Walmart or Target. When faced with higher tariffs, companies typically pass on all or some of the costs to shoppers, which can depress consumer spending.",
      "GDP growth is forecast to slow to 1.9% in 2025, according to FactSet. That's down from 2.8% in 2024.",
      "\"[T]he inflation data will show when the price increases of tariffs hit consumers, which will deliver a real income shock that we expect to weigh heavily on spending growth,\" Pearce said.",
      "A miss on ADP employment numbers",
      "Another red flag for the U.S. economy came on Wednesday with the release of ADP's employment numbers for April, which showed private employers added 62,000 jobs this month, far fewer than the 134,000 jobs that had been forecast by economists, according to FactSet.",
      "The monthly jobs report on Friday is expected to show that employers created 135,000 new jobs, a slowdown from 228,000 in March, FactSet data shows.",

    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent more than $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found for spending through April 29. We will be tracking and updating the spending throughout the year.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "\"If the savings are rather small and the pain is high, DOGE is going to be a liability,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been tracking DOGE's work.",
      "\"If you really want to cut federal spending, you're going to have to cut into the programs where the lion's share of the money is. That's Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and we spend a lot of money on interest,\" Malkus said.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories.",
      "Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The fiscal year ends September 30. There's still a lot more year left so let's see where we are at the end of the year,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "In his work at the American Enterprise Institute, Malkus said his review indicates the savings is more likely to be around $80 billion.",
      "Even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far by DOGE would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent more than $200 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",

You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the shelves are going to be open.' Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of which we don't need.\"",
      "U.S. imports of goods made in China expand far beyond toys to include electronics, clothes, household goods, appliances, construction materials and more. The president has said he believes tariffs on Chinese goods will ultimately be substantially lower than 145%.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came hours after the Commerce Department reported U.S. domestic gross product shrank at an 0.3% annual rate in the first quarter of 2025, down from growth of 2.4% at the end of 2024. It was the country's worst quarterly performance since early 2022. Despite taking credit for a strong stock market after his election victory and inauguration, Mr. Trump on Wednesday insisted the new economic numbers had nothing to do with him, and were the fault of his predecessor.",
      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" the president wrote Wednesday on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I didn't take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, the president took that statement a step further, telling reporters, \"You could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dismissed the possibility of higher prices stemming from tariffs before. Last month, he told NBC News in a phone interview that he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raised prices as a result of his new tariffs. This week, the president took executive actions to soften the impact\u00a0of the 25% tariffs he's imposing on foreign cars and foreign auto parts.",

      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Apr 2025 10:09:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The drop-off in shipments could lead to empty store shelves this summer as retailers deem China-made goods too expensive to import.",
    "story": [
      "Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply with the Trump administration's steep tariffs in place, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.",
      "The trade war between China and the U.S. has escalated over the past few weeks, with each nation hiking its import duties multiple times in a tit-for-tat. While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China has remained the exception.",
      "U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%. China, meanwhile, has hit back with 125% tariffs on U.S. products.",
      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company. Bookings from other Asia ports, such as Vietnam and Thailand, are up 5% to 10% as some exporters look to expand production outside of China to avoid steep tariffs.",
      "The decline in bookings from China comes during what is usually a busy period for imports to the U.S.",
      "\"We would normally see an increase in bookings across the board, because this is the beginning of the shipping year,\" said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. \"It's when back-to-school items and Halloween items start to come in.\"",
      "What's more, retailers have likely stockpiled sufficient inventory to last a couple of months, Seroka said, adding that come summer, consumers could find that many products are out of stock. All manner of goods flow through the Port of Los Angeles to end up in households across the U.S.",
      "The port's top five import categories are furniture, auto parts, clothing, plastics and footwear, a port spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Empty shelves?",
      "Major retailers and small establishments alike are warning that consumers could soon face tariff-related inventory shortages. Goods that do land on store shelves could be subject to price hikes, once \"tariff surcharges\" are added.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chef economist at private equity firm Apollo Global Management, said in a recent blog post that tariffs will lead to \"empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks and COVID-like shortages for consumers and for firms using Chinese products as intermediate goods.\"",
      "Last week, the CEOs of Walmart and Target privately cautioned\u00a0President Trump that his sweeping tariff policy could lead to gaps on store shelves, if it remains in effect,\u00a0Axios first reported.",
      "\"We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,\" Walmart\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Target also said in a statement that it \"had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "Both retailers had previously publicly warned that the levies could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey\u00a0told CNBC.",
      "Last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell\u00a0told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" as a result of tariffs planned on imports from Mexico.",
      "Widespread booking freeze",
      "Logistics groups are also reporting sharp declines in cargo shipments from China.",
      "For the week of April 14, booking volumes from China to the U.S. dropped 45% compared with the same period one year earlier, according to Vizion, a container tracking service.",
      "\"This dramatic drop aligned with two key developments: the April 4th U.S. tariff announcement, followed by China's retaliatory measures announced on April 5th. The result? A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",
      "Freightos, a freight booking platform, notes that carriers are canceling sailings from China at a fast clip, because they can't fill their ships with goods. Ocean container prices have dropped from $8,100 in July 2024 for a standard 40-foot container, to roughly, $2,327, the group noted.",
      "Many importers are pausing shipments until they gain more clarity into Mr. Trump's tariff plans. A Freightos survey of 195 small importers found that 33% of businesses planned to pause shipments in response to the tariffs.",
      "Kristin Bear, owner of a U.S.-based lingerie company, Kilo Brava, is hoping Mr. Trump softens his stance on tariffs, so that she can continue to manufacture garments in China and import them to the U.S. She can't afford to import goods with 145% tariffs in place, and if they don't come down, \"we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "UPS on Tuesday announced it is planning to cut 20,000 jobs this year, part of a cost-cutting effort that's linked to the delivery giant's decision to deliver fewer packages from Amazon, its biggest customer.",
      "The shipping company, which operates in over 200 countries, currently has around 490,000 employees. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of its workforce. This follows an announcement from UPS last year that it would cut 12,000 positions.",
      "The move is part of the company's plan to consolidate UPS's facilities and workforce. Along with the job cuts, the company announced it will also close 73 of its buildings by the end of June 2025 and said that it may target additional buildings for closure.",
      "\"These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability,\" Brian Dykes, the chief financial officer of UPS said during an earnings call on Tuesday morning.",
      "In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said the cuts are in \"connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.\" The company, which announced $21.5 billion in revenue for this past quarter, expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan.",
      "According to Sean M. O'Brien, the Teamsters general president, UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under their current national master agreement.",
      "\"If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won't stand in its way,\" O'Brien said. \"But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.\"",
      "\"Strong\" relationship with Amazon",
      "The company in January\u00a0said it had reached an agreement with Amazon to decrease its delivery volume by more than 50% in the second half of 2026.",
      "\"The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability,\" a UPS spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Amazon said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the company has a \"strong working relationship\" with UPS and that it had actually offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company made the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments.",
      "\"Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" said Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson. \"We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\"",
      "UPS delivers millions of packages worldwide each year. Last year, the company delivered an average of 22.4 million parcels per day, or 5.7 billion for the entire year.",
      "UPS shares slipped 55 cents, or 0.6%, to $96.61 in afternoon trading.",
      "Trade risks rising",
      "In its\u00a0quarterly earnings statement, the company also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping new tariffs in recent months that have already began to impact the flow of goods in and out of the country, and around the world.",
      "UPS handles roughly 400,000 imported parcels each day, or roughly 2% of the packages they move on a daily basis. Still, the company could be impacted if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues.",
      "\"From a revenue perspective, last year, revenue on our China to U.S. trade lanes represented 11% of our total international revenue,\" said CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said during Tuesday's earning call. \"Our China to U.S. trade lines are our most profitable trade lines.\"",
      "UPS is keeping customers abreast of tariff developments on its\u00a0website. It has also introduced a\u00a0tool\u00a0called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs they will have to pay in duties, fees and taxes.",
      "Amazon is also coming under pressure over tariffs. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday accused the retailer of engaging in \"a hostile and political act\" after political news site Punchbowl reported\u00a0that Amazon plans to display tariff costs next to product prices.",

      "The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but automakers won't be subject to the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum. Reimbursements will also be given to automakers who have already paid the double tariffs, the administration said.",

    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has made a series of false or misleading statements about consumer prices, while shoppers are seeing some tariff-related cost hikes.",
    "story": [
      "In the last week, President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims that the prices of everyday items like gas and groceries have fallen since he took office \u2014 even as Americans are starting to face surcharges for some items as a result of his tariff hikes.",
      "While Mr. Trump touts his economic record in interviews with the press, he has claimed without evidence that consumers are seeing record low prices at their gas pumps and exaggerated the decline in crude oil prices since he took office. The president has also falsely stated that he has overseen a drop in grocery prices.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's false claim that gas hit $1.98 a gallon in some places",
      "Trump said April 22: \"I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon. Nobody thought they'd see that for years maybe.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that gas prices dropped to a low of $1.98 in a few states in April, hitting lows not seen since his first term. However, that is not true; on average, gas prices are around the same as when the president took office in January.",
      "Data from the Energy Information Administration shows a national average of about $3.14 per gallon of regular gas as of the third week in April \u2014 which is slightly higher than the $3.11 the week Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "GasBuddy, a company that tracks prices at more than 150,000 gas stations across the country, told CBS News it had not found evidence of a gas station selling gas for $1.98 per gallon in April.",
      "Patrick De Haan, who leads petroleum analysis with the company, said the lowest price they could find in April was $2.19 at a gas station in Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim that gas prices are at their lowest level since his first term is also not true; gas prices were lower than they are now for the first six months of Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for more information on the president's claim.",
      "Trump's partially true claim that crude oil prices have dropped significantly since he took office",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel. When I came in\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and we were looking at $89, $90, $95.\"",
      "The president also claimed crude oil prices dropped to about $64 a barrel, from around $89 when he took office.",
      "A White House spokesman said the president was referring to the price per barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark. According to data from FactSet, Mr. Trump accurately described the current price of Brent crude, which was about $64 a barrel on April 28, but he also exaggerated the price at the time he assumed office, which was about $80. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.",
      "According to a recent Energy Information Administration report, Mr. Trump's tariff hikes in early April contributed to declines in oil prices as traders weighed the potential impact on global demand. An early April announcement that OPEC members\u00a0would increase oil production ahead of schedule also added to the downward pressure on prices.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that the price of groceries came down since he took office",
      "Trump said April 24: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump said April 17: \"Food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices have declined since he took office. However, Consumer Price Index data shows average cost of groceries in March increased by 0.49% from the previous month and by 2.4% compared to the previous year.",
      "Prices vary across products, and the White House said the president was referring to declines in the consumer prices of certain grocery store items like fresh vegetables. The USDA's Food Price Outlook shows that fresh vegetable prices decreased 1.1% in March, after falling by 1.7% in February. However, the same report also shows the prices of beef, poultry, eggs, and nonalcoholic beverages all ticked up in March.",
      "These increases occurred before the president imposed a baseline 10% tariff on goods from most countries in early April as well as tariffs as high as 145% on imports from China. Economists expect the prices of some grocery store items, including coffee and chocolate, will rise as a result, which could be reflected when data for April is released in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump's false claim that egg prices have gone down 87%",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs, and the price was down 87% so we did a great job.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that egg prices are down significantly, without clarifying whether he is referring to wholesale or consumer prices. The president has a point that wholesale prices have declined since he took office, but he overstates the size of the decline. And recent data suggests consumer prices remain elevated.",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 what large buyers such as Costco or Walmart pay producers \u2014 have dropped sharply since mid-March as egg losses due to bird flu decreased last month. U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows wholesale egg prices were roughly 52% lower on April 25 than they were at the start of Mr. Trump's second term. The White House did not explain the discrepancy in the president's figures.",
      "Meanwhile, retail prices for consumers remain at record highs. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on April 10 shows average retail egg prices hit $6.23 per dozen in March, surpassing the previous record $5.90 set in February.",
      "A March 28 report from the Department of Agriculture said it can take \"up to three weeks\" for consumers to benefit from the wholesale price decline. If retail prices show consistent decline, this should be reflected in the national average from BLS for April, said Jeremy Horpedahl, an associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. That data should become available on May 13.",

    "story": [
      "During his campaign last year, President Trump repeatedly attacked former President Joe Biden for his handling of the economy, vowing to boost economic growth and\u00a0lower inflation. But 100 days into his second term in the White House, the president is struggling to deliver on those promises.",
      "Mr. Trump's signature policies on trade, immigration and government spending have not only failed to spark economic growth \u2014 they're contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to re-ignite inflation, data shows. Economists also\u00a0warn that the chances of a U.S. recession\u00a0are rising.",
      "For millions of employers around the country, the Trump administration's helter-skelter approach to imposing tariffs on key trading partners, along with just about every other country on the planet,\u00a0has been challenging, corporate executives and small business owners have told CBS News.",
      "\"I can't think of a precedent for anything like this,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch of the impact of Mr. Trump's first 100 days on the economy.",
      "\"President Reagan, for instance, implemented a lot of changes in terms of tax policy and defense spending and cuts, and those things had big impacts,\" she added, \"but the element here that's quite different is the approach, which has been quite inconsistent and chaotic.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's loyal base of supporters continues to voice support, among other voters there's also a widespread and growing belief that the administration is too focused on\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and not focused enough on lowering prices, according to CBS News polling about the president's first 100 days in office.",
      "Such concerns come as the White House makes a sharp break with the country's traditional playbook on global trade. The result, say critics, includes the highest tariffs in more than a century; sudden, confusing\u00a0shifts in tariff policy\u00a0and major damage to the U.S.' geopolitical relationships.",
      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",
      "The Trump administration stands by its economic record to date, with White House spokesman Kush Deai saying in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that \"President Trump's America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\"",
      "\"Within 100 days of President Trump's second term in office, Americans saw the first monthly price drop in years in the March inflation report, while industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to Nvidia have made trillions in historic investment commitments to reshore manufacturing back to the United States,\" Desai added. \"President Trump delivered a historic economy in his first term, and he's running back the success in his second term.\"",
      "Economic slowdown",
      "Already, the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing. Business surveys in April suggest the U.S. is headed for \"a sluggish pace of growth,\" according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, which pointed to what it calls an \"an existential crisis\" for businesses, created by Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total annual value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 is forecast to slow to 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, a sharp decline from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to economists polled by financial services firm FactSet. For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-college-worth-the-money-heres-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had an annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014 a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2014 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2014 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages of their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Avelo Airlines says it's counting on a new federal contract for deportation flights to help the discount carrier grow its regular passenger service.",
    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",

Goldberg\u00a0published\u00a0his account, and he initially omitted operational details, but after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied any classified information had been shared on the chat, Goldberg published that information, too, which included the timing of the strikes and the weapons packages used.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, but Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump did not ask him to step down at the time. Publicly, President Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "One source familiar with the situation at the National Security Council said the president thinks sufficient time has passed since the Signal incident that Waltz and Wong's departures can be framed as part of a reorganization.

      "Washington \u2014 Chris Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during President Trump's first term, has had his membership in the Global Entry traveler program revoked, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Thursday.",
      "The move comes after Mr. Trump issued a memorandum last month that targeted Krebs for defending the integrity of the 2020 election, which the president has continued to baselessly claim was rigged against him. The directive instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to suspend security clearances held by Krebs and people working at entities associated with him, including at the cybersecurity company where he worked.",
      "Krebs, a CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst,\u00a0told the Wall Street Journal last month that he was resigning from that company, SentinelOne.",
      "Mr. Trump's memo also directed his administration to investigate Krebs' activities from his time in the federal government, including at CISA.",

      "Global Entry is a program run by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection that allows expedited clearance for travelers arriving in the U.S. who are pre-approved and low-risk. A person may not be eligible for the Global Entry program if they are the subject of an ongoing federal, state or local law enforcement agency, according to CBP.",
      "Krebs was fired by Mr. Trump in 2020 after he refuted the president's unsupported claims that the election was rife was widespread voter fraud. CISA had released a joint statement days after the Nov. 3, 2020, election saying that it was the \"most secure in American history\" and that there was \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\"",
      "In announcing his decision to remove Krebs from his role as CISA director, Mr. Trump claimed the statement was \"highly inaccurate.\" While the president and his campaign mounted dozens of lawsuits challenging the integrity of the 2020 election, none were successful and claims of widespread fraud were refuted, including by Mr. Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has continued to claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him and has undertaken numerous actions to take revenge against his political adversaries and critics now that he is back in the White House.

      "Harris gave the keynote address at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that assists Democratic women in running for office.",
      "In her speech, which comes on the heels of\u00a0Mr. Trump's 100th day in office, Harris took aim at her former opponent, saying that \"instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals.\"",
      "Harris said that the Trump administration and his allies are \"counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others.\"",
      "Harris called Mr. Trump's trade war the \"greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history,\" describing the president's tariffs as \"reckless.\"",
      "Harris said the tariffs instituted by the Trump administration have \"hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials\" and are paralyzing \"American businesses, large and small, forcing them to lay off people, to stop hiring or pause investment decisions.\"",
      "She later added that \"the tariffs, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.\"",
      "\"But please, let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. It may feel like that,\" Harris said. \"But understand: What we are, in fact, witnessing is a high velocity event, where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.\"",
      "Harris also touched on Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, saying \"it is not OK to detain or disappear American citizens without due process.\"",
      "The Trump administration has faced ongoing controversy over the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security last week also sent a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras with her mother, who is undocumented.",
      "The former vice president praised \"the courage of judges to uphold the rule of law in the face of those who would jail them,\" a reference to the federal arrest of a Wisconsin judge last week accused of obstructing immigration agents.",
      "Harris ended her speech by acknowledging that \"things are going to get worse before they get better,\" but called on Americans to \"stand together\" and \"gear up for the hard work ahead.\"",
      "\"Always remember: This country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to we the people.\"",
      "The former vice president focused her speech on criticizing the Trump administration, stopping short of announcing a run for California governor or any other office.",
      "With Gov. Gavin Newsom terming out of the governor's office in 2026, Harris' name has been floated as a possible candidate to become California's next chief executive. Some polling has shown Harris garnering strong support for a run.",
      "Harris has mostly kept a lower profile since the election. She was in attendance at Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "Earlier in April, Harris attended the Leading Women Defined Summit event and gave a talk that possibly hinted at some of the themes she may expand on in Wednesday's speech.",

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

      "Ukrainian and U.S. officials have signed a joint economic investment deal that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earths minerals, the Treasury Department\u00a0announced Wednesday.",
      "A Treasury Department press release said the two countries have agreed to establish a \"United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund,\" referring to it as an \"economic partnership.\" The statement did not include more detail about the agreement.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, confirmed that she signed the deal. In a series of posts on X written in Ukrainian, she described it as a 50/50 partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. She said the deal would be funded through direct investment, future U.S. aid and revenue from new mineral licensing deals \u2014 and does not set up any Ukrainian debt obligations.",
      "According to a Ukrainian fact sheet, the U.S. would contribute to the fund \"either through direct financial input or through new military assistance,\" and the agreement \"focuses on further, not past U.S. military assistance.\" Ukraine would contribute 50% of any royalties from future \u2014 but not existing \u2014 oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine would hold onto ownership of its natural resources, and the fund can only be invested in resource and infrastructure projects within Ukraine. Profits from the fund would be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, and can be \"distributed between the partners\" after that, the fact sheet also said.",
      "An official at the Development Finance Corporation \u2014 a U.S. government agency helping to oversee the deal \u2014 said the joint fund will \"make strategic investments in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, natural resources, and natural resources-related infrastructure in Ukraine, which will help diversify and secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security.\"",
      "The fund will also \"select vital critical minerals to the United States for offtake,\" the official said.",
      "President Trump had\u00a0pressed\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about an economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's minerals, framing it as a way of paying the U.S. back for aiding the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia. Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's reserves of rare earth elements, which are used in electronics, defense technology and energy projects. Some of the country's reserves are located in parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in an interview with NewsNation late Wednesday. \"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have,\" Trump said, of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves.",
      "Zelenskyy initially traveled to Washington in February to sign a mineral deal with Mr. Trump. Those plans were\u00a0derailed\u00a0after an explosive Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance. During the meeting, Vance accused Zelenskyy of being\u00a0insufficiently grateful\u00a0for U.S. military aid.",
      "Negotiations continued despite the public acrimony. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting the U.S. was prepared to sign a deal, but Ukraine had requested \"last minute changes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has cast the mineral deal as a key part of his broader gambit to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.",
      "Those talks have proven rocky: At least twice in recent weeks, Trump administration officials have threatened to pull out of negotiations unless more progress is made. Mr. Trump has lashed out at Zelenskyy repeatedly, calling him a \"dictator\" earlier this year and accusing him last week of prolonging the war by refusing to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. The two leaders held a private meeting Saturday in the Vatican while attending the funeral of Pope Francis.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has threatened to tighten sanctions on Russia unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a deal. Russia launched deadly strikes last week on Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv, angering Mr. Trump, who posted \"Vladimir, STOP!\" on Truth Social.",

    "story": [
      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student who had been detained by immigration authorities when he went to his U.S. citizenship interview, has been released after a federal judge's order in Vermont on Wednesday.",
      "Mahdawi, who has a\u00a0green card, was taken into custody on April 16. His immigration case remains open, and there will be another hearing on Thursday.",
      "\"Yes you might think I am free, but my freedom is interlinked with the freedom of many other students,\" Mahdawi said outside the courthouse in Burlington, Vermont, shortly after being released.",
      "A judge later issued an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "The Justice Department said Wednesday that it would appeal the court order that led to Mahdawi's release from federal immigration custody.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys argued that the Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahdawi because he helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia University's campus in the early months of the Israel-Hamas war, in violation of his First Amendment rights.",
      "Judge Geoffrey Crawford said Wednesday that Mahdawi had \"made substantial claims that his detention is the result of retaliation for protected speech.\"",
      "Crawford said that this is not the first time the U.S. has seen chilling efforts by the government that are \"intended to shut down debate,\" comparing it to the Red Scare and McCarthyism in the 1950s. He said those were times when immigration laws were used to curb speech.",
      "Michael Drescher, the U.S. attorney for Vermont, had previously argued for Mahdawi's detention, saying in court documents that detention is a \"constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\" and district courts \"play no role in the process.\"",
      "The government argued that he could be detained under the Immigration and Nationality Act, saying in court documents that Mahdawi is removable because \"[t]he Secretary of State has determined that your presence and activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "That provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act has been cited by the State Department and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to\u00a0revoke visas\u00a0of students who took part in pro-Palestinian protests at universities. In March, Rubio said 300 visas had been revoked, saying \"I do it every day.\"",
      "\"Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" Rubio said.",
      "The State Department has alleged the \"foreign policy consequences\" relate to antisemitism.",
      "Mahdawi has pushed back against allegations of antisemitism in the Columbia protests. In an interview with CBS News a day before his arrest, Mahdawi said, \"I want people to know that my compassion extended beyond the Palestinian people. My compassion is also for the Jewish people and for the Israelis as well.\"",
      "He also said he took a step back from the protests before students formed encampments on Columbia's campus and took over a school building last year.",

    "story": [
      "The wife of a 29-year-old Maryland man who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador last month filed a protective order against him back in 2021 over allegations of domestic violence, according to court records obtained by CBS News.",
      "Jennifer Vasquez sought and received a temporary protective order in civil court against Kilmar Abrego Garcia in May 2021, per court records filed in Prince George's County District Court. The order alleges Abrego Garcia \"punched and scratched\" Vasquez, \"ripped off\" her shirt and \"grabbed and bruised\" her \u2014 though she has since said she didn't move forward with the court process because the situation \"did not escalate.\"",
      "In a court petition, Vasquez describes multiple incidents over the course of several days in May 2021. In one case, Vasquez wrote that Abrego Garcia got angry with her at a gas station, insulted her and drove very fast. Days later, Vasquez alleges Abrego Garcia yelled at her to turn off her laptop, and when she said she wasn't tired, she said he \"got angry\" and threw her laptop on the floor. She alleged she pushed him off of her, and \"he then punched\" and \"[scratched] me on my left eye, leaving me bleeding.\"",
      "Later that day, Abrego Garcia allegedly tore off Vasquez's shorts and shirt and \"grabbed me by the arm\" when she ran away, leaving a mark on her left arm. The following morning, after he allegedly didn't give her a set of car keys, she called an Uber for her and the kids because she was \"scared of him\" and \"afraid to be close to him.\"",
      "\"I have multiple photos/videos of how [violent] he can be and all the bruises he has left me,\" Vasquez wrote in the petition.",
      "At the time, the judge in the case ordered Abrego Garcia not to contact Vasquez, and to vacate their home and stay away from the home of another family member. He was also ordered to surrender firearms.",
      "The case, however, was dismissed in June 2021 after Vasquez failed to appear for a final hearing, according to court records. The two returned to living together.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team responded to Vasquez's protective order after the Department of Homeland Security posted it on X Wednesday, noting he hasn't been criminally convicted.",
      "\"If the government believes there is a legitimate case to be made, it should present that case in a court of law and have a judge review and decide his fate\u2014not on social media,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote. \"But that cannot happen until Mr. Abrego Garcia is returned to the United States and given full due process. These allegations, without more, prove why due process and access to counsel is so important.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday evening, Vasquez confirmed seeking the court order.",
      "\"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\" Vasquez said. \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",
      "Court records show Vasquez sought and obtained a separate temporary protective order in August 2020, also alleging domestic violence.",
      "According to the Department of Homeland Security, Vasquez also sought a protective order against Abrego Garcia in 2020, accusing him of verbally abusing her, kicking and slapping her. She said when police arrived at their home, he became more violent, breaking her phone in front of an officer. She also stated that there had been other incidents in 2019 and 2020 when he became violent and broke electronic devices and doors in the house.",
      "Criminal charges were never filed for the 2020 allegations.",
      "Vasquez is a U.S. citizen and Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran national.",
      "The Trump administration has admitted that an \"administrative error\" led to Abrego Garcia's deportation on March 15, but has claimed Abrego Garcia is \"not a sympathetic figure,\" sharing Vasquez's protective order on X Wednesday.",
      "The case has prompted a string of legal wrangling that made its way to the Supreme Court, which last week upheld a lower court decision that the Trump administration be required to \"facilitate\" his release.",
      "Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, the case has appeared to languish. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has repeatedly rebuked the Trump administration for stonewalling her and not complying with her order to both provide information on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia was among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadoran migrants that were placed aboard three March 15 deportation flights to El Salvador after the White House alleged, often without evidence, that the men are members of transnational gangs.",
      "President Trump invoked the wartime 1798 Alien Enemies Act as justification for deporting many of the migrants to El Salvador. Another federal judge who had ordered the three flights to El Salvador be turned around found Wednesday that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying his orders.",
      "The men are reportedly being held in the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison, known as CECOT, under an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "During a White House meeting with Mr. Trump Monday, Bukele told reporters he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that same day it is \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old.",
      "In 2019, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but an immigration judge barred his removal from the U.S. after determining that he could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. The judge granted him what is known as \"withholding of removal\" status.",
      "He was arrested again on March 12 following a traffic stop. Citing information from an informant who officials have said is credible, the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his family and attorneys deny. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador, according to government documents.",

      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent more than $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found for spending through April 29. We will be tracking and updating the spending throughout the year.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "\"If the savings are rather small and the pain is high, DOGE is going to be a liability,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been tracking DOGE's work.",
      "\"If you really want to cut federal spending, you're going to have to cut into the programs where the lion's share of the money is. That's Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and we spend a lot of money on interest,\" Malkus said.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories.",
      "Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The fiscal year ends September 30. There's still a lot more year left so let's see where we are at the end of the year,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "In his work at the American Enterprise Institute, Malkus said his review indicates the savings is more likely to be around $80 billion.",
      "Even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far by DOGE would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent more than $200 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",

      "Mr. Trump's remarks came hours after the Commerce Department reported U.S. domestic gross product shrank at an 0.3% annual rate in the first quarter of 2025, down from growth of 2.4% at the end of 2024. It was the country's worst quarterly performance since early 2022. Despite taking credit for a strong stock market after his election victory and inauguration, Mr. Trump on Wednesday insisted the new economic numbers had nothing to do with him, and were the fault of his predecessor.",
      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" the president wrote Wednesday on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I didn't take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, the president took that statement a step further, telling reporters, \"You could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dismissed the possibility of higher prices stemming from tariffs before. Last month, he told NBC News in a phone interview that he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raised prices as a result of his new tariffs. This week, the president took executive actions to soften the impact\u00a0of the 25% tariffs he's imposing on foreign cars and foreign auto parts.",
      "A recent CBS News/YouGov poll\u00a0found most Americans \u2014 69% \u2014 say the Trump administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, and 62% say he's focusing too much on implementing tariffs.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 22:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wants the congressional watchdog agency to examine what the FBI spent on Patel's personal travel.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review the FBI Director Kash Patel's personal travel on government aircraft, according to GAO and congressional sources.",
      "The review will examine Patel's use of the FBI's private fleet of jets, as well as every director's approach since 2013, when the GAO last studied the issue. Investigators at the congressional watchdog agency are expected to examine Patel's flight records to determine the purpose of his travel, how much the bureau spent and whether Patel reimbursed the government for personal trips.",
      "Last week, both CBS News and The New York Times reported on questions swirling within the FBI about the degree to which Patel has used government aircraft for purely personal reasons, including trips to visit his girlfriend and attend hockey games and other sporting events.",
      "Asked about the inquiry, the FBI declined to comment.",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency. They must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",
      "The FBI wouldn't share Patel's flight schedule, citing security concerns, and officials declined to confirm his presence on a number of flights to destinations that matched his appearances in those same places. During the first week of April, for example, a Boeing 757 leased by the Justice Department made two round-trip flights to New York.",
      "On April 5, the narrow-bodied jet took a 57-minute flight to Stewart International Airport, a short drive from West Point, where Patel participated in a charity hockey game hosted by the FBI. The next day, the 757 was back in the air to JFK Airport, landing just hours before Patel showed up in box seats next to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to watch Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin break the NHL scoring record.",
      "Patel also has apparently made use of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets to travel to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by public flight trackers, including a weekend jaunt to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 24.",
      "On some occasions, Patel appeared to travel for both business and pleasure. An FBI jet flew on March 21 from Washington, D.C., to Nashville. That day, Patel participated in a roundtable meeting with state and local law enforcement there, and also visited the FBI field office. The plane returned to Washington later that afternoon. It is unclear whether Patel also visited his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins.",
      "In a statement to CBS News after Patel's travel patterns became public last week, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \"the Judiciary Committee must investigate Director Patel's apparent misuse of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, did not respond to a question about whether the committee would probe Patel's use of FBI planes for personal travel.",
      "It is at the director's discretion how often to use government aircraft for personal travel and for what specific purposes. In 2013, the GAO last investigated the use of FBI planes for \"non-mission\" purposes and laid out a detailed accounting of how often the aircraft were being used by the director as well as the attorney general, who also has access to the planes. While the probe found little wrongdoing, the report cautioned against excessive use of the planes for personal travel.",
      "Diana Maurer, a director at GAO and author of the 2013 report, told CBS News that the same principles that were at play when the government watchdog agency did its review, remain relevant today.",
      "\"I don't know what the current FBI director did or didn't do,\" Mauer said in an interview. \"But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't mean you necessarily should.\"",
      "She pointed out that operating government aircraft costs considerably more than commercial flights and that officials shouldn't abuse their privileges at the expense of taxpayers.",
      "\"I hope the FBI and the Department of Justice are considering the implications for taxpayers when the director uses government aircraft for non-mission purposes,\" Maurer said in the interview.",
      "Use of the FBI's aircraft for personal travel has been a flashpoint between Congress and the bureau in recent years. When Christopher Wray, Patel's predecessor, ran the FBI, his personal use of the executive jets became a focus of Republicans on Capitol Hill and conservative critics.",
      "Wray was hit for flying back and forth from Washington to his hometown of Atlanta, where his family maintained its residence. (Wray rejected the criticism at the time, noting that he was a \"required-use traveler,\" and that he reimbursed the government in every instance he used the planes for personal purposes.)",
      "Wray also drew criticism from GOP lawmakers and from some former FBI agents for summoning the G5s to Reagan National Airport from Manassas, a 15-mile flight, rather than being driven 30 miles to the Virginia airport where the FBI maintains a hangar.",
      "Patel himself was a vocal critic of Wray's use of FBI aircraft for personal travel. Two years ago, on his podcast \"Kash's Corner,\" he admonished the FBI to \"ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country.\" Now that he has replaced Wray at the top of the FBI, he is staying mum about his own use of the bureau's fleet of private aircraft for personal use.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/100-days-of-doge-elon-musk-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk and DOGE amassed vast power in President Trump's administration \u2014 reshaping federal agencies and spearheading deep cuts to the federal workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump returned to office 100 days ago, Elon Musk has amassed vast power \u2014 leading the administration's efforts to shutter government agencies and slash the federal workforce.",
      "Musk's ruthless approach to leading the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 epitomized by a speech in which the Tesla CEO brandished a chainsaw \u2014 has drawn lawsuits, pushback from federal workers and criticism from Tesla investors. But he's also held onto broad support from Republican voters and, at least publicly, from Mr. Trump himself.",
      "Musk gained influence \u2014 and spent heavily \u2014 in 2024 race",
      "Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 endorsed Mr. Trump minutes after the then-presidential candidate's July 2024 assassination attempt. Musk had oscillated on backing Mr. Trump: The one-time Obama backer suggested Mr. Trump \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" in 2022, and later supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's 2024 GOP primary bid.",
      "The alliance between the two billionaires was defined by campaign cash. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Mr. Trump and other GOP candidates in 2024, much of it through Musk's America PAC. The group helped lead Mr. Trump's get-out-the-vote efforts, and became known for using its massive war chest in unorthodox and often controversial ways. One plan to dole out $1 million a day to swing state voters who signed a petition drew a lawsuit from Philadelphia's district attorney, who accused Musk's super PAC of running an illegal lottery.",
      "Mr. Trump floated a Musk-led \"government efficiency commission\" during the later months of the campaign. The scope of Musk's role was initially unclear: In a post-election statement, Mr. Trump framed DOGE as an external body that would offer \"advice and guidance,\" a far more limited role than the one Musk took on.",
      "Musk promises $2 trillion in cuts but slashes far less",
      "In an October campaign rally, the billionaire predicted he could find at least $2 trillion in annual savings, which would require him to slash the budget by nearly 30% \u2014 a daunting goal considering that almost half of all government spending goes toward the military, Medicare and Social Security, three politically difficult-to-cut areas. Earlier this year, Musk cited a still-ambitious $1 trillion as his target.",
      "So far, DOGE's stated cost savings haven't come close to the trillion-dollar mark. Musk said earlier this month he anticipates $150 billion in savings in the 2026 fiscal year by cutting waste and fraud. Meanwhile, the DOGE website says it has saved $160 billion through a combination of cancelling contracts and grants, selling assets and ferreting out fraud.",
      "But many of the cost savings touted by DOGE have been called into question. DOGE keeps a running tally of spending cuts on its website, but this \"wall of receipts\" has included errors and unverified claims, including an $8 million cancelled contract that was erroneously listed at $8 billion, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields defended DOGE's cost-cutting goals and called $1 trillion a year an achievable benchmark. He also said mistakes are rare and \"corrected immediately,\" and the statistics on DOGE's site go through a \"lengthy assessment and analysis.\" The $8 billion mistake dates back to the prior administration, DOGE has argued.",
      "\"The goal is to cut as much waste, fraud and abuse from the federal government as possible,\" Fields told CBS News. \"The president is very happy and supportive of the achievements of DOGE, and knows that we are just now getting started.\"",
      "Some of Musk's claims about the size of the government's fraud problem are also difficult to prove. He told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow last month the government could save $500 billion to $700 billion by cutting fraud and waste from entitlement programs, but there's little evidence that fraud exists on anywhere near that scale, which would equal 20% to 30% of all annual spending on Social Security and Medicare. The Government Accountability Office estimates the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion per year due to fraud. When asked about Musk's $700 billion fraud estimates, Fields said \"I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.\"",
      "And DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce could end up costing $135 billion due to paid leave and productivity costs, an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service estimates.",
      "That estimate was dismissed by the White House. \"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" Fields told CBS News last week.",
      "Thousands of federal workers cut since Trump and Musk's \"fork in the road\"",
      "When the Trump administration emailed millions of federal workers in January to offer months of pay in exchange for quitting their jobs, the message's subject line \u2014 \"Fork in the Road\" \u2014 was identical to the one Musk used to coax staff into leaving Twitter after he bought the site.",
      "Since then, Musk has played a central role in efforts to cut up to 10% of the civilian workforce.",
      "The White House says 75,000 people took the \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation deal, which offered to pay employees until the end of September if they resigned from their positions by early February. As many as 200,000 workers were expected to participate. Tens of thousands of federal employees have also been laid off, including large numbers of probationary workers with less than one or two years of service.",
      "The job cuts have hit across the federal government. DOGE staffers visited the Pentagon in February as the military plans to eliminate tens of thousands of civilian roles. The Social Security Administration has lost thousands of workers, and the Internal Revenue Service could cut its staff by 25% according to the Associated Press.",
      "Health agencies have been hit by the administration's cuts. The National Institutes of Health is expected to face steep budget cuts, a move former NIH Director Francis Collins warned could have dire consequences for public health in an interview with \"60 Minutes.\" The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has lost 10% of its staff, CBS News reported.",
      "Some 1,000 National Park Service workers were laid off, raising fears about understaffing.",
      "Fields told CBS News the Trump administration's job cuts are designed to avoid any disruption to critical government services, but added: \"To a bureaucracy that has gone untouched for decades, it's going to be disruptive.\"",
      "In some cases, laid-off probationary workers have been rehired due to now-paused court orders that halted the job cuts, causing confusion. \"We're supposed to be OK. But one minute we're in a good space, and the next minute we could just lose everything,\" one rehired Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff member told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk has publicly blasted the federal workforce, claiming DOGE is on a mission to eliminate a \"dictatorship of the bureaucracy\" that's hostile to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "In February, federal employees received an email with the subject line, \"What did you do last week?\" instructing them to reply with a list of five things they'd accomplished. Musk warned on X that any non-responses \"will be taken as a resignation.\" The move set off confusion, with some agencies telling workers not to respond. Musk later called the emails a \"pulse check\" designed to root out dead or nonexistent people that he claims are collecting paychecks.",
      "DOGE tries to shut down agencies: USAID, CFPB and more",
      "Even if DOGE's cuts could fall short of Musk's goals, its influence has been sweeping.",
      "Within days of Mr. Trump's inauguration, DOGE began touting canceled contracts, and its staff became embedded in scores of departments. Musk told Fox Business last month his team of over 100 people was in \"pretty much\" every agency. Many of the funding cuts have been abrupt, and Musk has admitted DOGE has made mistakes in its rapid push to slash spending.",
      "In some cases, Musk's team has participated in the near-dismantling of federal agencies. The gambit has often begun with DOGE staffers accessing an agency's offices \u2014 in some cases clashing with employees \u2014 followed by mass job cuts.",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, a foreign aid agency that Musk described as a \"criminal organization\" awash with fraud, was one of his earliest targets. Two USAID security officials were put on leave for trying to stop DOGE staffers from accessing internal systems (a Trump administration spokesperson said at the time classified information wasn't accessed without security clearances). The Trump administration later placed many of USAID's staff on leave, halted foreign aid programs and began absorbing what remained of USAID into the State Department.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also drawn Musk's ire. In early February, DOGE personnel entered the financial regulator's office and \"camped out in the basement,\" a former agency staffer told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Hours later, Musk posted on X, \"CFPB RIP.\" The administration has tried to lay off 90% of CFPB staff and halt the agency's work, though a federal judge has temporarily blocked those moves.",
      "DOGE's efforts at the U.S. Institute of Peace triggered a legal standoff, with several fired board members suing the administration and accusing DOGE personnel of engaging in a \"literal trespass and takeover by force\" at the agency's headquarters. The White House defended cuts to the organization at the time, telling CBS News, \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.\"",
      "Musk accesses federal data",
      "Personnel at DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's internal payment system in the first few weeks of Mr. Trump's term, which Musk cast as a way to catch fraud. The move prompted concern from Democrats due to the sensitive personal data handled by the system and the possibility that DOGE could try to cut off spending authorized by Congress. The Trump administration said at the time Musk's team has \"read-only\" access.",
      "In mid-February, a staffer linked to DOGE also sought access to the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer data system, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said the administration is planning a \"basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits.\"",
      "Musk has scrutinized the Social Security Administration, which he claims is rife with fraud, suggesting tens of millions of dead people are receiving payments and immigrants are abusing the system en masse, though he's never offered any evidence for either of these assertions. He's described Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" though both Musk and Mr. Trump have said they would not cut benefits. At one point earlier this year, the SSA considered requiring Social Security recipients to verify their identities in person instead of over the phone, but the agency reversed course after seniors and their advocates objected.",
      "Musk clashes with Democrats, courts \u2014 and even Trump allies",
      "Musk's rise to power has drawn outrage from Democrats, who argue DOGE has unilaterally slashed spending appropriated by Congress. Most Republican lawmakers defended DOGE, though some have raised concerns about sweeping cuts to public health agencies and programs important to their districts.",
      "Public opinion on Musk is similarly divided. Some 52% of Americans said in late February Musk and DOGE had too much influence over federal worker firing decisions, including 81% of Democrats and 57% of independents but just 21% of Republicans, according to a CBS News poll with a margin of error of 2.5 points.",
      "Musk has occasionally clashed with other Trump loyalists. His pick for interim IRS leader \u2014 Hunter Biden whistleblower Gary Shapley \u2014 left the role after just 48 hours, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent privately complained to Mr. Trump. And Musk publicly feuded with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over tariffs, calling him \"dumber than a sack of bricks.\"",
      "DOGE's aggressive moves have also drawn lawsuits arguing the agency has exceeded its authority. At various points, judges have halted DOGE's efforts to lay off workers and access the Treasury payment system, though in many cases, those rulings were stayed.",
      "Some legal challenges have zeroed in on Musk's official status in the administration. The White House says Musk is a \"special government employee,\" which allows him to serve for up to 130 days in a single yearlong period. The administration has argued in court papers that Musk isn't officially DOGE's administrator and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "DOGE clashes with Musk's business interests",
      "Musk's business empire benefits heavily from federal programs. Tesla sells billions of dollars a year in credits to automakers that fall short of federal emission rules, and its cars are subsidized by tax incentives for electric vehicles \u2014 though Mr. Trump has called for a rollback of electric car subsidies. Mr. Trump has also offered his public endorsement, promising to buy a Tesla in a White House event. Musk's aerospace company SpaceX has valuable contracts with NASA, and its satellite internet division Starlink could take over a contract to modernize the air traffic control system, The Associated Press reports.",
      "Musk has pushed back on conflict-of-interest concerns, saying in an Oval Office appearance with Mr. Trump, \"all of our actions are maximally transparent.\"",
      "But DOGE has caused agita for Tesla investors, some of whom fear Musk is too distracted to run the company or his polarizing image could hurt the carmaker's brand. The company's sales and profits have fallen over the past year, and its share price is down nearly 25% from early January, prompting some investors to urge him to step back from the Trump administration.",
      "Musk said on a Tesla earnings call last week that his \"time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly\" in May. But he added that he'll remain involved for the rest of Mr. Trump's term.",
      "There's no indication DOGE or Musk's work at the White House will end next month. \"Elon Musk will still be a common face here,\" Fields said.",

      "Two dozen states filed a lawsuit Tuesday over dramatic cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the Trump administration is trying to \"dismantle\" the volunteer service organization as part of its sweeping federal cost-cutting campaign.",
      "AmeriCorps has put 85% of its staff on administrative leave ahead of planned job cuts, the lawsuit says. The agency has also allegedly slashed its National Civilian Community Corps, which sends volunteers to work on conservation, natural disaster response and other projects, and cut hundreds of millions in grants, covering 41% of the agency's budget.",
      "The lawsuit argues the cuts \u2014 which it links to President Trump's federal cost-cutting push, led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers, since Congress created and funded AmeriCorps.",
      "\"If the Defendants' actions are permitted to stand despite their statutory and constitutional defects, then the gutting of AmeriCorps will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, their residents, and the public at large,\" reads the lawsuit, which was filed in Maryland federal court and led by California, Colorado, Delaware and Maryland.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: \"Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump has the legal right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch.\"",
      "AmeriCorps' inspector general said in November the agency \"has been unable to produce auditable financial statements for the last eight years,\" and recommended changes to the agency's financial practices.",
      "Founded in 1993, AmeriCorps oversees around 200,000 members, most of whom receive living stipends, and employs hundreds of people. It funds both directly operated programs, like the National Civilian Community Corps and grant-funded programs overseen by states.",

      "President Trump marked the first 100 days in office of his second term with a Tuesday evening\u00a0rally\u00a0outside Detroit \u2014 spending much of his 90-minute speech touting his administration's record on immigration and lashing out against judges, Biden-era officials and other foes.",
      "\"We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, and that's according to many, many people,\" Mr. Trump said to kick off his speech at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan. \"This is the best, they say, 100-day start of any president in history, and everyone is saying it. We've just gotten started. You haven't even seen anything yet.\"",
      "The president chose to give his speech in the heart of the auto industry, as he hopes the tariffs he's imposing on imports from other countries will bring auto companies and other manufacturers back to the U.S., despite economists' warnings that the president's policies will increase prices. On Tuesday, the president signed executive orders to provide some relief from the 25% tariffs he's imposing on imported foreign cars and parts.",
      "As the president's approval numbers have slipped since his inauguration, Mr. Trump particularly homed in on his administration's border enforcement policies. Immigration continues to be one of the president's strongest issues in polling.",

      "\"We tried to get it higher, we tried to get it higher, but the courts are giving us a hard time, can you believe?\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, I won on the basis of, I think, the number one thing was on illegal immigration, the border. \u2026 I think that was the number one thing, and now the courts are trying to say that you know, that doesn't matter. I don't think it's going to be allowed to stand.\"",
      "\"I hope for the sake of our country that the Supreme Court is going to save this,\" Mr. Trump said later.",

      "\"Now, we're respected all over the world,\" he said. \"They're coming from all over the world to see your president. They're coming from India, they're coming from France, they're coming from Spain. Yeah, they're coming from China, too, yeah, they're coming from China. They're coming from all over to see your president. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. And you know, we'll make deals, but we don't have to.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also touted slower inflation, but criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying he's \"not really doing a good job.\" The Fed has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for declining to speed up interest rate cuts so far this year, which could boost economic growth at the cost of higher inflation. Powell has also warned Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push up consumer prices and harm the economy.",
      "The president also touted his administration's work to slash government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. He also mentioned his administration's instruction to federal employees to return to the office, saying some federal workers improved their golf handicap while working remotely.",
      "\"They weren't working at home. Who the hell would work at home? How do you work at home?\" he said.",
      "The president called multiple aides on stage, including special assistant to the president Margo Martin. \"Trump 2028, anybody?\" she said, to cheers from the crowd. Mr. Trump has periodically floated seeking a third term \u2014 and his online store sells \"Trump 2028\" merchandise \u2014 though the Constitution only allows presidents to be elected to two terms.",
      "Mr. Trump also touted his administration's work on hot-button social issues.",
      "\"I ended all of the lawless so-called diversity, equity and inclusion bulls***, all across the federal government and the private sector,\" the president claimed. \"And I made it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. And the really easy one, this was the easiest one I had, I banned men from competing in women's sports.\"",
      "The president doesn't have the authority to do all those things in the private sector and at the local level, but the administration has sought to influence those spheres.",
      "As Republicans struggle to figure out how to pay for the president's tax cuts, making cuts to Medicaid has been a possible pay-for. But the president insisted he'll protect Medicaid.",
      "\"We will always protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors, with no cuts, and we will defend Medicaid for those great people that are in need,\" Mr. Trump said as he neared the end of his speech. \"House Republicans are working to invest more money in Medicaid than we spend today. The only thing we're going to cut is the corruption and the crooks that take advantage of some of the illegal schemes. So we want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable, for our kids, pregnant women, the poor and disabled Americans.\"",
      "What to know about Trump's first 100 days",
      "In his Michigan speech, Mr. Trump hit many of the highlights of his second term so far, including mass deportation operations, efforts to shrink the size and scope of government and the changes he's making to the global trade landscape. Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs are unlawful.",
      "\"[I]nflation has cooled, consumer prices dropped month-over-month for the first time in three years, and gas prices are lower across the country,\" the White House said in announcing the speech, and it went on to praise the Department of Government Efficiency for rooting out \"waste, fraud, and abuse across the executive branch\" and canceling \"numerous discriminatory DEI contracts.\"",
      "DOGE's work continues apace, with billionaire Elon Musk unofficially guiding efforts to downsize government. So far, however, DOGE's cuts aren't anywhere close to approaching the $2 trillion Musk initially said he'd slash from annual spending. Those efforts have also landed the federal government in multiple courtrooms over the firings, downsizing and elimination of government-funded programs.",
      "The Trump administration claims it has done more to secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossings\u00a0have reached\u00a0lows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invoke wartime authorities to send migrants to an El Salvador prison without due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to end\u00a0birthright citizenship.",
      "The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trump claimed in an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries. Americans are skeptical of the president's tariff approach, CBS News polling shows, and most worry they'll contribute to higher prices at a time when high prices are a top concern for voters.",
      "It's unclear how much the president will focus on foreign policy matters, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued the administration has made significant progress on the foreign policy front. After repeatedly saying he would end the war in Ukraine before even taking office, Mr. Trump is now saying those comments were made in \"jest.\"",
      "\"We are closer today to a peace deal in Russia and Ukraine, certainly, than we were when we took office on Jan. 20,\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"If you look at the situation in the Middle East, Israel has never had a stronger friend than they do right now in the Oval Office with President Trump. We've had more than 75 hostages who have returned home from around the world who were wrongfully detained individuals.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday he's ending a program at the Defense Department that promoted the participation of women in peace building and was signed into law by President Trump in 2017.",
      "In his initial post on X, Hegseth called the Women, Peace and Security program \"yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops.\" In a follow-up post, he clarified that the program had been \"ruined\" by the Biden administration.",
      "Hegseth said the Defense Department would comply with the minimum requirements under the law, but would \"fight to end\" the program when Congress sets its next budget.",
      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and national security adviser Mike Waltz, supported the efforts when they were in Congress. It was also championed by Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, who served in the White House during his first term.",
      "Earlier this month, Rubio touted the bill, saying in remarks at the State Department that he was proud to support it. He referred to it as \"the first law passed by any country anywhere in the world focused on protecting women and promoting their participation in society.\"",
      "The program, according to the strategy released during Mr. Trump's first term, seeks to increase women's participation in decision-making processes as well as promote the protection of women and girls' human rights around the world.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who introduced the legislation for the program, said the defense secretary is \"short sighted and doesn't really understand what he's doing\" when asked by CBS News about Hegseth's post on X.",
      "\"We have data that shows what a difference it makes to have women at the table in negotiations,\" Shaheen said. \"We know that peace agreements that are made with women at the table last 35% longer, longer than 15 years if women are at the table.\" On \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, Shaheen was critical of\u00a0Hegseth, who she said has \"created chaos\" at the Pentagon amid a recent staff shakeup.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

Yet, despite promises from Trump administration officials to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" the Pentagon has held just one formal briefing in the first 100 days of President Trump's second term.",
      "\"In line with the secretary's vision to make this the most transparent Department of Defense in history, I gave you my personal commitment to make these briefings more routine,\" said top Pentagon public affairs aide Sean Parnell on March 17, during the only formal briefing conducted so far.",
      "During the same period, the White House and State Department have held 18 and 13 briefings, respectively, as of April 28.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Pentagon had 34 on-camera briefings in its first 100 days while Biden's White House and State Department held 61 and 34 briefings, respectively. During the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's first term, reporters received five on-camera briefings from the Defense Department.",
      "The Pentagon has a long history of briefing the media about military operations. Until his departure in 1968, Barry Zorthian would climb to the rooftop of Saigon's Rex Hotel to give reporters the Pentagon's official version of the Vietnam War. The briefings were branded the \"Five O'Clock Follies\" by skeptical reporters, but even so, the dialogue between spokesperson and journalist provided a critical stream of information about what the government was doing on behalf of American citizens.",
      "The tradition stretched across wars \u2014 from Desert Storm in 1991 to the 1999 Kosovo air campaign \u2014\u00a0 and even during the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Pentagon continued to brief the press regularly.",
      "Retired Rear Adm. T. McCreary, who ran the Navy's public affairs office as the chief of naval information from 2003 to 2006, told CBS News there are three reasons to hold news briefings: To get your story out first, so the public reacts to you; second, to stop the spread of the enemy putting out disinformation to spin the story; and third, to inform the taxpayers what the Pentagon, which has the largest discretionary budget of any department, is doing with its money.",
      "\"Every time the Pentagon and the [Defense Department] establishments start being less forthcoming with information, it erodes the trust and transparency that was built up over years to where the faith and the establishment sometimes starts getting questioned,\" McCreary said.",
      "The Office of the Secretary of Defense's Principles of Information details the Pentagon's guidelines for public affairs. Included is the promise to \"make available timely and accurate information so that the public, the Congress, and the news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy.\"",
      "The single on-camera briefing the Pentagon held 43 days ago took place in the days after U.S. Central Command launched the ongoing campaign against the Houthis. Parnell, the chief spokesperson, and the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich answered questions on the operation.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held news conferences and short question and answer sessions with a small group of reporters while traveling but has not yet conducted an on-camera briefing in the Pentagon Briefing Room, which accommodates about 60 reporters. He has, however, used the briefing room on at least four separate occasions as a backdrop for live interviews with Fox News.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. Central Command issued a press release boasting of hundreds of enemy fighters killed and dozens of command and storage centers destroyed under Operation Rough Rider. The targets, officials said, included advanced missiles, drones, and vessels used in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping lanes\u2014claims offered with little public scrutiny and even fewer questions answered as the total cost of the campaign nears $1 billion, CNN reported.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command with questions on Monday, but neither one has responded.",
      "Soon after the campaign against the Houthis began, Hegseth was embroiled in controversy over sensitive details he shared over Signal on March 15 ahead of the initial strikes.",
      "Hegseth has denied sending any classified information, but over a month later, his use of Signal is still under scrutiny, following the revelation that he shared similar updates in a second chat that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "In that same month, five officials in Hegseth's inner circle have either been fired or left their positions, including John Ullyot, who briefly served as Pentagon Press Secretary and wrote an op-ed after his departure claiming there is \"total chaos\" at the Pentagon.",
      "Hegseth and Parnell, the chief spokesperson, have both denied these claims and have on social media blamed the stories on the media and disgruntled employees, but they have not briefed journalists to address questions.",
      "\"I think the administration would like to talk about something besides Signal, but the problem is they keep screwing it up,\" a former senior defense official told CBS News. \"You know the first thing about being in a bad news cycle is to stop creating news.\"",
      "During the Biden administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in the aftermath of his hospitalization scandal, took questions from the podium in the Pentagon press briefing room. For about 40 minutes, he answered questions and apologized for not disclosing his hospitalization and cancer diagnosis.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate the importance of having the Pentagon hold regular press briefings,\" said Howard Altman, president of the Military Reporters and Editors association in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"The American public has a right to know how and why taxpayer dollars are spent, how those in uniform are faring and, within the boundaries of operational security, the dangers our troops and nation face\u2026this is not a partisan issue,\" he said. \"It is an American one. A well-informed public is a cornerstone of our democracy.\"",
      "Parnell has been going to X to provide weekly situation reports \u2014 or sitreps \u2014 where he talks straight to the camera about Pentagon updates as part of the administration's promise of transparency. The videos released each week do not provide the opportunity for the media to ask questions.",
      "Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon in February created DOD Rapid Response, a social media account on X. The account's bio states it is \"Supporting The Mission of SecDef [Hegseth] And Fighting Against Fake News!\"",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and\u00a0 posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the credit for improved recruitment numbers belongs to Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "The account also posted misleading statements about the Signal chat scandal reported by The Atlantic. The account is overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "\"Holding your policies up to the light of media scrutiny is a good, healthy thing,\" a second former senior defense official said. \"Over time, that scrutiny is very good for the policymaking process because reporters are going to think of things, and they're going to approach the way to ask questions in ways that the policy thinkers and the policy makers may not have done.\"",

      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",

      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month.

      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump has taken new executive actions that echo policies outlined in Project 2025's policy book.",
      "Abolishing the Department of Education",
      "Republicans have long called for the Department of Education to be dismantled, and that recommendation was also made in Project 2025, which declared that \"federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.\"",
      "Mr. Trump took steps to begin that process with an executive order he signed in March. The administration has already cut the Education Department's staff and is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies.",
      "Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025 likewise calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Project 2025's policy book also calls for deleting a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "Some of the Trump administration's early efforts to purge mentions of gender or race resulted in missteps that prompted a public outcry and were later reversed.",
      "Shifting FEMA costs to the states",
      "Shortly after the start of his second term, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said in late January.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\"",
      "The overhaul at FEMA has sparked concerns about the agency's capabilities to deliver disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoes\u00a0in Arkansas, flooding in parts of\u00a0West Virginia and storms\u00a0in Washington.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter earlier this year that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to The New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said the cuts \"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE \u2014 run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations and spending, and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress would be impacted by the order.",
      "The White House then rescinded the memo but maintained the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze. Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo.",
      "Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January that seeks to bar the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Many families and doctors who care for transgender youth dispute that assessment, and a group of families filed a lawsuit claiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed.",
      "Revoking security clearances",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. He also announced he would revoke the security clearances of a number of prominent Democrats including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, under a more narrow set of circumstances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states. Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccines",
      "The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, is now serving as director of the FBI.",
      "Banning transgender people from the military",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprising thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, disputed such claims, saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve.\"",
      "The transgender military ban has since been blocked by two different federal courts, though the decisions have been appealed. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban.",
      "There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. A January report from the Congressional Research Service found that roughly 1,892 active-duty service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon between January 2016 and May 2021. A Feb. 26 memo from the Pentagon found that between 2015 and 2024, it spent $52 million on care for active-duty members of the military to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees, which he extended to July 15. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do so by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group. Health officials in the U.S. and around the world have warned the move will leave people at greater risk of dangerous outbreaks and give China a more dominant role at the World Health Organization.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "Entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended earlier this year in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",
      "The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\"",
      "Rescinding temporary protected status designations",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his administration has moved to end the Temporary Protected Status program for Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "A federal judge in late March agreed to delay the Trump administration's attempt to end the TPS program that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, and a federal appeals court declined to pause that order while proceedings continue.",
      "Project 2025 calls on Congress to \"repeal temporary protected status designations.\"",
      "Capping indirect costs for university-based research",
      "The National Institutes of Health announced in a February memo that it would be capping the amount of funding for \"indirect costs\" at 15%, a cut from an average of between 27% and 28%. Indirect costs cover general expenses like facilities and administration.",
      "NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\"",
      "Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\"",
      "\"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read.",
      "While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally, prompting legal challenges from universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools.",
      "Universities and the NIH said the cuts will have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients.",
      "Requiring disclosures of foreign gifts to universities",
      "As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trump issued a directive on April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year.",
      "The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department.",
      "Asserting the president's power to remove federal officials",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to fire the members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals.",
      "The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appear aimed at asserting what the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\"",
      "Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The next conservative administration should formally take the position that Humphrey's Executor violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" it states.",
      "Targeting NOAA",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, to be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"",
      "The guide says NOAA's six main components should either be downsized or broken up, including Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or OAR, which Project 2025 claims is the \"source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has proposed sweeping changes and job cuts for NOAA, including a 25% cut to its 2026 budget, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs.",
      "Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such as severe weather forecasts\u00a0for the public.",

    "story": [
      "The sun rose on President Trump's 99th day in office Monday to reveal scores of booking photos lining the White House North Lawn's perimeter that the administration claims depict immigrants who have previous convictions or charges such as murder, kidnapping, sexual assault of a child and rape.",
      "The booking photos do not bear the names of the individuals in the photos, but a White House X account posted photos that included names.",
      "The Trump administration is highlighting its aggressive immigration enforcement measures to mark Mr. Trump's nearly 100 days as president, particularly when it comes to immigrants suspected or convicted of violent crimes and drug crimes.",
      "Tuesday will mark 100 days in office for Mr. Trump. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president will sign two executive orders on Monday to empower law enforcement to pursue criminals and to publish a list of U.S. jurisdictions \"that obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\"",
      "\"If you're an illegal alien in the United States, this message is for you. You cannot hide from ICE. We are actively looking for you,\" White House border czar Tom Homan said.",
      "The booking photos, which the White House says show non-citizens in the country illegally, are displayed in a way that they will show up in television appearances by White House journalists and administration officials from the North Lawn. CBS News has not been able to independently verify the White House statements about the individuals in the photos.",
      "\"We will hunt you down,\" the White House X account posted, along with a photo of the North Lawn display. \"You will face justice. You will be deported \u2014 and you will never set foot on American soil again.\"",
      "Homan said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the administration \"got the most secure border in the history of this nation, and President Trump was able to accomplish that in seven weeks.\"",
      "But the Trump administration has been criticized for its handling of some migrant arrests and deportations, particularly after invoking wartime authorities to deport immigrants suspected of being gang members to an El Salvador prison without due process. In recent days, the administration has also been under scrutiny for deporting very young U.S. citizens with their non-citizen mothers out of the country, according to advocates. Homan told Brennan that due process was afforded, saying that U.S. citizens are not deported, but rather, their parents were given the choice to take their children.",

      "CBS News covered the spill for four months, from the frantic efforts to cap the well to bungled attempts to stop the rust-colored crude oil from poisoning beaches and wetlands.

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:39:24 -0400",
    "summary": "A large brood of periodical cicadas is due to emerge in the spring of 2025. These maps show where people should expect to see and hear the bugs this year.",
    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",

      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "summary": "A notably large brood of periodical cicadas will emerge from the underground across parts of the eastern U.S. this spring.",
    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",

      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",

      "Researchers have successfully launched a new satellite that is designed to study the planet's forests and \"provide unprecedented insight\" into how those regions impact the Earth's carbon cycle, the European Space Agency\u00a0 announced on Tuesday.",
      "The satellite, named Biomass, launched with a rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, New Guinea, and separated from the rocket less than an hour after launch,\u00a0 the ESA said in a news release. About 75 minutes after the launch, ESA satellite controllers received Biomass' first signal, indicating that the satellite is working as expected in orbit.",
      "Over the next few days, controllers will carry out the satellite's \"launch and early orbit\" phase, making sure that all systems are working well, the ESA said, and the satellite will make a \"series of intricate maneuvers\" to deploy a nearly 40-foot-wide mesh reflector. That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",
      "\"With Biomass, we are poised to gain vital new data on how much carbon is stored in the world's forests, helping to fill key gaps in our knowledge of the carbon cycle and, ultimately, Earth's climate system,\" said Simonetta Cheli, the ESA's director of Earth observation programs.",
      "Once the radar takes the measurements, the data will be received by the large mesh reflector. It will then be sent to the ESA's mission control center.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-tax-cut-below-200000-income-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 08:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says steep tariffs on U.S. imports will lead to lower taxes for Americans. Is he right?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump describes his administration's sweeping new tariffs on other countries as a tool for accomplishing a range of key economic goals, including reviving U.S. manufacturing. Recently, he's been highlighting another aim: Lowering, or even eliminating, individual income taxes for most Americans.",
      "\"When Tariffs cut in, many people's Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" he wrote Sunday on Truth Social, his social media app.",
      "Tariffs are already kicking in, with businesses around the country facing import duties of 145% or more on imports from China and tariffs of 10% on goods shipped from almost every other nation. Many Americans say they disapprove of these import duties, which are typically passed onto consumers through higher prices, and are bracing for higher inflation as the costs trickle through the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments also point to his earlier assertions that higher tariffs could raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenue in the next year or so. On Sunday, before boarding Air Force One to return from Pope Francis' funeral, Mr. Trump asserted that the revenue raised by his tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax\" in the U.S.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether the Trump administration is developing a proposal to cut taxes for most Americans.",
      "What's the link between tariffs and taxes?",
      "Currently, there is no tax bill in Congress \u2014 the arm of government with the authority to change the tax code \u2014 that would eliminate federal income taxes for people earning $200,000 or less. Even so, the House is working on a reconciliation bill that would extend Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add a few new reductions promised by the president on the campaign trail, such as eliminating taxes on employee tips.",
      "If passed, that bill would mean individuals would continue to pay the same tax rates they've paid since Mr. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took effect beginning for the 2018 tax year, with\u00a0individual tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%, depending on a person's income. And if the legislation is enacted, notably, most Americans would see no difference in their federal income tax rate.",
      "\"There is no real connection\" between Mr. Trump's tariffs and lower taxes, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues. \"He has the authority to impose higher tariffs, and he's done that. But he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cut income taxes \u2014 that's done by Congress.\"",
      "There is \"zero chance\" that Congress would eliminate income taxes for a large swath of the U.S. population because the new tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace the $2.4 trillion in income taxes paid by American households each year, she added.",
      "Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 or twice the current rate under Mr. Trump \u2014 the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "Why tariffs can't replace income taxes",
      "Even the notion of eliminating income taxes for people earning less than $200,000 doesn't add up, York said. Here's why: Mr. Trump's tariffs could raise about $170 billion in revenue this year, whlile wiping out individual taxes for people earning less than $200,000 would forego $700 billion in tax revenue this year, she estimated.",
      "\"You would need tariffs multiple times higher than what we have now\" to generate the revenue to make up for the gap in lost taxes, York said. Making the math work is \"an impossibility,\" she added.",
      "Yet hiking taxes even more aggressively would heighten the risks of a U.S. recession, which would cause job losses, inhibit consumer spending, suppress business investment and further roil financial markets \u2014 all developments that reduce the government's tax receipts.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim about tariffs lowering taxes amounts to \"an argument that says, 'If Americans pay more out of their left pocket, the government will be able to put more in their right pocket',\" said Joe Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, another think tank focused on taxes.",
      "\"Even if you make the math work, it's really replacing one form of tax with another \u2014 and the other important point here is these taxes have very different distributional effects across income types,\" he added.",
      "Translation: Tariffs take a bigger bite out of low- and middle-income Americans' budgets because they spend a larger share of their incomes on basics like food and household goods than compared with high-income Americans. A typical low-income household is likely to see their disposable income fall by 5.5% under Mr. Trump's tariffs, compared with 1.9% for the highest-earning families, according to a March 31\u00a0estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "But faced with higher prices for consumer goods, many households would cut back on spending, adding to the challenges of relying on tariffs to raise enough revenue to replace income taxes, experts say.",
      "Dueling goals",
      "Mr. Trump's move lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1943\u00a0reflects conflicting aims, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For instance, the president has said he wants to use tariffs to secure better trade deals with other nations. Yet reaching new trade pacts with lower tariff rates would undercut the president's goal of relying on import duties to replace the federal income tax.",
      "Mr. Trump's back-and forth on his tariffs, including temporarily rolling back some import fees and creating exclusions for certain products, also undermines the administration's ability to generate a new source of federal revenue, Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "\"If you are tariffs on, tariffs off, because of these negotiations that are supposedly going on, you're not raising much revenue, or protecting industry or getting new investment the United States because of all the uncertainty,\" Lincicome said.",
      "By dangling the prospect of a tax cut, Mr. Trump may be seeking to convince Americans to bear the brunt of the tariffs' impact, which economists say could slow U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"Americans are about to find out really fast that this is a tax on us,\" York noted. \"It will hurt our trading partners, too, but it is a tax that in large part falls on American businesses and American workers.\"",

    "summary": "Eleven students suspected of carrying out a hazing scheme in upstate New York were given 48 hours to turn themselves in to authorities.",
    "story": [
      "A group of students accused of being involved in an apparent hazing scheme in upstate New York have turned themselves in after they were given 48 hours to do so or else face kidnapping charges for the incident, which authorities say targeted younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team.",
      "Eleven students who allegedly played a part in the event turned themselves in on Wednesday, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said. The district attorney previously told CBS News that the deadline for the perpetrators to turn themselves in was \"close of business Thursday.\"",
      "\"This is criminal activity, and this is hazing on steroids,\" Fitzpatrick said Tuesday during a news conference, noting it \"could have resulted in such tragedy.\"",
      "An attorney representing the 11 students said in a statement to CBS News late Wednesday night that the \"young men deeply regret their involvement in what began as a misguided attempt at a prank. They recognize that their actions were inappropriate, and do not minimize the fear and distress experienced by the other students.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said his office and the county sheriff's department are working together to prosecute the case, after the sheriff received a call from the high school's resource officer reporting that a newer member of the boys lacrosse team had been tied up and thrown into the back of a teammate's vehicle. The incident seemed to be an example of hazing or, if not, some sort of extreme prank, Fitzpatrick said.",
      "Older lacrosse players allegedly set up their plot by arranging an evening out with five younger members of the Westhill team, Fitzpatrick said, which was supposed to include watching a lacrosse game and picking up food from McDonald's. An older player was driving the younger ones and pretended to get lost in an isolated section of the county, where a group of accomplices emerged in masks and black clothing, imitating an abduction with at least one gun and one knife, according to the district attorney.",
      "All of the younger players escaped except for one, whose hands were tied while a pillowcase was placed over his head, and he was thrown into the trunk of the car, Fitzpatrick said.",
      "\"I could imagine a deputy coming upon a scene, seeing a kid with a hood over his head being abducted at gunpoint by a series of individuals all dressed in black and masked,\" he said. \"If that individual opened fire, you know, would that be outside the realm of possibility? I think the opposite would be true.\"",
      "No injuries have been reported in connection with the incident, and the perpetrators returned the student to his home at the end of the night, Fitzpatrick said. Citing a video, he said authorities believe 11 people, who appear to be on the boys lacrosse team, carried out the scheme and urged them to come forward in order to avoid facing kidnapping charges and being tried as adults. The identities or exact ages of the people involved have not been released.",
      "\"I have seen the videotape of what happened to this young man. It is not a rite of passage. It is not a trivial matter,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I don't know how long this young man will be affected by what happened to him. Frankly, I find it incomprehensible that in this day and age somebody could have thought that they would have gotten away with something like this.\"",
      "After the 11 people turned themselves in, Fitzpatrick said he would not be releasing the video at this time.",
      "No charges had been filed as of Tuesday. The district attorney previously said that those who choose to turn themselves in will likely avoid criminal records and face prosecution in family court instead. A representative for the school district told CBS News in a statement that it is cooperating with law enforcement's investigation.",
      "\"We are aware of the District Attorney's statement and are continuing to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation,\" Lisa O'Reilly, president of the Westhill Central School District's board of education, said in a statement to CBS News. \"At this time, the District has no additional information to share. While the investigation is ongoing, we remain committed to the values of student safety, dignity, and accountability. We remain in close contact with law enforcement and remain focused on supporting our students and ensuring the safety and well-being of our school community.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has strongly rebuked Apple, finding that the iPhone maker willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. On Wednesday, she found that Apple violated a 2021 injunction that, she wrote, sought to \"restrain and prohibit the iPhone maker's anticompetitive conduct\" and pricing.",
      "\"Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote in Wednesday's ruling, which held Apple in contempt.",
      "She ordered that Apple \"no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday night, an Apple spokesperson said: \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\"",
      "Epic first filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce.",
      "Although Gonzalez Rogers had rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. The Supreme Court rejected Apple's appeal in the case in January 2024.",
      "\"In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,\" the judge wrote on Wednesday. She accused Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman of \"outright\" lying under oath.",
      "\"Internally, (longtime Apple executive) Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but (CEO) Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote.",
      "The judge referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",

      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. And he did the right thing.\"",
      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "A Treasury Department press release said the two countries have agreed to establish a \"United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund,\" referring to it as an \"economic partnership.\" The statement did not include more detail about the agreement.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, confirmed that she signed the deal. In a series of posts on X written in Ukrainian, she described it as a 50/50 partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. She said the deal would be funded through direct investment, future U.S. aid and revenue from new mineral licensing deals \u2014 and does not set up any Ukrainian debt obligations.",
      "According to a Ukrainian fact sheet, the U.S. would contribute to the fund \"either through direct financial input or through new military assistance,\" and the agreement \"focuses on further, not past U.S. military assistance.\" Ukraine would contribute 50% of any royalties from future \u2014 but not existing \u2014 oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine would hold onto ownership of its natural resources, and the fund can only be invested in resource and infrastructure projects within Ukraine. Profits from the fund would be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, and can be \"distributed between the partners\" after that, the fact sheet also said.",
      "An official at the Development Finance Corporation \u2014 a U.S. government agency helping to oversee the deal \u2014 said the joint fund will \"make strategic investments in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, natural resources, and natural resources-related infrastructure in Ukraine, which will help diversify and secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security.\"",
      "The fund will also \"select vital critical minerals to the United States for offtake,\" the official said.",

Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's reserves of rare earth elements, which are used in electronics, defense technology and energy projects. Some of the country's reserves are located in parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in an interview with NewsNation late Wednesday. \"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have,\" Trump said, of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves.",
      "Zelenskyy initially traveled to Washington in February to sign a mineral deal with Mr. Trump. Those plans were\u00a0derailed\u00a0after an explosive Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance. During the meeting, Vance accused Zelenskyy of being\u00a0insufficiently grateful\u00a0for U.S. military aid.",
      "Negotiations continued despite the public acrimony. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting the U.S. was prepared to sign a deal, but Ukraine had requested \"last minute changes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has cast the mineral deal as a key part of his broader gambit to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.",
      "Those talks have proven rocky: At least twice in recent weeks, Trump administration officials have threatened to pull out of negotiations unless more progress is made. Mr. Trump has lashed out at Zelenskyy repeatedly, calling him a \"dictator\" earlier this year and accusing him last week of prolonging the war by refusing to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. The two leaders held a private meeting Saturday in the Vatican while attending the funeral of Pope Francis.",

      "As one of the 1,000 or so people in the U.K. who receive a cancer diagnosis every day, Charles said his journey had given him \"an even deeper appreciation of the extraordinary work\" of charities.",
      "\"Each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening experience for those individuals and their loved ones,\" he said. \"But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.\"",
      "The 76-year-old monarch, who is still undergoing treatment more than a year on from his diagnosis for an undisclosed cancer, also said that his experience had reinforced how \"the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion.\"",

      "Iran hanged a man on Wednesday who was convicted of working as a spy for Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, and assisting in the 2022 assassination of a Revolutionary Guard colonel in Tehran, according to the Islamic republic's official\u00a0IRNA news agency. An activist group says his confession was forced.",
      "Mohsen Langarneshin, identified by the news agency as one of the Mossad's \"top spies inside Iran,\" allegedly provided \"technical support\" in the killing of Col. Hassan Sayyad Khodaei, who was shot five times by two unidentified gunmen on a motorbike \u2014 said to have been purchased by Langarneshin \u2014 near his home in Tehran.",
      "At the time of his killing, Iranian media identified Khodaei only as a \"defender of the shrine,\" according to The Associated Press. The term is a euphemism used by Iran to refer to Iranians fighting against ISIS in Syria and Iraq within the Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force.",
      "IRNA said Langarneshin had also provided support for an attack on an industrial center linked to the Iranian defense ministry, purchased vehicles and equipment \"to create a secure environment for Mossad elements in Iran,\" transferred money from Mossad officers to contacts inside the country and rented safe houses in several Iranian provinces. One of those homes was in Isfahan, where, in January 2023, bomb-carrying drones targeted what Iran described as a military workshop. Iran has accused Israel of masterminding the attack.",
      "Langarneshin was recruited by the Mossad in 2020 and worked for the Israelis for two years, according to Iran's state-run media, during which time he met with Mossad officers in the nation of Georgia and Nepal, \"and received his missions.\"",
      "IRNA said Langerneshin confessed \"during all stages of the interrogation, prosecution and court proceedings,\" after being \"confronted with extensive case documents.\"",
      "The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a non-profit group focused on rights issues in Iran,\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday that a source close to Langerneshin's family had recently told the organization that he \"had been promised that if he repeated what the interrogators wanted on camera, he would only face imprisonment. As a result, the confessions were extracted under pressure and coercion.\"",
      "The organization quoted another source whom it said was close to Langarneshin as saying that he \"was taken to the specified location and forced to narrate a prewritten script by interrogators, which was filmed.\"",
      "Masoud Langarneshin, Mohsen's father, released a video in the days before the execution claiming his son had been sentenced to death without a fair trial.

      "They turned off the motorized equipment and set to work with pickaxes and shovels. The crew found two skeletons, then more. By March, 33 sets of bones lay in a tight cluster of unmarked burial pits in the shadow of a Byzantine fortress.",
      "\"We found many bullets in the heads, the skulls,\" supervising engineer Haris Charismiadis said, standing on earth overturned by four months of digging.",
      "It's common to find ancient remains or objects in Greece. But hulking Yedi Kule castle was a prison where Communist sympathizers were tortured and executed during Greece's 1946\u201349 Civil War. Tens of thousands died in the early Cold War-era battles between Western-backed government forces and left-wing insurgents, a brutal conflict with assassination squads, child abductions and mass displacements. CBS News journalist\u00a0George Polk, who had depicted the right-wing Greek government as corrupt, was\u00a0among those killed\u00a0during the war.",
      "Greece's archaeological service cleared the site for development because the bones are less than 100 years old. But authorities in Neapolis-Sykies, a suburb of the coastal city of Thessaloniki, pressed on with excavation, saying the chance find has \"great historical and national importance.\"",
      "Descendants have been coming to the site in recent weeks, leaving flowers and asking authorities to conduct DNA testing \"so they can retrieve the remains of their grandfather, great-grandfather or uncle,\" said Simos Daniilidis, who has served as Neapolis-Sykies' mayor since 1994.",
      "As many as 400 Yedi Kule prisoners were executed, according to historians and the Greek Communist Party. Items found with the bodies \u2014 a woman's shoe, a handbag, a ring \u2014 offer glimpses into the lives cut short.",
      "Wartime legacy",
      "For the families of slain pro-Communist Greeks, the find in the Park of National Resistance is reviving a wartime legacy kept dormant to avoid reigniting old animosities. The small site has become Greece's first Civil War mass grave to be exhumed.",
      "Government forces executed 19-year-old Agapios Sachinis after he refused to sign a declaration renouncing his political beliefs.",
      "\"These are not simple matters,\" his namesake nephew said during a recent visit to the site.",
      "\"It's about carrying inside you not just courage, but values and dignity you won't compromise \u2014 not even to save your own life,\" said Agapios Sachinis, 78.",
      "A retired Communist city council member, Sachinis was imprisoned in the 1960s for his political activity during the dictatorship. Today, Greece's Communist Party belongs to the political mainstream, largely thanks to its role in the country's WWII resistance.",
      "If Sachinis' uncle's remains are identified, he said, he will cremate them and keep the ashes at his home.",
      "\"I want Agapios close to me, at least while I'm alive,\" he said.",
      "Cold War playbook",
      "Greece's Civil War began in the wake of World War II. Coming after continent-wide destruction, it quickly lost international attention but the conflict marked a turning point: U.S. President Harry Truman's policy of anti-communist intervention \u2014 the Truman Doctrine \u2014 was presented to Congress in 1947 as a means to direct funds and military support to Greece.",
      "Etched on the newly excavated bones in Thessaloniki, then, is a playbook that went on to produce decades of repression, societal divisions and more unmarked graves in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Governments later addressing the Cold War-era abuses and atrocities faced a painful choice: to unearth the past \u2014 as attempted with investigative commissions in Eastern Europe and many Latin American countries \u2014 or suppress it for fear of fresh division.",
      "Greek emergency laws were gradually lifted and only fully abolished in 1989. Records of summary trials and executions were never made public. No political force pushed for the excavation of suspected burial sites.",
      "Politicians still use highly cautious language when addressing the past and the Thessaloniki discovery was met with a subdued public reaction. The find has not been directly addressed by the country's center-right government \u2014 a reminder that many Greeks still find it easier to walk past the country's ghosts than confront them.",
      "Decades ago, the neighborhood park in Thessaloniki \u2014 a densely populated port city of a million with ruins from the ancient Greek, Roman and Ottoman eras, with historically strong Balkan and Jewish influences \u2014 was a field on the outskirts of the city. Today, it's frequented by retirees and ringed by apartment buildings filled with middle-class families. During construction, residents whispered that bones had been discovered when foundations were laid, but no inquiry was conducted.",
      "\"Flowers of their generation\"",
      "Executions by army firing squads extended into the 1950s and were publicly announced, but graves were unmarked and secret. Author and historian Spyros Kouzinopoulos, a Thessaloniki native, spent decades researching the executions at Yedi Kule, including the indignities endured by prisoners in their final hours.",
      "After a military tribunal issued a death sentence, the chief guard would take the condemned prisoner to solitary confinement in tiny cells barely big enough to stand. Many would use their last hours to write letters to their families. At dawn, the chief guard and two others would retrieve the prisoner and hand them over to the firing squad. Most were loaded onto trucks to avoid attracting public attention. Sometimes they were led to their death on foot.",
      "Most of the victims were barely adults \u2014 youth Kouzinopoulos called \"flowers of their generation.\"",
      "Two 17-year-old schoolgirls, Efpraxia Nikolaidou and Eva Kourouzidou, were executed while wearing their uniforms, he said.",
      "\"It shook me to the core,\" Kouzinopoulos said.",

    "story": [
      "Global military expenditure rose by 9.4% in 2024 to $2.7 trillion, the steepest yearly rise since the end of the Cold War, according to data compiled by the global security think tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Spending in Europe, including Russia, was a big factor behind the global surge in spending, SIPRI said.",
      "European nations' collective spending increased by 17% to $693 billion amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, the organization's data show.",
      "Russia's government increased its military spending by 38% to an estimated $149 billion last year, while Ukraine's grew by 2.9% to $64.7 billion. The Ukrainian spending amounted to 34% of the country's GDP, the largest military expenditure by percentage of GDP of any nation last year, according to SIPRI.",
      "\"Russia once again significantly increased its military spending, widening the spending gap with Ukraine,\" said Diego Lopes da Silva, a senior researcher at SIPRI. \"Ukraine currently allocates all of its tax revenues to its military. In such a tight fiscal space, it will be challenging for Ukraine to keep increasing its military spending.\"",
      "All NATO member nations increased their military spending, too, with 18 countries spending at least 2% of their GDP during 2024, which SIPRI said was the highest number of NATO members to hit that threshold since the alliance adopted it as a spending guideline in 2014.",
      "\"The rapid spending increases among European NATO members were driven mainly by the ongoing Russian threat and concerns about possible U.S. disengagement within the alliance,\" said Jade Guiberteau Ricard, another SIPRI researcher. \"It is worth saying that boosting spending alone will not necessarily translate into significantly greater military capability or independence from the USA. Those are far more complex tasks.\"",
      "In the Middle East, Israel and Lebanon significantly increased their military spending. Israel boosted its defense investment by 65% to $46.5 billion, while Lebanon increased its own by 58%, to $635 million.",
      "\"Despite widespread expectations that many Middle Eastern countries would increase their military spending in 2024, major rises were limited to Israel and Lebanon,\" said SIPRI researcher Zubaida Karim. \"Elsewhere [in the region], countries either did not significantly increase spending in response to the war in Gaza or were prevented from doing so by economic constraints.\"",
      "SIPRI said Iran's military expenditure fell in real terms by 10% to $7.9 billion, despite its involvement in regional conflicts.",
      "U.S. military spending grew by 5.7% to $997 billion, amounting to 66% of NATO spending in 2024 and 37% of global military spending.",
      "China was the world's second largest military spender last year behind the U.S., accounting for half of all military spending in Asia and Oceania, SIPRI said. China increased its spending by 7% to $314 billion.",
      "\"Major military spenders in the Asia-Pacific region are investing increasing resources into advanced military capabilities,\" said Nan Tian, the director of the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Program. \"With several unresolved disputes and mounting tensions, these investments risk sending the region into a dangerous arms-race spiral.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-deportation-flights-avelo-airlines/",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Avelo Airlines says it's counting on a new federal contract for deportation flights to help the discount carrier grow its regular passenger service.",
    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",
      "\"There's not much I can do as an individual, so the limited choices I can make, like switching an airline, is definitely within my ability,\" he told CBS News Bay Area.",

      "She adds that she\u2019s \"old-school in my belief\u00a0system when it comes to relationships, not out of blind faith, but because through my 13 years working with thousands of singles and couples, I have studied the science of relationships, researched all of the potential outcomes, and kept to date with countless studies that all lead to the same conclusion: living with a spouse (with the disclaimer that they are a relatively healthy spouse aka they are not struggling with addiction or mental illness) is statistically linked to a longer lifespan, stronger happiness/mental health ratings, and literally yields\u00a0children that are more productive members of society.\"",
      "She says the \"family system\" works, \"and this is why it's been in place for centuries.\"",
      "\"The family system works, and this is why it's been in place for centuries.\"",
      "\"In fact,\" she adds, \"I would push for an extended family unit, which includes grandparents, cousins, etc., because we're seeing a stark rise in loneliness in the last five years, and it has become a psychological pandemic of sorts. In Japan, people can even rent a family; they essentially pay \u2018actors' to play their husband/wife/children for a day.\"",
      "She says she recently found out from a \"beautiful and successful woman\" in a professional women\u2019s group about hiring a \"body double,\" a person who is paid just to be present \"while they work/live/do life.\"",
      "\"While I do not judge the woman in the group, it is devastating to me as a Matchmaker that we as a society are normalizing paying someone to be a companion,\" she says. \"This is one of the benefits of a relationship. Separating or normalizing not living with a spouse is [a] slippery\u00a0slope.\"",

      "\"Physically being with your partner also releases essential hormones for happiness: dopamine, serotonin, and it reduces the stress hormone cortisol.\"",
      "Conti, however, is a fan of apartnering before marriage.",
      "\"Not living together until marriage may seem like an antiquated idea, but it's actually backed by countless studies and science; if you want your relationship to last, wait to live together until marriage.\""

Looking to the future, Turner said implementing work requirements for those in HUD-funded housing programs will be a priority, among others.",

      "Dozens of school choice advocates gathered outside the Supreme Court Wednesday as justices weighed whether public funds could go directly to religious charter schools.",
      "The protesters rallied and held signs that said \"all students, all options, all dollars\" and \"free to learn,\" as they advocated for expanded access to alternatives to traditional public schools, especially for students who struggle in those settings.",
      "The case, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School v. Drummond, challenges a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that struck down a contract establishing St. Isidore \u2013 a publicly funded, Catholic online school \u2013 as a violation of state and federal law. Now before the U.S. Supreme Court, advocates argue that excluding religious schools from state-run charter programs amounts to unconstitutional discrimination.",
      "\"The court has time and time again said that the Free Exercise Clause demands that the government treat religious and secular organizations the same, and that\u2019s not what happened here. The state excluded St. Isidore simply because of its religious character, that\u2019s wrong and bad for parents,\" said Kate Anderson, an attorney at ADF working on the case.",

      "For students like Contina Jones\u2019 son, public schools are not always a good fit. \"He was very sad, very emotional every day, he was overstimulated, teachers were in and out, and I needed something that was able to cater to how my son learns,\" said Jones, a Mississippi resident who joined the crowd outside the court. \"Every child, regardless of zip code, should be able to go to a school that is for them for their families.\"",
      "The justices are being asked to weigh whether a religious charter school is entitled to the same treatment and funding as a secular one \u2013 a question that could redefine how states draw the line between church and state in public education.",
      "\"Charter schools are not public schools in the same way as traditional ones,\" said Thomas Fisher, executive vice president of EdChoice. \"They\u2019re designed to have curricula other than what public schools provide. The First Amendment protects their free exercise and doesn\u2019t prohibit them from exercising their religion.\"",
      "At issue is whether the school should be considered a public school \u2013 which have largely been considered as extensions of the state government, and required to be nonreligious under the Establishment Clause \u2013 or whether it should\u00a0be considered private entities or contractors.",
      "Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican who is running for governor, filed the lawsuit against the school, stating that the establishment of St. Isidore would violate both the Oklahoma Constitution and the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

      "\"The key here is that this school is its own school. This school is not a state school \u2013 it\u2019s a charter school. It has the ability to set its own curriculum,\" added John Tidwell, Oklahoma state director of Americans for Prosperity.",

If they can offer high-quality education, families should be able to access those options with public funds.\"",

      "Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker\u2019s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you\u2019ll need to repeat the process regularly to keep your data private.

But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

If they become aggressive and try to exploit you, tell them you will report them and hang up.",

These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",

      "The KA-01 mission deployed 27 advanced satellites into low Earth orbit at an altitude of 280 miles (450 kilometers). This launch transitioned\u00a0Project Kuiper from prototype testing to full-scale deployment. Each satellite was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including phased array antennas for high-speed data transmission, advanced processors, electric propulsion systems for orbit adjustments and optical inter-satellite links to enable seamless communication between satellites.",

While both systems share similarities, such as using low Earth orbit satellites for reduced latency, they differ in key aspects like satellite design, pricing and service goals.",
      "Starlink: With over 7,000 satellites already in orbit and plans for a constellation of up to 42,000, Starlink currently leads in deployment. Its satellites orbit at approximately 248 miles, allowing for lower latency but requiring more satellites for global coverage.",
      "Project Kuiper: Kuiper plans to deploy over 3,200 satellites orbiting at 311 miles. This higher altitude provides broader coverage per satellite but results in a 40% reduction in signal strength compared to Starlink due to increased distance. To compensate, Kuiper\u2019s satellites use larger antennas to maintain performance.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",
      "Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up.",
      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",
      "A woman working on her laptop and scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",
      "A man working on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson talks about a soft, vine-like robot called SPROUT that aids safe survivor rescues in collapsed buildings.",
      "When disaster strikes and buildings collapse, every second counts for emergency responders searching for survivors trapped beneath rubble. Traditional tools often fall short in these dangerous, chaotic environments, but a new breed of robot, SPROUT, is poised to make a life-saving difference.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is SPROUT?",
      "SPROUT, short for Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit, is a flexible, vine-like robot developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. Unlike rigid robots or static cameras, SPROUT can \"grow\" into tight, winding spaces that are otherwise inaccessible, giving first responders a new way to explore, map and assess collapsed structures.",
      "Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ELECTRIC SUV IS THE ULTIMATE LIFELINE FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS",
      "How does SPROUT work?",
      "SPROUT is made of an airtight fabric tube that inflates with air, allowing it to extend from a fixed base. As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",
      "Three pouch motors along the vine\u2019s length enable SPROUT to bend and turn, while an internal reel system allows the robot to be compactly stored and precisely deployed as needed. In addition to cameras, SPROUT can carry other sensors to image, map and even assess hazards within the collapsed structure.",

      "RESCUE DRONE HITS BEACHES DESIGNED TO SAVE LIVES AS A FLYING LIFEBUOY",
      "Why traditional tools fall short",
      "Traditional search-and-rescue gear, such as rigid robots or specialized cameras, struggles in disaster zones for several reasons. Cameras can only probe straight paths, often requiring teams to cut new access holes to see further into the rubble.",
      "Rigid robots are prone to damage in unstable, cramped environments and are expensive to repair. Manual probing is time-consuming and physically exhausting for responders.",
      "SPROUT\u2019s soft, flexible design directly addresses these challenges, offering a safer, faster and more adaptable solution for navigating the unpredictable landscape of collapsed buildings.",

      "Real-world testing and impact",
      "SPROUT has already been put through its paces at the Massachusetts Task Force 1 training site, where it demonstrated its ability to flex around corners and penetrate void spaces in engineered collapsed structures. These tests allowed the team to refine SPROUT\u2019s durability, portability and steering controls, with plans for larger field studies underway.",
      "The project is a true collaboration, pairing MIT\u2019s engineering expertise with Professor Margaret Coad\u2019s pioneering work on vine robots at Notre Dame. This partnership has accelerated SPROUT\u2019s development, bringing hands-on demonstrations to first responders, many of whom have limited research and development budgets.",

      "Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Looking ahead: The future of SPROUT",
      "The team behind SPROUT is continuously working to expand its capabilities. Current models can extend up to 10 feet, with future versions aiming to reach beyond 25 feet. Researchers are also exploring the use of multiple SPROUT robots to cover larger areas and expedite rescue operations in major disasters.",
      "Beyond disaster response, the technology could be adapted for inspecting military systems or critical infrastructure in hard-to-reach places, making SPROUT a versatile tool for a variety of high-stakes scenarios.",

      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Healthcare institutions and insurers arguably collect the most sensitive information about you, including IDs, contact details, addresses and medical records. But they often don\u2019t put in the same level of effort to protect that data.",

      "A person doing a Google search\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson))",
      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",
      "A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach:",
      "\"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\"",

      "Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",
      "Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings.",

      "1. Limit what you share on health portals:\u00a0Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible.",
      "2. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0Browsers like Brave or Firefox offer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity.",
      "3. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Visit\u00a0Google\u2019s Ad Settings and disable ad personalization. This won\u2019t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting.",
      "4. Opt out of tracking where possible:\u00a0Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it.",
      "5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):\u00a0Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that\u2019s a cue to proceed cautiously.",
      "6. Monitor your accounts and credit:\u00a0Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach.",
      "7. Ask questions:\u00a0Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards.",

      "Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you\u2019re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one.

      "It's considered the largest password compilation ever released.\u00a0With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high. For anyone still reusing passwords, the dangers are real \u2014 and growing.",

      "Username and password on tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why does password strength matter?",
      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

Grab a pen (or just keep a mental tally) and score yourself based on this 7-point password strength test.\u00a0Each \"yes\" earns you a point.\u00a0So, let\u2019s see how your password holds up in today\u2019s threat landscape.",
      "Length is your first line of defense. Short passwords \u2014 think six or eight characters \u2014 can be cracked in minutes by modern hacking tools. At 12 characters or more, you\u2019re making it exponentially harder for attacks to succeed.",
      "Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters strengthens your password by increasing complexity. For example, instead of using something like \"t8g5k9w2,\" use \"T8g5K9w2\" \u2014 same characters, just more variety. Mix it up.",
      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",
      "Even good passwords can go stale. It\u2019s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.",

      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Most companies use different vendors to run different parts of their business, such as customer management, finances, payroll and social media. To do this, they share access to customer data with these platforms. The issue is that not all vendors take cybersecurity seriously, and hackers are well aware of that.",
      "More and more, attackers are going after these weaker links in the digital supply chain. These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company\u2019s main systems. It\u2019s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers.",
      "One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up!",
      "Hertz rental location (Hertz)",
      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, in October 2024 and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What does this mean for customers?",
      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert.",

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

Hutchinson served eight years in the Army, part of it as an elite Ranger.",
      "In court filings, Hutchinson's lawyers argued he suffers from Gulf War Illness (GWI) -- a series of health problems stemming from the 1990-1991 war in Iraq -- as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia related to his claim that he was targeted by government surveillance.",

GWI affects Veterans who served in the Army and the Marine Corps at higher rates than those who served in the Navy and Air Force, and enlisted personnel are affected more than others,\" it also said.",

Hutchinson was located by police in the garage with a phone still connected to the 911 center and gunshot residue on his hands.",

      "\"The issue is mostly related to the population,\" James McDanolds, program chair of the School of Uncrewed Technology at Sonoran Desert Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"Airports like Newark are surrounded by highly populated areas, including New York City across the Hudson. There are more people who purchase UAVs who are either interested in them as toys or something to experiment with who don\u2019t know about airspace. \"",
      "Additionally, planes are more vulnerable to near-misses from drones when taking off and landing due to their low altitudes, with FAA regulations allowing drones to fly as high as 400 feet in unrestricted airspace.",
      "\"Manned aircraft have to be at a lower altitude as part of their landing pattern until they are further away from the airport,\" McDanolds said. \"As UAVs are allowed to fly up to 400 feet above ground level, most manned aircraft in the landing pattern are anywhere from 100 feet above ground level to zero feet above ground level during takeoff and landing. During the final approach, when a manned aircraft descends to the runway, it comes into the 400 feet to zero feet above ground level range, and that is where the near misses with UAVs in the airport airspace occur.\"",

      "The idea floated was that Biden would give a speech directly to the Israeli public, presenting two options, according to his Middle East advisor Ilan Goldenberg. \"A lot of people were talking about, including in the Oval Office at times, the idea of, like, the President going out and giving a speech.

Your sons and daughters are going to keep fighting. Most of the hostages are going to come home dead.

That's what people were saying, like, \u2018let's just break this up because it's not going anywhere good.\u2019\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are already hitting some snags as they begin the work of crafting a bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy agenda. And they haven\u2019t even made some of their hardest decisions yet.",
      "Fresh off a two-week recess, House committees have begun marking up their respective pieces of the package, which aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military, and increase the debt ceiling. In their hunt for steep savings to pay for it all, Republicans are starting with some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes to spending cuts.",
      "But that process has already sparked some skirmishes among Republican lawmakers, offering a preview of the bigger intraparty fights \u2014 such as whether to slash funding for anti-poverty programs like Medicaid \u2014 that are still to come.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., the chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, on Wednesday was forced at the eleventh hour to yank a provision out of his panel\u2019s portion of the package that would have created a new $20 annual fee on nearly all passenger vehicles after conservatives revolted.",
      "Separately, on the Judiciary Committee, a push by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., to codify Trump\u2019s proposal of a \u201cgold card\u201d visa for wealthy foreigners was rejected by conservatives opposed to expanding visa programs.",
      "And on the Education and Workforce Committee, Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., on Tuesday pushed through an overhaul of student loan programs that would cut $351 billion in federal spending, drawing criticisms from Democrats. The most contentious part of that overhaul, Walberg said, is a \u201crisk-sharing\u201d provision that would make colleges, universities and trade schools partially responsible for unpaid student loan balances.",
      "\u201cAll the committees are making tough decisions, and we\u2019re gonna build this bill,\u201d said Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives on Capitol Hill.",
      "After passing their budget framework for Trump\u2019s \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d earlier this month, House Republicans are now trying to fill out the details.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he thinks the House can cobble together all the separate pieces and send the package to the Senate by Memorial Day \u2014 an ambitious but not impossible deadline. But it means Republican leaders, committee chairpeople and rank-and-file members are now having the politically tricky conversations about how to pay for the bill and what might get cut.",
      "And every House Republican\u2019s opinion matters in the process because of the party's fragile 220-213 majority.",
      "\u201cJust about every step of the way has been difficult with a small majority,\u201d Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters, adding that he\u2019s also had \u201ca lot\u201d of conversations with senators as well to make sure both chambers are on the same page.",
      "Perhaps the trickiest issue Republicans still need to resolve is how to handle potential Medicaid cuts, which vulnerable and moderate Republicans have strongly warned against.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the program and is responsible for finding a whopping $880 billion in cuts for the bill, is planning to hold a markup on May 7, but has to finalize its portion of the package. The committee\u2019s chairman has been meeting with members from all across the ideological spectrum as they try to find a solution.",
      "But even smaller, less innocuous issues can trip up the entire process. The vehicle fee was an example of an issue that unexpectedly blew up at the last minute. Graves, the Transportation Committee chairman, had included the provision in his panel\u2019s package to help meet the committee\u2019s so-called \"reconciliation\" instructions, which dictate what each panel is required to cut or allowed to spend.",
      "Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the former chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, offered an amendment to kill it as conservatives disparaged it as a \u201ccar tax.\u201d Graves\u2019 team checked in with committee members to gauge support for the fee, two Republican sources said, but it became clear there was too much opposition and Graves made the call Tuesday night to pull it from the package.",
      "The committee was then forced to find other ways to hit its saving goals. The package will now boost an annual fee for electric vehicles to $250, up from the originally proposed $200, as well as reduce funding for air traffic control modernization to $12.5 billion, down from the initial $15 billion that was proposed.",
      "\u201cEV owners have not been paying anything into the highway trust fund and justifiably, now they will,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, who opposed the $20 passenger car fee. \u201cI\u2019m very glad there won\u2019t be any fees on gasoline driven vehicles whose owners and drivers have already been paying their fair share into the highway trust fund through the federal gasoline tax.\u201d",
      "Another GOP spat emerged on the Judiciary Committee over visas. Issa, a senior member of the panel, had hoped to include in Wednesday\u2019s committee\u2019s markup Trump\u2019s idea to sell $5 million gold card visas that would offer immigrants legal permanent residency and a path to citizenship.",
      "Issa argued the proposal could bring in at least an additional $150 billion to pay for the bill. But Issa said another member of the panel, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, effectively vetoed the idea.",
      "\u201cI got screwed out of the gold card because a few of our members wouldn\u2019t go along with having an expansion of revenue related to visas, EB-5 and H-1,\u201d Issa said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThe president\u2019s point [is] that we should be able to generate revenue by bringing the investors in to invest, and we have a program that brings in very little by comparison. But Chip killed it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would be voting for reconciliation,\u201d Issa added, \u201cbut I would be disappointed when it\u2019s left out.\u201d",
      "Roy did not respond to a request for comment. A Judiciary Committee spokesman suggested that Republicans still could revisit the gold card issue.",
      "\"We are working hand-in-glove with the White House and totally support President Trump's agenda,\" spokesman Russell Dye said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "These types of decisions, however, are the easy ones. The hard ones will need to be resolved in the coming days and weeks. On Wednesday afternoon, Johnson hosted a meeting with Republicans from blue states like New York, New Jersey and California who are aggressively pushing to raise the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction in the package.",
      "The House Ways and Means Committee, where that issue will be decided, will likely meet sometime next week.",
      "\"It was a lively discussion but we're still far away from a deal,\" Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said as he left the nearly hourlong SALT meeting. \"I want to ensure we make whole as many of our middle class families as possible.\"",
      "On Medicaid, Republicans facing tough re-election fights in the 2026 midterm elections are worried it\u2019s not mathematically possible to achieve their spending targets without a steep cut to Medicaid, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Republican leaders have said they only want to target waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid system. Leaving a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chair of the Budget Committee, reiterated that the GOP wants to impose work requirements for Medicaid eligibility to raise the revenue needed to fund Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea of using Medicaid to help able-bodied people who could be working, most Americans will say no to,\u201d Graham said. \u201cMedicaid was designed to help poor people and disabled people \u2026 We got a chance to fix it. And if we fail, I think we\u2019ll pay a heavy price.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 13:26:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Days earlier, Venezuelan detainees at the center were given notices by immigration officials that alleged they were Tren de Aragua members and subject to deportation under a wartime law.",
    "story": [
      "Detainees at the Bluebonnet immigrant detention center in the small city of Anson,\u00a0Texas, sent the outside world a message this week: S-O-S.",
      "With a Reuters drone flying nearby, 31 men formed the letters in the dirt yard of the facility on Monday.",
      "Ten days earlier, dozens of Venezuelan detainees at the center were given notices by immigration officials that alleged they were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and subject to deportation under a wartime law, according to documents shown to Reuters, recorded video calls and court proceedings.",
      "The families of seven detainees interviewed by Reuters said they were not gang members and that they refused to sign the document.",
      "Nevertheless, hours later on Friday, April 18, they were loaded onto a bus bound for nearby Abilene Regional Airport, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and family members, before the bus was turned around and sent back to the detention center.",
      "That night, the Supreme Court\u00a0temporarily blocked\u00a0their deportations. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the halted deportations.",
      "It was a reprieve for the group of\u00a0Venezuelans\u00a0detained at Bluebonnet, who still face being potentially sent to CECOT, the notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration has sent at least 137\u00a0Venezuelans\u00a0under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, if the Supreme Court lifts the block.",
      "The Bluebonnet facility, located 200 miles (322 km) west of Dallas, is privately run by the Management and Training Corporation under a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Named after the state flower of\u00a0Texas, it has held an average of 846 detainees a day in fiscal year 2025, according to ICE detention data.",
      "Denied access to the Bluebonnet facility by ICE, Reuters flew a small plane over the center last week as well as a drone nearby on April 28 to gather aerial images of the detainees being held there. Some of the detainees photographed by Reuters were wearing red jumpsuits designating them as high-risk.",
      "Reuters photographed Diover Millan, 24, as he walked with four other men in the detention center\u2019s yard. Another Venezuelan, Jeferson Escalona, 19, was photographed playing soccer. Reuters identified three others by showing their photos to family members.",
      "Millan was moved to Bluebonnet in mid-April from the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, where he had been held since he was arrested by immigration agents in the Atlanta suburbs on March 12, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official. Reuters could not find a criminal record for Millan, who had been working in construction. The DHS official said Millan was a \u201cdocumented\u201d member of Tren de Aragua, but provided no evidence.",
      "The DHS official said ICE detained Escalona in January 2025, after he was arrested by local\u00a0Texas\u00a0police for evading arrest in a vehicle. He arrived at Bluebonnet after he was returned from the U.S. migrant detention facility in Guantanamo Bay in February.",
      "The DHS official said Escalona was a \u201cself-admitted\u201d Tren de Aragua member but did not provide evidence of the claim.",
      "During a phone interview from Bluebonnet, Escalona said he had no ties to Tren de Aragua or any gang. He was a police officer in Venezuela, he said. When they detained him, U.S. authorities took his phone and he suspects they saw photos of him making hand gestures that he said were common in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re making false accusations about me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t belong to any gang.\u201d",
      "Escalona said that he has asked to return voluntarily to Venezuela but was denied.",
      "\u201cI fear for my life here,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to go to Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of thousands of\u00a0Venezuelans\u00a0have come to the United States over the past few years, fleeing economic collapse and what critics call an authoritarian crackdown under President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Under the administration of former President Joe Biden, many were given temporary humanitarian protections that the Trump administration is trying to revoke.",
      "\u2018He is desperate'",
      "Since their aborted deportation, the men have been on edge, their families say.",
      "In Millan\u2019s dorm, he and some of the other Venezuelan men take turns sleeping so that they can alert family members if immigration officers come to deport them, according to Millan\u2019s wife, who asked not to be named for fear of being targeted by immigration officials.",
      "One day last week, he told her the men in the dorm refused to go out into the yard because they were worried they would be put on another bus and sent to El Salvador.",

      "In one recent video call, Millan told his wife that they haven\u2019t been given much food, and he tries to sleep more so that he is not so hungry, she said, something that other detainees\u2019 relatives echoed.",
      "A spokesperson for Management and Training Corporation, which runs the facility, said \u201call detainees housed at Bluebonnet receive meals based on a menu that has been approved by a certified dietitian, ensuring the recommended daily caloric intake is met.\u201d",
      "In a statement, DHS said it \u201cuses multiple strategies to manage capacity while maintaining compliance with federal standards and our commitment to humane treatment.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, April 26, an immigration official visited Escalona\u2019s dorm and answered some of the detainees\u2019 questions, according to an audio recording of the visit obtained by Reuters.",
      "The men, talking over each other frantically, wanted to know why the government was trying to send them to El Salvador and what was happening with their immigration court dates.",

      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t have a criminal record in the three countries in which I have lived in, how are they going to send me to El Salvador?\u201d one of the men in the recording asked. Reuters was not immediately able to establish his identity.",

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 LeBron James wasn\u2019t ready to make any decisions about his future in the painful moments immediately after his 22nd NBA season ended with the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 first-round playoff exit.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the answer to that,\u201d James said Wednesday night when asked how long he will continue to play. \u201cSomething I\u2019ll sit down with my wife and my support group and kind of just talk through it, and see what happens. Just have conversations with myself on how long I want to continue to play. I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now, to be honest.\u201d",
      "The 40-year-old James has given no public indication he is thinking about retirement this summer, but Lakers fans will be holding their breath until the top scorer in NBA history makes his plans official.",
      "James provided no hints after recording 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the Lakers\u2019 103-96 loss to Minnesota.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to me if I\u2019m going to continue to play, or how long I\u2019m going to continue to play,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately up to me, so it has nothing to do with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Most observers think the four-time champion is planning to return for a 23rd season, which would break the NBA longevity record he currently shares with Vince Carter. He is also just 49 regular-season games behind Robert Parish, who holds the NBA record with 1,611 games played. James already holds the league record for career playoff games with 292.",
      "But his seventh season with the Lakers is over after the Timberwolves\u2019 4-1 series victory. Los Angeles didn\u2019t build a winning dynamic quickly enough to the midseason arrival of Luka Doncic in a seismic trade for Anthony Davis.",
      "James\u2019 Lakers have advanced in the postseason just once in the five years since their championship in the Florida bubble \u2014 but if James returns, he\u2019s coming back to a completely reconfigured team built around his new partnership with Doncic.",
      "James and Doncic played only 21 games together after the deal, and it wasn\u2019t enough to maximize their potential teamwork. Another full year together could raise their partnership to formidable levels, and James still seems intrigued by the prospect of playing a full year or more alongside the Slovenian superstar he has described as his favorite active player.",
      "More Sports from NBC News",
      "The NBA playoffs have been especially contentious so far Tyrese Haliburton's dad confronted Giannis Antetokounmpo after Pacers eliminated the Bucks Luka Don\u010di\u0107 donates $5,000 to help restore Kobe and Gianna Bryant mural in L.A.

      "Bucks star Damian Lillard has a torn Achilles and is in doubt for next season",
      "\u201cAnytime you make a big acquisition in the middle of the season, it\u2019s always going to be challenging, not only for me, but for (Austin Reaves) and the rest of the group,\u201d James said. \u201cThere were times where we obviously didn\u2019t look so well, but I think we kind of figured it out later in the season, the more games we had. I still don\u2019t think we had enough time to mesh, but for the time that we had, I thought we ended the regular season very well to be top three in the West.\u201d",
      "Doncic isn\u2019t the only teammate who could compel James to return: His 20-year-old son, Bronny, is coming off a surprisingly solid rookie season with the Lakers in which they became the first father and son to play together in NBA history.",
      "Bronny James is hoping to carve out a bigger role alongside his father next season after getting sporadic playing time this year. LeBron said the chance to work alongside Bronny this season was the \u201cNo. 1\u201d accomplishment of his career.",
      "There are no apparent contractual or financial issues in James\u2019 way: He has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. That\u2019s serious money to leave on the table, even for a business mogul with a net worth estimated at more than $1 billion.",
      "An eighth consecutive season with the Lakers would be the longest stretch of his career with one team, surpassing his first seven seasons with Cleveland \u2014 although he returned for four more years and a championship with the Cavaliers.",
      "James\u2019 level of play remained high in his 22nd season, confounding all previous notions of basketball longevity. He averaged 24.4 points per game \u2014 his lowest since his rookie season, but just barely \u2014 along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds.",
      "James remained the Lakers\u2019 heart while they won 52 games and the Pacific Division title despite the midseason roster upheaval. Every significant contributor on this season\u2019s roster is under contract for 2025-26 except for Dorian Finney-Smith, who has a $15.3 million player option, and inconsistent center Jaxson Hayes.",
      "In a moment of reflection near his 40th birthday last December, James speculated that he could continue to play at this level for five to seven more years. He doesn\u2019t intend to stick around that long, however."

    "summary": "A $26 million federal program to help residents of Lowndes County, Alabama, who have dealt with inadequate sewage systems for decades was stopped by an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "For the last 14 years, when it rains in Lowndes County, Alabama, contaminated standing water builds up around Annye Burke\u2019s home. When the septic tank breaks down, raw sewage backs up into her toilet, she said.",
      "Although \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the unhealthy and inconvenient conditions, Burke said she doesn\u2019t let it get her down. Human wastewater contaminating homes and yards in these rural parts of central Alabama \u201chas become a way of life,\u201d she said. The problem has existed so long and was  so pervasive that a 2017 study determined 1 in every 3 adults in the county had the intestinal parasite hookworm.",
      "The Biden administration investigated and allocated nearly $26 million to rebuild Lowndes County\u2019s water infrastructure, with the Department of Justice declaring the majority-Black area was suffering from \u201cenvironmental racism.\u201d",
      "But earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to kill the deal, calling it \u201cillegal DEI.\u201d",
      "The DOJ\u2019s Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights under Trump, said the agency \u201cwill no longer push \u2018environmental justice\u2019 as viewed through a distorting, DEI lens,\u201d referring to diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "A 2023 investigation sparked by environmental activist Catherine Coleman Flowers and conducted by the DOJ found that low-income residents of the county, most of whom are Black, have lacked basic sanitation services for generations. Given the area\u2019s especially hard, impermeable soil and the high cost of installing private wastewater systems, many residents have resorted to straight piping to deal with human wastewater. This method involves guiding human wastewater away from the home into a series of ditches and crude piping systems, according to the DOJ report. That water collects in nearby yards, open areas and woods.",
      "In more recent years, heavier rainfall related to climate change has meant that contaminated water floods into the home, spills across open areas, and contaminates local vegetation and water, exposing residents to illness.",
      "And so, Burke and more than 300 other families in Lowndes County \u2014 located about 40 miles southwest of Montgomery \u2014 are forced to live with a failing water infrastructure that has led to serious health concerns, including hookworm, which at one point had been thought to be eradicated from the United States, according to a 2021 study by the Baylor College of Medicine and the Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise.",
      "Hookworms are mainly contracted by walking barefoot on soil contaminated with infected feces. It can cause abdominal pain, skin rashes, diarrhea, fever and other ailments.",
      "\u201cWe have to be extra sanitary because people getting sick can be a problem,\u201d Burke, 58, said. \u201cThe health concerns are real. In 2025 we shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this, but it is what it is.\u201d",
      "She said she uses various disinfectants multiple times a day to clean her home and protect her family, which includes her children and grandchildren who come to visit.",
      "This environmental quagmire has persisted for more than 20 years in this rural part of the state, where 72.4% of the population is Black and the median household income is $35,160, according to the latest census; one-third of residents live below the poverty line. Flowers said that much of the problem started back in 1866 with the passage of the Southern Homestead Act, when Black people were first allowed to purchase land there and were offered mostly places that were environmentally unsafe.",
      "In recent decades, it\u2019s not uncommon for untreated sewage to flow from some residents\u2019 toilets into their yards or back up into their homes through sinks or bathtubs. Drinking water from the tap is out of the question. Some residents have dug ditches in an attempt to drain rainwater away from their homes.",
      "Flowers, who grew up in Lowndes, has been fighting for 23 years to fix the water infrastructure in the county. Her efforts led to the Biden administration\u2019s $26 million commitment. She said Trump\u2019s cancelation of the agreement did not surprise her.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who are not going to make it a priority to get this work done,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been.\u201d",
      "Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell, a Democrat who represents the area, said in a statement that the DOJ\u2019s reason for abandoning the deal was weak.",
      "\u201cThis agreement had nothing to do with DEI,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cIt was about addressing a public health crisis that has forced generations of children and families to endure the health hazards of living in proximity to raw sewage, as the DOJ itself documented. By terminating it, the Trump Administration has put its blatant disregard for the health of my constituents on full display.\u201d",
      "When announcing the results of the 2023 investigation, former Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said the Justice Department found evidence that suggested Alabama\u2019s Department of Public Health showed \u201ca consistent pattern of inaction and/or neglect concerning the health risks associated with exposure to raw sewage.\u201d",
      "Sewell added that the burden to \u201cremedy this injustice\u201d fell to the Alabama Department of Public Health. But the ADH said in a statement to NBC News that \u201cthe installation of sanitation systems and related infrastructure is outside the authority or responsibilities.\u201d",
      "A second statement from ADH said the department had received $1.5 million of the funds from the Biden agreement and used it in part to pay for three septic tank installations. With the remainder of that money, ADH will pay a contractor to complete more work by May 2026, according to the statement. Trump killed the agreement before any additional funds could be distributed toward fixing the water infrastructure.",
      "Annye Burke said her daughter, who lives next door, is in a dilemma because she was hoping to receive a new septic tank when hers recently collapsed. She\u2019s lived the last four years with her water issues.",
      "\u201cBeing raised in the country and at one point of having to use outside facilities, I know how to make do,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI just take one day at a time and pray about it and keep moving on. I don\u2019t let it get me down. But my daughter grew up differently, so I worry about how she deals with this stuff.\u201d",
      "Flowers, the activist, said that while she hopes the agreement will be reinstituted, she has seen communities come together to make change. Last week, she pointed out, she was in Mount Vernon, New York, where sewage issues were resolved with the combined work of the city, county and state government.",
      "\u201cThey fixed it because they should have,\u201d Flowers said. The problem was discovered in 2021\u00a0 \u201cand it\u2019s fixed five years later. I\u2019ve been working on this in Lowndes County since 2002.\u201d",
      "Some families have been able to afford to move away, but many cannot. Then the connection to the land is also a factor, said Flowers, who spent her childhood there and whose father was raised in Lowndes County.",
      "\u201cMy family has been in Lowndes County since slavery,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cIt\u2019s home for people. Why would we want to move? That\u2019s where our people are buried.\u201d",
      "Changing homes is not just about occupying another house.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about giving up a culture,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we will continue this fight.\u201d"

      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",
      "Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and\u00a0move to a beat\u00a0aside from humans,\u00a0parrots\u00a0and some\u00a0primates. But then there\u2019s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the\u00a0meaning of music.",
      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",
      "Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
      "What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.",
      "\u201cScientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners \u2014 like humans and parrots \u2014 could learn to find a beat,\u201d said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico\u2019s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.",
      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",
      "To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",
      "Ronan was the top diva.",
      "\u201cNo human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\u201d said Cook, adding that \u201cshe\u2019s much better than when she was a kid,\u201d indicating lifetime learning.",
      "The new study confirms Ronan\u2019s place as one of the \u201ctop ambassadors\u201d of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",

      "If the next pope is from sub-Saharan Africa, he would be the first in Catholic Church history. Catholic Africans think it is a long shot, though some are cautiously optimistic that Pope Francis\u2019 successor could be a Black cardinal from their continent.",
      "The answer will come soon, as the cardinals eligible to elect the new pope open their conclave next Wednesday at the Sistine Chapel.",
      "Who are the Africans considered \u2018papabile\u2019?",
      "At least three African cardinals are among those currently cited as \u201cpapabile,\u201d the term used by Vatican observers to describe possible contenders to lead the Catholic Church.",
      "They are Cardinals Robert Sarah of Guinea, Peter Turkson of Ghana and Fridolin Ambongo of Congo.",
      "If any of them is selected, he would be the first African pope in more than 1,500 years and the first ever from sub-Saharan Africa. That historical record makes many in Africa eager for change \u2014 but not overly hopeful.",
      "Before the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI, there was much media attention around Francis Arinze, a highly respected cardinal born in Nigeria, raising questions even then about whether the world was ready for a Black pope from Africa.",
      "A continent where Catholicism is growing",
      "Two decades later, Catholicism continues to decline in Europe while it grows in the developing world. The number of Catholics is growing faster in Africa than anywhere else.",
      "At least 20% of global Catholic community is in Africa, which \u201cis characterized by a highly dynamic spread of the Catholic Church,\u201d according to a recent Vatican report.",
      "Some say having a pope from Africa, or Asia \u2014 which is also seeing strong Catholic growth \u2014 would signal a powerful message of inclusion. But as Francis\u2019 papacy showed, inclusive efforts can alienate many others and even breed dissent.",
      "The three possible papal candidates from Africa \u2014 Sarah, Ambongo, and Turkson \u2014 are seen as holding orthodox views on some of the hot-button issues that the Catholic Church is grappling with, reflecting wider social conservatism on the continent of 1.3 billion people. Catholic orthodoxy in Africa was at odds with Pope Francis\u2019 pastoral vision of mercy and understanding for all marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ Catholics.",
      "The real-life situation was reflected in the fictional Oscar-nominated film \u201cConclave,\u201d in which one of the four contenders vying for the papacy was a socially conservative cardinal from Nigeria.",
      "What stances have the African contenders taken?",
      "Congo has the highest number of baptized Catholics in Africa.",
      "Ambongo \u2014 the archbishop of Congolese capital, Kinshasa, since 2018 \u2014 last year signed a statement by the conference of African bishops rejecting a Vatican declaration to allow priests to offer spontaneous, non-liturgical blessings to same-sex couples seeking God\u2019s grace.",
      "That statement, seen as a rebuke of Francis, asserted that same-sex unions were \u201ccontrary to the will of God.\u201d It cited biblical teaching condemning homosexuality and asserted that same-sex relations are \u201ccontradictory to cultural norms\u201d in Africa.",
      "But it is Sarah, the Guinean cardinal who is the Vatican\u2019s former liturgy chief, who posed a more public challenge to Francis.",
      "A favorite of traditionalists, Sarah prefers silent prayer and is an adherent of the old Latin Mass. He is a staunch defender of longstanding doctrinal faith.",
      "After Francis in 2021 reimposed restrictions on celebrating the Latin Mass that Benedict had relaxed, Sarah responded with tweets quoting Benedict\u2019s original 2007 law to relax the restrictions. His posts were accompanied by a photo of Benedict wearing the red cape that Francis had eschewed the night of his election.",
      "A year earlier, Sarah had orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading Benedict to co-author a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when Francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the Amazon. As the scandal grew, Benedict removed himself as a co-author.",
      "Sarah, 79, officially retired in 2021 but remains eligible to attend the conclave. Since the death of Francis on April 21, he has emerged as a favorite of European traditionalists who want to see a reversal of Francis\u2019 progressive policies.",
      "For many Africans, Pope Francis was beloved",
      "But in Africa, where Francis was widely loved for his engagement with the continent\u2019s crises, many Catholics simply want a pope who will be a faithful leader for everyone.",
      "\u201cFor us, it does not matter whether he is African, white, or Black. What matters is having a good, holy pope who can unite Catholics across the world,\u201d said Luka Lawrence Ndenge, an emergency officer with the Catholic charity Caritas in the remote town of Wau in South Sudan.",
      "The father of two said he believes an African can rise to the papacy, especially as \u201cwe already have African cardinals who are fully capable.\u201d",
      "Bishop Tesfaselassie Medhin, primate of Adigrat in the Ethiopian region of Tigray, said he hopes the next pope will be as compassionate as Francis, who repeatedly called attention to war in Tigray in 2021 and 2022.",
      "But the prospect of having a Black African pope is exciting, he said.",

      "A woman has sued American Airlines, claiming she was sexually assaulted on a domestic flight last year by a man previously reported to the airline for sexual abuse allegations.",
      "Barbara Morgan, of California, says she was sexually assaulted on a April 24, 2024, red-eye flight from San Francisco to Dallas, according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California last week.",
      "The suit accuses American Airlines of putting profits over passenger safety and that her alleged assailant, Cherian Abraham, was allowed to fly even though the airline had a notice of a 2023 sexual assault charge against him, the suit said.",
      "Even after reporting the assault, Morgan said she was left traumatized when the airline allegedly ignored her and victim-blamed her.",
      "An attorney for Abraham did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. American Airlines said Thursday that Abraham will no longer be allowed to fly with the airline.",
      "\"The safety of our customers and team members is our highest priority. We take this matter very seriously and are working closely with law enforcement on its investigation,\" the airline said in a statement.",
      "The suit states that Morgan took the flight for a trip to celebrate her son\u2019s new job and home in Dallas.",
      "She was placed in a middle seat next to Abraham, who was \"previously reported to American Airlines for allegations of sexual abuse against a female passenger,\" according to a news release by her attorneys, Romanucci & Blandin.",
      "He allegedly sexually assaulted her during the flight as the cabin lights were dimmed and she yelled at him to \"stop\" twice, the lawsuit says.",
      "However, no American Airlines employee intervened or made an effort to investigate the incident. It unfolded as most passengers were asleep, wearing headphones, or were unaware of the assault, the lawsuit says.",
      "She reported the abuse as soon as she got off the plane and pointed out her assailant, the lawsuit says. But instead of getting help, she felt rebuffed.",
      "\"The American Airlines gate agent engaged in victim-blaming, questioning why Plaintiff had not taken further action to report the assault during the flight,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "Morgan explained that she was scared he'd retaliate against her, that it was challenging to report the assault while confined to her seat and that she was afraid the plane might be rerouted, potentially angering other passengers, the lawsuit says.",
      "The gate agent stated that there was nothing they could do and advised Morgan to file a complaint on their website.\u00a0The lawsuit states that she made the complaint on the same day and received a generic response indicating that someone would follow up, but no one did.",
      "On April 30, 2024, she submitted a complaint to the Director of Customer Relations, Vice President of Reservations and Service Recovery, and the CEO of American Airlines.\u00a0She again received an automated response, but \"no meaningful engagement or support,\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "In May, a representative of American Airlines contacted Morgan by phone, and the representative allegedly again \"shifted blame onto her for not reporting it while still in the air,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "Morgan only learned that Abraham had prior reports of sexual violence on an American Airlines flight when the FBI contacted her and said he was charged, her attorneys said.",
      "In March this year, Abraham was charged\u00a0with one federal count of abusive sexual contact out of the Western District of Washington \"for his subsequent sexual assault of another American Airlines female passenger,\" the lawsuit said. That unwanted touching incident unfolded on March 18.",
      "The charge referenced previous sexual assaults on flights by Abraham, including Morgan's, and noted the first report was made in 2023 before Morgan's flight.",
      "Morgan's lawsuit was filed against American Airlines and Abraham. It accuses the airline of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraudulent concealment. It also accuses Abraham of sexual battery, gender violence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.",
      "\"The FBI and American Airlines passengers have repeatedly warned the airline that inflight sexual assaults are occurring on American Airlines flights\u2014and American Airlines has had every opportunity to take those warnings seriously. Instead, they\u2019ve turned a blind eye, leaving passengers vulnerable at 30,000 feet. This isn\u2019t just a failure of policy; it\u2019s a failure of basic responsibility,\" Patrick J. Driscoll, an attorney for Morgan, said in a Wednesday statement.",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. \u2014 A cybercrime expert with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation testified Wednesday that a former Memphis police officer charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols took a cellphone photo of Nichols as he struggled with serious injuries.",
      "TBI Special Agent Derek Miller testified in the trial of Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty to state charges including second-degree murder. They already face the prospect of years in prison after they were\u00a0convicted of federal charges\u00a0last year.",
      "Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a January 2023 traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother near his home.",
      "Footage of the beating\u00a0captured by a police pole camera\u00a0also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. His death led to nationwide protests, calls for police reforms in the U.S., and intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, a majority-Black city.",
      "Photo was shared 11 times",
      "Video shows Haley taking a photo of Nichols, who was seated on the ground and leaning against a police car after the beating. Haley shared the photo 11 times and had text conversations with eight people about it, Miller said.",
      "The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. Prosecutors have argued that the officers had a duty to intervene and stop the beating and tell medical personnel that Nichols had been struck in the head, but they failed to do so.",
      "Former Memphis officers Desmond Mills Jr. and Emmitt Martin also were charged in the case. They have agreed to plead guilty to the state charges and are not standing trial. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.",
      "Ex-officer acknowledges duty to intervene",
      "Defense attorneys have sought to chip away at accusations that the officers used unnecessary force to subdue Nichols. They\u2019ve argued that Nichols was actively resisting arrest by running away and failing to give his hands to officers so that he could be handcuffed. They also have argued that their use of force complied with police department policies.",
      "Mills testified Tuesday that he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols\u2019 death three days later from\u00a0blunt force trauma.\u00a0Dr. Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, testified Wednesday that Nichols suffered tears and bleeding in the brain.",
      "As Nichols struggled with Bean and Smith, who were holding him on the ground, Mills pepper-sprayed Nichols and hit Nichols three times in the arm with a police baton, he said. Martin punched and kicked Nichols in the head, and Haley also kicked Nichols.",
      "Defense testimony begins",
      "Wednesday afternoon, defense attorney Martin Zummach questioned TBI Special Agent Charles Baker, who testified that Nichols\u2019 car was searched after the beating and authorities found credit cards, debit cards and identifications that did not belong to Nichols.",
      "Meanwhile, Kelli Rogers, a resident of the Memphis suburb of Arlington, testified that her wallet containing her ID and credit cards was stolen from her car in 2022. Rogers said she was recently informed that one of her credit cards was found in the car and that she did not know Nichols.",
      "Officers who pulled Nichols over said they did so because he was speeding and driving recklessly, but they did not know about the items found in his car.",
      "Hagerman, the prosecutor, asked Baker if the discovery of the IDs and credit cards influenced how the TBI investigated the assault case.",
      "\u201cSay everything in that car was stolen, it still has no bearing on the seriousness of the case I was asked to investigate,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Zummach then asked Baker if it was reasonable to conclude that Nichols was resisting arrest and wanted to get away from the vehicle because he may have had \u201cevidence of crime in his car.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt could be,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Baker also testified that mushrooms containing the hallucinogen psilocybin were found in the car. Ross, the medical examiner, testified Nichols did not have the hallucinogen in his system.",
      "Former Memphis officer Preston Hemphill, who was at the traffic stop but not the location of the beating, testified that he heard Martin say \u201clet go of my gun\u201d after Nichols was forcibly removed from his car. It is not clear in the video whether Nichols actually tried to grab Martin\u2019s gun.",
      "Hemphill said that statement increased the risk to officers \u201cas high as it could go.\u201d",
      "Hemphill fired his Taser at Nichols during the traffic stop. After Nichols fled, Hemphill could be heard on his body camera video saying: \u201cI hope they stomp his ass.\u201d",
      "Hemphill was fired from the police force but was not criminally charged."

      "STARKE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 An Army combat veteran whose Gulf War experience triggered severe mental problems is\u00a0scheduled to be executed\u00a0Thursday in Florida for the shotgun killings of his girlfriend and her three young children in 1998.",
      "Barring a last-minute reprieve, Jeffrey Hutchinson is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. Thursday at Florida State Prison near Starke. The execution, if carried out, will be the fourth in Florida this year under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, with a\u00a0fifth execution planned for May 15.",
      "Hutchinson, 62, has long claimed he is innocent and that two unknown assailants perpetrated the killings as part of a U.S. government conspiracy aimed at silencing him over his activism on claims of Gulf War illnesses and other issues affecting veterans. Hutchinson served eight years in the Army, part of it as an elite Ranger.",
      "Court records, however, show that on the night of the murders in Crestview, Florida, Hutchinson had argued with his girlfriend, 32-year-old Renee Flaherty, then packed his clothes and guns into a truck. Hutchinson went to a bar and drank some beer, telling staff there that Flaherty was angry with him before leaving abruptly.",
      "A short time later, a male caller told a 911 operator \u201cI just shot my family\u201d from the house Hutchinson and Flaherty shared with the three children: 9-year-old Geoffrey, 7-year-old Amanda, and 4-year-old Logan. All were killed with a 12-gauge shotgun that was found on a kitchen counter. Hutchinson was located by police in the garage with a phone still connected to the 911 center and gunshot residue on his hands.",
      "At his 2001 trial, Hutchinson based his defense on a claim that two unknown men came to the house, killing Flaherty and the children after he struggled with them. A jury found Hutchinson guilty of four counts of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to life in prison for Flaherty\u2019s killing and three death sentences for the children.",
      "Since then, Hutchinson has undertaken numerous unsuccessful appeals, many focused on mental health problems linked to his Army service. In late April, his lawyers sought to delay his execution date by claiming Hutchinson is insane and therefore cannot be put to death.",
      "Bradford County Circuit Judge James Colaw rejected that argument.",
      "\u201cThis Court finds that Jeffrey Hutchinson does not have any current mental illness,\u201d Colaw said in his April 27 order. \u201cThis Court finds that Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s purported delusion is demonstrably false. Jeffrey Hutchinson does not lack the mental capacity to understand the reason for the pending execution.\u201d",
      "In their court filings, Hutchinson\u2019s lawyers said he suffers from\u00a0Gulf War Illness\u00a0\u2014 a series of health problems stemming from the 1990-1991 war in Iraq \u2014 as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia related to his claim that he was targeted by government surveillance.",
      "One of his lawyers, Chelsea Shirley, said Hutchinson has \u201ca decades-long delusion that he is being executed to silence his efforts to expose government secrets. Two experts have concluded that he is not competent for execution. Based on these facts, we believe the court was wrong to find Mr. Hutchinson competent to be executed, but we are not surprised.\u201d",
      "Florida\u2019s lethal injection protocol uses a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",
      "So far this year,\u00a014 people have been executed in the U.S., including three in Florida, with Hutchinson to become the fourth. A fifth Florida execution is scheduled May 15 for Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing a woman at a motel in 1997. Rogers was also convicted of another woman\u2019s murder in California and is believed by investigators to have killed others around the country."

      "Laura Day saw her friend Demi Moore\u2019s second pregnancy coming. Moore wrote about the prediction in the introduction to Day\u2019s 1996 book, \u201cPractical Intuition,\u201d calling the intuitive a \u201cremarkable woman with a remarkable abilities.\u201d",
      "Day\u2019s debut was a handbook for \u201crediscovering\u201d intuition, as she put it, and seeing its transformative power firsthand. Thirty years later, Day continues to publish books that distill her unique perspective on the world into gifts for her readers.",
      "Her latest, \u201cThe Prism,\u201d out April 29, is a series of exercises of how people can identify where they need changes. \u201cThis is the framework for how you build yourself to build a life that you want,\u201d Day tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThe Prism\u201d by Laura Day",
      "\"The Prism\" by Laura Day",
      "She\u2019s written bestsellers on teaching intuition \u2014 but books, she says, are not how she pays the bills.",
      "A working intuitive, Day uses her abilities to guide companies\u2019 investing decisions and says she is on retainer at several companies (four, to be precise).",
      "She also gives regular readings for her coterie of famous friends, including actors like Moore (the two are still close, she says) and Brad Pitt, who blurbed the book.",
      "Day's husband, the writer and former skeptic Steven Schiff, chimes in during the interview to give instances of telepathy, detailing a time he helped a friend track down a cat states away.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s very generous when she thinks everyone can do this. I think almost nobody can do what she does. Yeah can she teach people to be in touch? Yeah. And have I also seen her like, bring out gifts that people didn\u2019t know? Oh yeah,\u201d he says, counting himself among them.",
      "While she\u2019s made a living, and a good one, by making individualized predictions, she shirks the label \u201cpsychic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did not want to be known as a psychic,\u201d she says, sharing that she only wrote her first book because she \u201chad to\u201d make \u201ca lot of money very quickly\u201d while raising her son. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write books about intuition. I definitely did not want my face on those books. I come from a family of three generations of scientists.\u201d",
      "Speaking of family, \u201cThe Prism\u201d also gives insight into the making of an intuitive mind. Day gets into the her harrowing upbringing, the oldest of four children to, what she describes as, a narcissistic father and a manic-depressive mother. Her parents bought an adjoining New York apartment to house their children. Essentially raising her younger siblings, Day writes she was aided by the \u201cimaginary friends\u201d who never went away.",
      "Day went on to lose her mother and two of her siblings to suicide. She\u2019s come to think of her intuition as the compass she used to make decisions, using information that did not come from within her but was given to her.",
      "\u201cWhy did I survive? I realized that intuition gave me a framework for what a healthy human being was and how that healthy human being should interface with the structure of the world. But it was so subconscious, and it gave it to me because I had three younger children to take care of,\u201d she says.",
      "She says people are their own \u201cmagic wands,\u201d and her books are meant to teach people how to use their own abilities rather than outsource them.",
      "\u201cTelling the future? That\u2019s a really good skill, and it\u2019s been helpful for me, and certainly I\u2019ve made a career of it. But more important is being able to change your present so you can change that future,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, Day opens up about her latest book \u2014 and why she says it\u2019s her last self-help.",
      "People who become very successful are very intuitive, but they\u2019re often intuitive in little parts of their lives. So, some of the other parts of their lives sometimes crumble around them. They need to be intuitive, because intuition is a survival skill. And what people don\u2019t realize about celebrities: you are always under attack. Even if they\u2019re beloved, they live in a hostile world.",
      "I really feel like \u201cThe Prism\u201d is the answer to, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d And, \u201cHow do I make it right? What\u2019s wrong with my life, and how do I make it right?\u201d The answer is never inside of you. We\u2019re held together by our patterns, but our patterns are also our jailers. They keep us stuck. You have to try something new on something you cannot think outside the box. You are the box. You can only imagine from what you\u2019ve been exposed to. You can intuit something else, though, and this book has a lot of different ways, again, to find the little alleys in your conscious mind where intuition can be found.",
      "My former books are very much about intuition, right? \u201cThe Prism\u201d really is about life. It\u2019s so important to me, and it is my last self-help book. I\u2019m writing memoir next.",
      "Yes, and I have no boundaries, so I often just give them the answers. But I find that there you can give somebody the answer and they don\u2019t do that much for you. That\u2019s why \u201cThe Prism\u201d gives you tiny behavioral shifts. Your world will change, and then you\u2019ll change as a result of your opportunities will change and your health.",
      "I very rarely don\u2019t say anything. That\u2019s why I always know my friends are doing something they shouldn\u2019t be doing when they don\u2019t call me. Because I have, you know, I have learned to have more of a filter. Believe me, I was not popular in third grade.",
      "I find the solution and I find the solution that they can do. And that\u2019s what \u201cThe Prism\u201d is about. Because a solution that someone can\u2019t do is not a solution. It takes more baggage. I find the solution that they can do, and then I give them a timeline so they can experience that.",
      "What I\u2019ll also sometimes do is see something coming up or someone coming up that will mitigate the pain, and then I\u2019ll say a couple things that are going to happen between now and then, so that they can verify it.",
      "Knowing the answers leads to \u2014 I mean, listen, I think the most courageous thing is to be human. It takes a lot of courage to be an aware human being. Seeing the future can be really scary because there are some things you can\u2019t do anything about. There\u2019s a lot you can and my precognition has saved my life quite a few times. But it\u2019s also let me know things that were too heartbreaking to know, and it also let me know too much so that I had to spend a lot of energy on repressing what I knew. Everything is a mixed bag. I am grateful for my gift."

      "While \"The Names\" is Knapp's debut novel, she's previously written a nonfiction book about a method of quilt-making, and she says she's been writing fiction longer than she's been quilting.",

      "\"So people will hear it before they meet with us, and probably bring a whole load of their own assumptions to that. It might influence whether we're get invited in for a job or meet a prospective partner or something like that,\" she adds. \"But then I was also interested in how it might shape our own sense of self.\"",
      "So enter Bear, Julian and Gordon. Knapp says she wanted to pick at least one more traditional name that could be handed down for generations, but that she was most interested in the associations that people could bring to each name.",

      "\"They're some of my favorite books, the ones look at family,\" she says. \"I guess that I am really interested in people and the things that make us us, and there's nothing that makes us who we are than our upbringing and the people we're surrounded by.\"",
      "Knapp, who has two children of her own, says her kids haven't asked about the meaning of their own names since reading her book, but that she was delighted that they picked it up.",

Because I think it at the outset, it looks like there\u2019s going to be some clear winners and losers in terms of who had the easier upbringing, and actually, to get to the end and feel like, actually, I\u2019m not sure who did.

      "Claude\u2019s devotion and anxiety add depth to the show\u2019s exploration of identity, intimacy and belonging.",
      "The series ends with a final dinner that echoes the group\u2019s last FaceTime with Nick. Wounds remain, but growth is visible. Jack (Will Forte) and Kate (Tina Fey) find their way back to each other. Danny accepts Claude\u2019s spirituality after a symbolic butterfly sighting. And Anne \u2014 perhaps the show\u2019s emotional anchor \u2014supports Ginny, who is pregnant with Nick\u2019s child.",
      "When asked if Anne is finally free from the expectations she once carried in her marriage, Kenney-Silver says: \u201cI think Anne lived to be needed. The idea that her entire marriage might have been a mirage was terrifying. But in that final moment with Ginny, she realizes two things can be true\u2014Nick loved Ginny, but he also loved her. The 25 years they shared were real.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not a perfect resolution \u2014 but it\u2019s honest. And that\u2019s what \"The Four Seasons\" does best: show that truth and messiness can coexist.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a love story to all sorts of long relationships\u2014including platonic ones. But yeah, not all marriages are meant to last forever. Some endings are necessary,\" writer Tracey Wigfield says."

      "A dusty country setting. Cowboy hats and printed shawls. A mighty delicious, generation-spanning family drama tied to property investments.",
      "No, this isn't \"Yellowstone.\" This is \"Ransom Canyon,\" Netflix's new Western based on the book series by the same name that author Jodi Thomas tells TODAY.com is actually very \"different than 'Yellowstone.'\"",
      "\"The men in (Ransom Canyon) are flawed and still love their family and land even when they are arguing,\" Thomas tells TODAY.com over email. \"This series has something for everyone.\"",
      "Thomas compliments the show, which premiered on April 17, particularly showrunner April Blair's depiction of the series, noting that she tells the story \"through a woman's gaze\" but the focus remains on \"character, family, love and legacy.\"",
      "\"It's about ranches and problems, but told in a different way,\" she says.",
      "Thomas says the way the series characters \u2014 particularly some of its leads like Staten Kirkland (Josh Duhamel), Quinn O'Grady (Minka Kelly) and Cap Fuller (James Brolin) \u2014 have come to life is exactly as she \"envisioned them\" when she wrote them, even if their plot lines differ from the books.",
      "One major change? In Thomas' novel, Quinn becomes pregnant. That plotline is omitted from the show.",
      "Minka Kelly tells TODAY.com that she didn\u2019t read the books since she knew the show would be headed in its own direction.",
      "\u201cI knew that April was going to be translating it in a really specific way, so I didn\u2019t read it,\u201d she says. \u201cI just really relied on the scripts and trusted the writers and used their words.\u201d",
      "Thomas, however, isn't upset by these changes. In fact, she adores the additions made to the tale.",
      "\"(Blair) turned these characters and my story into a compelling, bingeable series and I love the subplots and twists she\u2019s added,\" Thomas says. \"I wasn\u2019t involved, although I did get to visit the set and I had a wonderful time seeing my characters come to life. It was really a thrill and so impressive. Netflix has treated me and my book well.\"",
      "Whether its book or show, \"Ransom Canyon\" is full of romance, just as Thomas intended.",
      "Thomas, who says she \"fell in love at 17 and I've never stopped,\" likes writing romance because \"romance makes people feel good and gives them hope and we certainly could use more of that in the world.\"",
      "\"I would love to touch your heart and not just your mind,\" she continues. \"My wish is that my books and this show give people hope and good feelings and that\u2019s really the point of entertainment in my mind. At the end of the day we want to feel deeply and care.\"",
      "The main love story in the books and the show belongs to Staten and Quinn. Their romance comes from her belief that \"people love long and never stop.\"",
      "\"I've always written love stories because I really believe in the power of love,\" she says.",
      "Thomas believes Staten's character keeps people reading the books and watching the show as he gives you something to root for. When viewers first meet Staten in the show, he's a lonely rancher still grieving the loss of his wife and child.",
      "\"He was definitely a rich rancher, but he\u2019s lost all he really valued,\" Thomas says. \"I\u2019ve always written about people that have gone through a lot because that\u2019s where the really great stories come from. The reader cares deeply about such flawed characters and is rooting for them.\"",
      "Thomas, who has published over 50 books all set in Texas, comes from five generations of Texans. She says writing about the state is \"in (her) blood.\"",

      "Since Thomas has already penned eight books in the \"Ransom Canyon\" series, she hopes that the TV show gets greenlit for future seasons so some of her other characters have the chance to be brought to life and shine.",

      "While the series explores her relationship with her most recent set of adoptive parents, Antwon Mans (Jerod Haynes) and Cynthia Mans (Christina Hendricks), the show does not include depiction of recently surfaced allegations of abuse against the real-life Manses.",
      "A card at the end of the series briefly mentions the allegations, which emerged earlier this year in Season 3 of the Investigation Discovery documentary \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, multiple people who knew Grace and the Manses accused the family of physically and financially abusing Natalia and other children in their care.",
      "The Manses have denied these abuse claims. TODAY.com has reached out to the Mans family for comment and has not heard back.",
      "How does the show address allegations against the Mans family?",
      "A disclaimer at the end of \u201cGood American Family\u201d acknowledges the recently surfaced allegations.",
      "\u201cSince this series was completed, abuse allegations against Antwon and Cynthia Mans have come to light,\u201d the note reads. \u201cThey maintain their innocence, and to this day, so does (Grace\u2019s other former adoptive mother) Kristine Barnett.\u201d",
      "The show\u2019s creators have opened up about the abuse allegations, with executive producer Sarah Sutherland calling the claims against the Manses \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Natalia had been in a really bad state when Cynthia met her, and I think that there was a lot of love there. So it was really devastating to learn late after the fact, after we\u2019d been shooting, that there were these abuse allegations,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Sutherland says the show\u2019s plotline is \u201cvery specific to a certain time period\u201d and that the recently surfaced allegations \u201cdidn\u2019t affect the current time period we were covering.\u201d",
      "Creator Katie Robbins also notes that the show\u2019s ending, while it doesn\u2019t incorporate the latest real-life allegations against the Manses, captures what her team set out to achieve with the series.",
      "\u201cThe themes that we\u2019re grappling with are the elusive nature of truth and the pervasiveness of bias, and so ending the story where we do felt like the most potent way to get at those issues,\u201d she says.",
      "Hendricks has also shared her views on how the show handles the allegations against the real-life inspiration for her character, Cynthia Mans, acknowledging the challenges of fictionally portraying a story that is still unfolding in the real world.",
      "\u201cOur story ends before those allegations came. So we wanted to make sure that, as we were taking the audience on this sort of wild journey and looking at it from all these different angles, that it is a very set specific time, because this show could go on forever, right?\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cBecause it is an ongoing story,\u201d she continues. \u201cSo we had to make sure that there was, you know, a beginning, middle and end, so ours cuts off before those allegations.\u201d",
      "What are the Manses accused of?",
      "The most recent season of \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace,\u201d which aired in January, includes claims that the Manses financially exploited Grace over the years, alleging that Cynthia Mans made herself the payee of Grace\u2019s monthly benefit payments.",
      "The documentary includes footage from a 2014 FBI interview of Grace, in which she talks about signing over roughly $700 per month in benefits to her adoptive family, including 10% tithes to the church run by her adoptive dad, Antwon Mans.",
      "Another person interviewed in the documentary, Robert Madewell, whose son was previously cared for by the Manses, accuses the couple of being \u201cfraudsters\u201d and \u201cscammers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey adopt and get kids for money,\u201d he says in the docuseries. \u201cIt\u2019s not about love; it\u2019s all about the money, what they can get.\u201d",
      "The documentary also includes allegations that the Manses physically abused Grace and other children under their care.",
      "Anna Newlin, who had a child under the Manses\u2019 care at the time she was interviewed, told the documentary\u2019s producers that Grace \u201cused to get beat on all the time,\u201d and claimed the Manses were \u201cviolent\u201d toward Grace, alleging that they \u201chit her with a belt\u201d and \u201cknocked her down the stairs.\u201d",
      "Newlin walked back these claims in a subsequent interview and said the Manses have been falsely accused.",

      "Katy Perry wrote a long response to a fan-made ad congratulating her for finishing the first week of her \"Lifetimes\" tour, amid backlash about the tour and her recent trip to space.",
      "Perry responded to a video of the ad posted to a fan account on Instagram, writing in a comment that she is able to remain true to herself, \"heart open and honest,\" because of the bond she has with her fans.",
      "\"Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,\" she said. \"My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, 'No one can make you believe something about yourself that you don\u2019t already believe about yourself,' and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it\u2019s an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it.",
      "\"When the 'online' world tries to make me a human Pi\u00f1ata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed,\" she continued.",
      "Perry said that what is real to her is seeing her fans in the crowd every night, \"singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth.\"",
      "\"I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that,\" she said, adding an infinity emoji.",
      "\"I\u2019m not perfect, and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I\u2019m on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but\u2026 I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS,\" she added.",
      "Perry's comment came after her \"Lifetimes\" tour began on April 23 in Mexico City. The singer has since faced criticism for the show's choreography and stage design from social media users online.",
      "Earlier this month, Perry was also part of the all-female flight crew that took a roughly 10-minute trip to space aboard a Blue Origin spacecraft. The flight quickly garnered controversy, as everyday people, fast-food companies and celebrities, like Olivia Munn and\u00a0Emily Ratajkowski, questioned the sustainability of a trip to space.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Munn said while co-hosting TODAY With Jenna & Friends on April 3. \u201cIs it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it\u2019s a bit gluttonous. ... Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they going to do up there that has made it better for us down here?\u201d",
      "Perry did not directly respond to the criticism of the flight, but several of her fellow crew members like Lauren Sanchez, Gayle King and Aisha Bowe did during a press conference on April 14.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you steal our joy, but most people are really excited and cheering us on and realize what this mission means to young women, young girls and boys, too,\u201d King said.",
      "\u201cI feel anybody that\u2019s criticizing doesn\u2019t really understand what is happening here,\u201d she added, later in the press conference. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it, we\u2019ve all heard it and we were even all talking about that, and I hope that they will do a deep dive into what this represents.\u201d",
      "Sanchez, the fianc\u00e9e of Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, also shared her perspective.",
      "\u201cI get really fired up a little bit on this,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI would love to have them come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees that don\u2019t just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle. ... They love their work and they love the mission and it\u2019s a big deal for them.\"",
      "\u201cSo when we hear comments like that, I just say, \u2018Trust me. Come with me. I\u2019ll show you what this is about, and it\u2019s really eye-opening,\u2019\u201d she continued."

      "For the 10th anniversary of Elena Ferrante's \"Neapolitan Novels,\" publisher Europa Editions is releasing a special edition of the hailed  series, putting the four novels into one volume for the first time.",
      "TODAY.com can exclusively reveal the brand new cover of the special edition, set to publish Oct. 7, 2025.",
      "\"My Brilliant Friend\" first published in English in 2012, introducing readers to Lila and Elena, or Len\u00f9, and their complicated friendship from age 6 well into adulthood.",
      "Their relationship is spotlighted in the novel's three sequels, \"The Story of a New Name,\" \"Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay\" and finally, \"The Story of the Lost Child,\" which was published in English in 2015. All four were translated from Italian by Ann Goldstein.",
      "Ferrante, an anonymous Italian author, is also known for writing \"The Days of Abandonment.\" In 2024, the New York Times published a list of the 100 best books of the 21st century, and \"My Brilliant Friend\" topped the list at No. 1.",
      "Europa Editions Executive Publisher Michael Reynolds said in statement, \"This single-volume edition reflects more truly the author\u2019s conception of the story of Lila and Len\u00fa as one long saga.\"",
      "\"Designed and printed in Italy, this is going to be a beautiful object and a worthy celebration of an unforgettable, history-making work of literature,\" Reynolds said.",
      "The special edition consists of 1,248 pages. The new cover is typographic, spotlighting the opening lines of \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d in bright pink against a black background.",
      "\"My friendship with Lila began the day we decided to go up the dark stairs that led, step after step, flight after flight, to the door of Don Achille's apartment. I remember the violet light of the courtyard, the smells of a warm spring evening,\" the cover reads.",
      "Ginevra Rapisardi, who designed the new cover, told TODAY.com in a written interview that she wanted the cover \"to speak directly through the text, with a strong and immediate emotional pull.\"",
      "Initially, she said she attempted \"a few figurative and graphic attempts that didn\u2019t seem entirely convincing.\"",
      "\"It occurred to me that Elena Ferrante\u2019s true strength lies in her words, and that perhaps there was no need to add anything else,\" Rapisardi said. \"The opening of 'My Brilliant Friend' is wonderful and immediately evokes the tone and intensity of the story. It seemed a perfect \u2014 almost inevitable \u2014 solution.\"",
      "The goal of the color scheme was to achieve \"clear contrast,\" she said.",
      "\"It was important that the two colors stood in clear contrast, while still feeling harmonious and balanced \u2014 so that this chromatic dualism could, in some way, reflect the very nature of the novel,\" she said.",
      "The special edition notably achieves a very different look from the original covers. The original cover of \"My Brilliant Friend\" depicted a realistic wedding scene against the backdrop of a body of water. In the image, a bride and groom are walking away, followed by three young flower girls.",
      "The new cover aims to pay homage to the original covers through the colorful edges of the book.",
      "\"The image of the Gulf of Naples printed along the edges of the volume, which then continues onto the endpapers, is a clear homage to the original cover of 'My Brilliant Friend' and a visual element that evokes the heart of the story \u2014 its relationship with the city of Naples,\" Rapisardi said.",
      "Rapisardi said the design team also considered another \"iconic\" line from the books, \"You\u2019re my brilliant friend, you have to be the best of all, boys and girls,\" but noted it was \"quite short.\" Instead, those words can be found on the endpapers of the special edition, printed over the continued motif of the Gulf of Naples from the book's edges.",
      "The special edition, which is currently available for preorder for $65, is clothbound, and the words on the cover are \"hot-stamped,\" meaning they are engraved into the fabric, Rapisardi said.",
      "\"The legacy of 'My Brilliant Friend' is that of a universal story, one that has spoken to readers around the world with an authentic, profound, and powerful voice,\" Rapisardi said. \"The new cover aims to convey precisely that: the power of the written word.\""

    "summary": "Christie Brinkley sits down with TODAY.com to talk about her new memoir \"Uptown Girl\" and her 11-year marriage to music legend Billy Joel.",
    "story": [
      "Christie Brinkley, one of the most recognizable faces in modeling, offers a revealing glimpse into the challenges of being one of the world's original supermodels in her new memoir, \"Uptown Girl.\"",
      "Gracing the cover of more than 500 magazines and appearing in memorable movies like the 1983 hit film, \"National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\" Brinkley's career spans five decades, and she delves into much of it in her new book.",
      "\"I just want to tell some stories,\" Brinkley tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"I hope it'll be a nice diversion in a world that can use a good book every now and then, take you away on a little adventure.\"",
      "From being discovered at a payphone in Paris to being kicked out of Frank Sinatra's hotel room, \"Uptown Girl\" offers insight behind Brinkley's upbringing in Southern California and her ascent to the top of the modeling world. The book also explores her four marriages (and divorces), including 11 years she spent with Billy Joel.",
      "It's the music legend who penned \"Uptown Girl,\" the song that inspired the memoir's title, which has become Brinkley's enduring nickname \u2014 in spite of the fact that, according to the supermodel, it wasn't initially written for her.",
      "Brinkley writes in her memoir that it started out as a song for a \"mystery girl\" Joel had been having phone conversations with, but when his relationship with Brinkley began, he finished it in her honor. Their relationship was then immortalized in the hit song's iconic music video, in which Brinkley appears in.",
      "'Dancing in the kitchen' with Billy Joel",
      "In \"Uptown Girl,\" Brinkley, 71, opens up about her various heartbreaks, difficult early childhood with an abusive father and the helicopter accident that almost claimed her life in 1994. However, the model says that opening up about her marriage to Joel was the most difficult part of penning the memoir.",
      "\"The hardest thing to include was criticism of Billy, because I do care about my friendship with him,\" she says of the chapters that reveal Joel's heavy drinking and suggested affairs, which has been making headlines since her book came out.",
      "\"In the book, I feel like I balanced, very much, about how happy we were and how joy-filled our days were,\" she says of their marriage. \"It was literally dancing in the kitchen as we cooked, singing together, and making each other laugh. It was a beautiful, wonderful relationship.\"",
      "According to the memoir, that relationship became strained, in part, after Joel sued Frank Weber, his former manager, for having allegedly siphoned off his profits. It was a betrayal that Brinkley writes left Joel \"withdrawn and stressed\" as singer-songwriter felt immense pressure to recoup his financial loss.",
      "\"He was going through extraordinary circumstances in his life, things most people wouldn't ever have to deal with,\" she describes.",
      "Despite the vulnerable nature of the admissions, Brinkley says they were important to include in the memoir. \"I did have to go there because that was the reality.\"",
      "Brinkley tells TODAY.com that Joel had given his blessing to talk candidly about the ups and downs of their longtime relationship.",
      "\"He said, 'Just say what you need to say,'\" Brinkley recalls. \"And I think that's part of his healing, so I applaud him for all of that. It takes a lot of courage.\"",
      "The new memoir reveals some darker times in their relationship, including instances of Brinkley waking up in the middle of the night to discover Joel was missing, then him returning home in the wee hours of the morning after being out drinking all night.",
      "She also writes about the growing distance in their marriage that ultimately left her feeling \"lonely, despite the fact that he was right there.\" It was a loneliness so pervasive that Brinkley was thinking about Joel as she boarded a helicopter in Colorado, shortly after their separation in 1994, and wondered if the crooner would be worried about her embarking on a trip to go heli-skiing.",
      "\"For a moment I thought about my husband, Billy, whom I'd split with again, and hoping this trip to Telluride would wake him up to the reality that he might actually lose me,\" she writes.",
      "What she didn't know was that shortly after, the helicopter would crash into the San Juan mountains, leaving Brinkley and several companions temporarily stranded until they were rescued.",
      "Though Joel ultimately flew to her side and jetted her back to Long Island aboard a private plane, her dream of their reunion was dashed when she overheard him on the phone saying to an unknown caller, 'No, don't worry. I'm not going back to her. I just need to see her through this.'\"",
      "The revelation brought home the fact that their marriage was over. Two weeks later, they announced their divorce and as she penned in her memoir, \"the dream broke apart like debris.\"",
      "Despite their divorce, Brinkley tells TODAY.com that they still remain friends.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very loyal guy. He\u2019s loyal to his friends, he\u2019s generous. He just had a lot of stresses on him at the point when we were together and it just kind of came crashing down on us.\u201d",
      "'I was raised to be grateful'",
      "Outside of her marriage, the helicopter crash changed her life in other ways.",
      "\"I went through a phase of post-traumatic stress disorder,\" she says of the accident that left her clinging to the side of a mountain amid a pile of helicopter wreckage.",
      "\"One of the hallmarks is bad decision-making. And I made quite a few, which I lay out in the book and that chapter was hard to write just because I didn't want to think about any of (the helicopter crash). I didn't want to go back to that place. At the time when it happened, I actually thought it was so awful, I wanted to purge it from my body and from my memory banks.\"",
      "While she's endured her fair share of trauma, Brinkley remains the eternal optimist, both in love and life.",
      "\"I was raised in a very positive household, so I was raised to be grateful and counting my blessings and to know the good things that I have, no matter what,\" she says.",
      "Among those blessings are Brinkley\u2019s three children: Alexa Ray Joel, 39, her daughter with Joel, as well as her son, Jack Brinkley-Cook, 29, and other daughter, Sailor Brinkley-Cook, 26, both of whom she shares with her ex-husband Peter Cook.",
      "While appearing on the April 28 episode of TODAY, Brinkley shared that out of her three children, her oldest daughter is the one who's read most of her memoir and that she loves it.",
      "\"She was kind of blown away by it,\" said Brinkley.",
      "As for the other two, the model joked that her younger children \"skimmed through\" it and said, \"We know her!\" but otherwise, \"I don't think they understand the reason to read it.\"",
      "'This is not a revenge novel'",
      "Though Brinkley has released two other books, including a 1983 fitness book and \"Timeless Beauty,\" a wellness guide published in 2015, \"Uptown Girl\" is her first memoir, and she wants readers to take something positive away from her experiences.",
      "\"I just really hope people understand that the book is much more than rehashing divorces,\" she explains, referring to her other marriages to Jean-Francois\u00a0Allaux, Richard Taubman and Cook, all of which ended in divorce.",
      "\"This is not a revenge novel. It's filled with joy and when there are bad moments, it's sort of how to keep going and not let them pull you down,\" she says. \"And how to stay positive and maybe learn something from it or let it propel you into someplace that you didn't dare go before.\"",
      "CORRECTION\u00a0(April 30, 2025, 9:22 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated how long Christie Brinkley and Billy Joel were married. They were married for 9 years, not 11."

    "story": [
      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d has taken viewers on a journey, depicting Natalia Grace's story from her perspective, as well as her adoptive parents' Kristine and Michael Barnett points of view.",
      "The finale, which aired on April 30, showed the moments leading up to the Barnetts' trial for neglect of a dependent, as well as Michael Barnett having regrets over the way he and his ex-wife treated Natalia.",
      "Actor Mark Duplass tells TODAY.com that the final episode is one of his favorites because it includes a pivotal moment between Natalia (Imogen Faith Reid) and his character, Michael.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re speaking the language of television ... which is, two characters who have been through this amazing journey,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to sit on a bench together. And what does that mean to (viewers) from a TV and a cinematic standpoint?\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to work it out. They\u2019re going to come to understand each other\u2019s things. They\u2019re going to apologize to each other and get along and move on,\u201d he continues.",
      "\u201cAnd we don\u2019t get that.\u201d",
      "In real life, the Barnetts said that Grace, who has a rare form of dwarfism, was a grown woman pretending to be a child. They also accused her of threatening to kill their family, which Grace has denied.",
      "According to a court document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com, the couple had Grace psychologically and medically evaluated between 2010 and 2012, and successfully filed a petition to change her legal birth year from 2003 to 1989 to make her older.",
      "However, per a 2019 affidavit of probable cause, medical records indicated that Grace was not an adult. A Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital doctor determined Grace was 8 years old in 2010, and a 2012 skeletal survey from the same hospital stated she was 11.",
      "The real Michael Barnett admitted that he and his wife were aware of these results, yet still made Grace live alone in 2013 when they left to Canada with their biological children, according to the affidavit.",
      "After Grace was living with Cynthia and Antwon Mans, who later adopted her, the Barnetts were each charged with six counts of neglect of a dependent and two counts of conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent.",
      "Michael Barnett would go on to be acquitted of his charges in a 2022 trial, while Kristine Barnett\u2019s charges were later dismissed.",
      "And this is what the final episode of \u201cGood American Family\u201d loosely depicts.",
      "Natalia Grace and Michael Barnett's final conversation in 'Good American Family'",
      "In the show, Michael admits that he and Kristine knew Natalia was a kid. After losing the case, Natalia needs closure from Michael. She goes to his home and asks him if he knew that she was a child.",
      "\u201cWhy did you adopt me?\" she asks.",
      "Michael believes both he and Natalia were victims of Kristine\u2019s abuse, never admitting his faults. He shares that he always wanted a daughter and he wasn't a bad guy.",
      "\u201cBut Michael, I was a kid. You were supposed to be my dad,\u201d Natalia tells him, and at one point asks him to say that he hurt her.",
      "\u201cKristine hurt you,\u201d Michael says, looking away.",
      "Duplass tells TODAY.com that Michael isn't capable of admitting he messed up.",
      "\u201cMichael can\u2019t really get there because he\u2019s got so much damage and so much pain that I don\u2019t think he can possibly fathom the fact that (what) he has done to Natalia (was) not only as bad as what was done to him when he was a child, but probably worse,\u201d Duplass says.",
      "Duplass believes that Michael\u2019s \u201cmain goal was to do better for his children than he was done to,\u201d yet he failed.",
      "\u201cFor him to actually admit that would be too much. So I was really proud of the way that they wrote that scene. It felt very true and very real and very sad.\u201d",
      "How does Natalia and Michael's conversation compare to real life?",
      "On April 12, 2023, Grace and Michael Barnett filmed a reunion for the The Investigation Discovery docuseries \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\" The conversation aired in 2024.",
      "As Grace asks Michael Barnett multiple questions, including, \"Why did you adopt me in the first place?\"",
      "He seemingly avoids answering head on, saying, \u201cMany of these questions, there\u2019s not going to be a single answer to.\u201d",
      "Just like in \u201cGood American Family,\u201d he brings up Kristine Barnett\u2019s actions saying, \u201cI\u2019ve learned recently, you and I had the same monster: Kristine.\u201d",
      "He calls him and Natalia \u201cincredible victims\u201d of abuse, before claiming he was controlled, misguided and threatened by his ex-wife. He says she would tell him she would take their three biological children away and make sure he never saw them again.",
      "He also says that he tried to leave her and ended in the hospital multiple times.",
      "Kristine Barnett did not participate in the docuseries or respond to request for comment."

      "Matt and Serena's workplace will-they/ won't-they story took a slight turn in the Season 1 finale of \"St. Denis Medical.\"",
      "Season 1, Episode 18, titled \"This Place Is Our Everything,\" saw the emergency department at St. Denis Medical Center deal with overflow caused by a major storm. Supervising nurse Alex (Allison Tolman) tries to juggle both the demands of her job with the need to be by her husband's side during a procedure, while Joyce (Wendi McLendon-Covey) realizes she promised away all the hospital's latest funds in an effort to curry favor with the staff.",
      "One of the major causes of patient influx is a bachelorette party gone wrong, which nurses Matt (Mekki Leeper) and Serena (Kahyun Kim) take the lead on treating.",
      "Throughout Season 1, Matt and Serena's dynamic has been defined by lighthearted friendship, with a hefty amount of teasing (from Serena) and a poorly hidden crush (on Matt's part).",
      "But the finale episode, which aired April 29, reveals that all along, Serena had no idea about Matt's feelings for her. As Serena encourages Matt to ask out one of the bachelorette party patients, Matt starts to swallow the pill that his feelings are unreciprocated.",
      "The finale ends with Val (Kaliko Kauahi) confronting Serena about Matt's feelings for her \u2014\u00a0right after Matt tells the mockumentary cameras, \"Serena might be the girl of my dreams, but I am not the girl of her dreams \u2014\u00a0you know what I mean.\"",
      "Kahyun Kim tells TODAY.com she believes Serena genuinely didn't know how Matt felt about her. But as a viewer, she credits one scene with making her see the chemistry between her and Leeper's characters.",
      "\"There's this one scene that I \u2014 I don't know why, it just really is so adorable and cute to me and what really, really, me as an audience (member), sold Matt and Serena,\" Kim says.",
      "During Season 1, Episode 6, Serena spends most of the episode working on a special task with Joyce: trying to make St. Denis go viral on social media. Predictably, Joyce's overzealousness clashes with Serena's more plugged-in, trendy judgment.",
      "At one point in the episode, Serena vents about the day to Matt and shows him their video so far.",
      "\"Yeah, it's pretty good for a first try,\" Matt says.",
      "\"This was our 12th,\" Serena says, before adding, \"It'd be way easier if I was doing this with you. I could just boss you around.\"",
      "She proposes swapping assignments, trading working with Joyce for Matt's patient, who was injured after putting an engagement ring he planned to propose with somewhere he shouldn't.",
      "Matt refuses Serena's offer and cracks a joke about feeling \"emotionally invested\" in the outcome of his patient's NSFW injury. The two share a laugh and a smile.",
      "\"Matt makes a small little joke that makes Serena laugh, and ...\u00a0like Mekki's smile in that, it's so cute. It is so adorable. Like, it makes me sick,\" Kim jokes of watching the scene.",
      "Going into the already-renewed Season 2, Matt and Serena seem primed to continue down the path of the sitcom slow-burn couple, as the question of if they'll get together or not weighs over both fans of the show and the characters themselves.",
      "Below, Kim and Leeper discuss the mockumentary structure of \"St. Denis Medical,\" the scenes they struggled to get through without breaking character and what those final scenes mean for Matt and Serena.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Mekki Leeper: I think Matt, because of his 0% ability to mask or put on any kind of anything, is 100% himself. That is his only option.",
      "Kahyun Kim: I feel pretty same with Serena, too. I mean, not as much as Matt. I think Matt is definitely 100% himself. I think Serena is maybe 90% herself. And maybe there's a little 10% she has that she keeps private.",
      "I think all the characters are pretty themselves on the show.",
      "ML: Actually, I don't know, though, I think that Alex is aware of the camera in a way that's really interesting. I think that Val has like a world full of secrets \u2014",
      "KK: I was literally going to say \u2014",
      "ML: I think one of the most entertaining things about Val is that, Val is like, 'My life is none of the audience's f------ business,' which is so awesome about her character. Oh, and then, Wendi's character, Joyce, has the most complex relationship because she's doing PR also, always. So I think that's an interesting question, the authenticity of the characters.",
      "ML: For me, it is a tie, and for very different reasons. For me, it's Stephen (Schneider), Chaplain Steve. It's like, impossible. There's a scene where he gets in my face. In that scene where I'm trying to expose him for being a fake chaplain (in Episode 3). Dude, he's like, this close to my face in like five of those takes, and I couldn't do it. I felt really bad, because when somebody's doing brilliant work, the worst thing you can do is laugh in their face. But it was just too funny.",
      "And then also, (Kahyun) and I sometimes have this problem, not because we're trying to do really good comedy for each other, but because we hang out too much. When we're trying to have these more emotional beats \u2014 that's when we can't stop laughing, which is no good.",
      "KK: It's disgusting, and it's so hard.",
      "Definitely Mekki for me.",
      "KK: There's so many, it's so hard. But I would (laughs) have to say, when we were filming the pilot, and Wendi started doing cartwheels. It was our last day of filming, I think. I don't know what the direction exactly was from the writers, but it was like, 'Do a Wendi take.' I think it was something like that, or 'fun take.' And Wendi just started cheerleading for the office break room scene. And I just could not believe what was happening.",
      "ML: When she did a cartwheel for real, and we didn't know she was going to, and the gasp that's in the pilot of everybody in the room is totally real.",
      "I have, like, a ton. I love just getting to fall down on stuff. I think my favorite thing actually might be them letting me fall down more. Because similarly on the pilot, the first take that I think we shot of almost anything was, it's like me entering ... and I kept doing it falling down. And they were like, 'Hey, like, insurance, like, the lawyers are telling us you're not allowed to fall down. Don't do those kinds of jokes. Stop doing that.' (Laughs)",
      "KK: Did they actually say that?",
      "ML: Yes. Yeah they told me I had to stop falling down. But then over time, they're like, 'If he wants to fall down, like, let him do it then, fine.'",
      "KK: I think she's thinking, 'Ugh, him?' I think that's the first reaction. It's shocking. But I also think she, in that episode, she comes to the realization that he is indeed a good person. He is indeed a cute person. I think it just wasn't a possibility. The way I saw it, it didn't cross her mind. But, now that it has, it's like a little seed planted in her head.",
      "ML: I don't think that that's what he wants, but I do think that an event like what happened in the finale, it was kind of a refocusing thing. And he's like, I mean, it's literally what he says, it's like, I might be able to sort of date my job. And that's a big win.",
      "You know, can't get a girlfriend, but I do have a job, and I've barely I been able to do that the whole season, so it's pretty nice to start something.",
      "KK: (Laughing) I forgot that you say that.",
      "ML: When people are like, 'Hey, so we were thinking that you guys are maybe kind of as likable as the most likable TV couple in history \u2014\u00a0do you think you can be charming on that level?' It's a little like, 'No, man, I'm not John Krasinski, damn.' So it was nerve-wracking at first.",
      "But then, you know, they write these really brilliant characters, and you kind of focus more, I think for me, like I'm just being Matt. And then it becomes really natural. Like, oh, if I'm this kind of sheltered, nervous guy, it's very easy to figure out how he would be with Serena.",
      "But yeah, at first it was just kind of like, 'What are we going to do?'",
      "KK: Speak for yourself, because I was like, 'I got this.'",
      "ML: (Laughs)",
      "KK: I think it's fun. I think the writers do such a good job at establishing the characters. ... \u00a0It's different for me, because I think Serena really had no (idea). I don't have to play the crush. I don't have the romantic part yet.",
      "Now being Season 2, now that the awareness is there, I\u2019m wondering how different it will feel as Serena and as an actor.",
      "But, I mean, it's really easy. All jokes aside, it's really easy to act with Mekki ... It's like, so, so hard to watch, but at the same time, it's so cute. And I think Mekki does such a good job. He's so likable. Like, it's insane, because in real life, he's a terrible person. So it's crazy.",
      "ML: That is true. I really put it on. I lock in. Sometimes they do prosthetics to make me seem like a kind person. CGI, whatever it takes.",

      "\u201cAt the same time, a message was passed on to the Syrian regime \u2014 Israel expects it to act in order to prevent harm to the\u00a0Druze,\u201d they said.",

      "The violence spread to Sahnaya, another predominantly\u00a0Druze\u00a0area near the capital, on Wednesday. The Syrian health ministry said that 11 people were killed and others wounded there after \u201coutlaw groups\u201d targeted civilians and members of the state\u2019s General Security Service in Sahnaya.",
      "The violence was sparked by a voice recording cursing the Prophet Mohammad and which Sunni militants believed was made by a member of the Arab\u00a0Druze\u00a0minority. The Syrian Interior Ministry said on Tuesday it was investigating the origin of the recording and called for calm.",

      "\u201cIn the specific context of the current situation in the occupied Palestinian Territories, these obligations entail allowing all relevant U.N. entities to carry out activities for the benefit of the local population,\u201d Elinor Hammarskjold said.",
      "Palestinian representative Ammar Hijazi said Israel was using humanitarian aid as \u201ca weapon of war\u201d, while people in Gaza were facing starvation.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had submitted its position in writing to the hearings, which he described as a \u201ccircus\u201d.",
      "Speaking in Jerusalem on Monday, Saar said the court was being politicized, while the U.N. was failing to root out employees of its Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA who are members of Gaza militant groups.",
      "\u201cThey are abusing the court once again to try and force Israel to cooperate with an organization that is infested with Hamas terrorists,\u201d Saar said. \u201cThe goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself.\u201d",
      "The U.N. said in August that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 assault and had been fired. Another Hamas commander, confirmed by UNRWA as one of its employees, was killed in Gaza in October, according to Israel.",

      "Israel has repeatedly said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Hamas releases all remaining hostages. It has accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid, which the militant group denies.",
      "\u201cThis case is about Israel destroying the fundamentals of life in Palestine, while it blocks the U.N. and other providers of humanitarian aid from providing life-saving aid to the population,\u201d Hijazi, the head of the Palestinian mission to the Netherlands, told the hearing.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had\u00a0pushed\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow food and medicine into Gaza. Germany, France and Britain last week\u00a0called\u00a0to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.",
      "Advisory opinions of the\u00a0ICJ\u00a0carry legal and political weight, although they are not binding and the court has no enforcement powers.",

      "While the U.S. military had no immediate comment, the strike in Yemen\u2019s Saada governorate, a stronghold for the Houthis, would  renew questions from activists about the American campaign, known as \u201cOperation Rough Rider,\u201d which has been targeting the rebels as the Trump administration negotiates with their main benefactor, Iran, over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign. The strikes have drawn controversy in America over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks.",
      "\u201cTo preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,\u201d Central Command said. \u201cWe are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we\u2019ve done or what we will do.\u201d",

      "Before this week's federal election in Canada, Derek Ouellette and his wife, Yecenia Ouellette, could never have imagined voting for anyone but a Conservative.",
      "\u201cWe were both raised Conservative and we both kind of thought, Conservative is just what you do,\u201d Derek Ouellette, a 46-year-old insurance broker from Belle River, near Windsor, Ontario, said in a phone interview late Tuesday.",
      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",
      "His campaign, during which he focused on small-government and libertarian issues, combined with dissatisfaction at the scandal-hit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the economy to see the Conservatives move 24 points ahead of the Liberals in January, according to a poll tracker run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",
      "As anti-Trump sentiment grew across Canada, Poilievre's own bullish rhetoric rapidly lost its sheen for many Canadian Conservatives.",
      "When Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, was named Canada\u2019s interim prime minister and the Liberal candidate for the 2025 election, distaste for Trudeau and worries about the Liberals' ability to handle the economy quickly evaporated.",
      "When it did, a new way forward emerged for those who had felt politically homeless.",
      "Poilievre, now the former leader of the opposition, even lost the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades to a Liberal neophyte Monday.",
      "'Maple MAGA'",
      "\u201cListening to Poilievre speak, it\u2019s like talking points from Trump,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cIt just reeks of what\u2019s happening south of the border.\u201d",
      "By comparison, he added, Carney \u201chas shown himself to be very decisive in dealing with Trump\u201d by billing himself as candidate who could stand up to the president.",
      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",
      "Dugdale said she found parallels between Poilievre\u2019s campaign and support base, and Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement particularly off-putting.",
      "\u201cWe need unity. We need to be together. We need positive messaging,\u201d said Dugdale, who is from Barrie, just north of Toronto, and works in marketing and sales.",
      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",
      "And while lifelong Conservatives may have helped propel the Liberal leader forward, Paris said he believed \u201cMark Carney would likely not have won if not for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cCanadians were tired of the Liberal Party after 10 years, but they were even more concerned about Trump\u2019s threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dugdale pointed out, the election\u2019s projected outcome was a far cry from the Conservative victory that felt increasingly certain just weeks ago, with Poilievre now out of a job.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so ironic. Paul [Poilievre] was shouting, \u2018we need change,\u2019\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cHe got change alright.\u201d"

      "With 40,000 packed into Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, another 250,000 in the surrounding streets and millions more watching on TV and online, world leaders, including President Donald Trump, were reminded of Francis\u2019 central messages during his funeral Saturday.",
      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "Francis\u2019 casket was taken on a final journey in the so-called popemobile through the streets of Rome, past landmarks such as the Colosseum, to St. Mary Major Basilica, where he had chosen to be buried.",
      "The people lining the streets had come from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",
      "Nevertheless, despite scandal within the church and uncertainty without, there was plenty of Francis\u2019 platform that few would disagree with.",
      "Re reflected this while closing the homily: \u201cEmbrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.\u201d"

      "U.S. President Donald Trump indicated in February that he wanted access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth materials as a condition for continued U.S. support in the war, describing it as reimbursement for the billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has given to Kyiv. But talks stalled after a tense Oval Office meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian leaders, and reaching an agreement since then has proven difficult and strained relations between Washington and Kyiv.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the Trump administration was also ready to finalize the deal Wednesday.",

Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used to make electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet was expected to approve the agreement\u2019s text before it could be signed in Washington. The deal would then need to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it could take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington\u2019s push to stop the war.",
      "In Moscow, a senior Kremlin official said Wednesday that clinching a deal to end the war \u201cis far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d as the U.S. labors to bring momentum to peace efforts and expresses frustration over the slow progress.",

      "Connon also works for biotechnology company Lab-Grown Leather, which is developing the project with Dutch creative agency\u00a0VML and genomic engineering firm The Organoid Company.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re unlocking the potential to engineer leather from prehistoric species, starting with the formidable T-Rex,\u201d added Connon, who is one of the project\u2019s leaders.",
      "Connon and his colleagues may be eyeing the fashion industry \u2014 market data provider Fortune Business Insights says the global $500 billion leather goods market will be worth $855 billion by 2032 \u2014 and sectors beyond, such as the automotive industry.",
      "But experts say the chances of their achieving results anytime soon look less than likely. When they do commercially produce lab-grown T. rex leather, it will be expensive.",
      "The \u201cgimmick\u201d is at a \u201cvery early stage,\u201d said Tom Ellis,\u00a0professor of synthetic genome engineering at Imperial College London. \u201cI doubt that our knowledge of dinosaur evolution is good enough to be able to design a collagen gene specifically from T. rex.\u201d",
      "Producing real T. rex leather is \u201cvery far-fetched,\u201d added Ellis, who explained that the properties of any collagen that results from the project are likely to be similar to that of a cow or a chicken.",
      "That means any ensuing products will look and feel like any other alternative leather, Ellis said. \u201cIt gives them something that is at least unique and can justify a much\u00a0higher price,\u201d he said.",
      "Scientists can, in theory, get collagen gene sequences from any animal \u2014 it is the most abundant protein in mammals, for example, \u2014 and companies such as Geltor and Modern Meadow have made leather-like materials from genetically engineered collagen, launching small batches\u00a0of expensive products.",
      "If achieved, sustainably engineered animal leather may have environmental benefits. Right now, most leather is a byproduct of the cattle industry, which is partly responsible for deforestation in places such as the Amazon. Many synthetic and vegan leathers, meanwhile, are made of fossil fuel-derived plastics that don\u2019t biodegrade, according to World Wide Fund.",
      "In the meantime, while scientists are preoccupied with whether they can make dinosaur purses, fashionistas have time to stop and think about whether they should buy them."

      "A packed festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, to celebrate Filipino culture ended in tragedy Saturday night when a vehicle plowed into a crowd, killing 11 people and injuring dozens.",
      "A 30-year-old man was arrested and charged with several counts of murder in connection with the attack that officials do not believe was an act of terrorism.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know:",
      "The crash",
      "The attack happened at East 41st Avenue and Fraser Street at  8:14 p.m. local time, police said on X. People were at the Lapu Lapu Day block party in East Vancouver, an annual event that celebrates the Filipino culture.",
      "Yoseb Vardeh, who co-owns a food truck at the festival, told the Vancouver Sun that he heard an engine revving moments before a speeding vehicle drove down a pedestrian-only area. He said when he walked out of his food truck, he saw \"bodies everywhere.\"",
      "Clothing vendor Kris Pangilinan told The Associated Press that he heard what sounded \"like an F1 car about to start a race\" immediately followed by screams. He said he could hear the sound of bodies hitting the hood of the SUV as it sped through the street.",
      "\"All I can remember is seeing bodies flying up in the air higher than the food trucks themselves and landing on the ground and people yelling and screaming,\" he said.",
      "Adonis Quita, who was with his 9-year-old son, told the AP that the vehicle struck families waiting in line for food.",
      "\"He just pushed the gas all the way through the whole block ... crashing into everyone in his way,\" another witness said on NBC\u2019s \"TODAY\" show.",
      "\"Last night, as members of Vancouver\u2019s Filipino community gathered for a celebration of community and culture in East Vancouver, their collective safety and security were stolen when a man in a vehicle drove through a festival,\" the city\u2019s interim police chief, Steve Rai, said Sunday.",
      "Before the festival, police worked with the city to assess risks and found \"no known threats to the event or to the Filipino community,\" Rai explained. He said that, as a result, it was determined that police officers and heavy vehicle barricades were not necessary at the festival site.",
      "Officials said they do not believe the attack was an act of terrorism.",
      "The city said the Canadian flag will be flown at half-staff at all city buildings until further notice to honor the victims.",
      "The death toll",
      "Eleven people, aged 5 to 65, were killed and more than two dozen injured, police said, warning that the death toll could climb.",
      "Authorities have not publicly named the victims but have said they were taken to nine hospitals.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Toan Le said that three of his relatives were killed. He identified them as his brother, Richard Le, 47; his sister-in-law, Linh Hoang, 30; and his niece, Katie Le, 5.",
      "Toan Le said his brother died at the scene, while his sister-in-law and niece died at the hospital.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just one of the many, many families that have been affected by this tragedy, so even though we have lost three loved ones, we have closure, we can take next steps,\u201d he said. \u201cOther families are not as lucky and are just waiting to see if their loved one is going to make it.\u201d",
      "What is Lapu Lapu Day?",
      "In 2023, the province of British Columbia declared April 27 to be Lapu Lapu Day to celebrate the legacy of Datu Lapu-Lapu, a fearless Indigenous Visayan chieftain who was the first to rise against the tide of Spanish colonization, the festival\u2019s website states. He is often regarded as the country's first national hero.",
      "Last year was the inaugural block party.",
      "Headliners for the event were Filipino American artists Apl.de.Ap and J. Rey Soul from the group Black Eyed Peas.",
      "Apl.de.Ap said he and J. Rey Soul had just finished performing and left the stage minutes before the crash.",
      "\"It\u2019s hard to describe the shock and the heaviness we feel,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Please keep the victims, their families, and the organizers in your prayers. They need all the love and strength right now. The one thing I have noticed \u2014 from the audience to the messages sent around, is the sense of community that wraps its loving arms around us. We love you all.\"",
      "\"We came to Vancouver to celebrate and be with our community ... devastated beyond words to learn about the tragedy that unfolded,\" J. Rey Soul said. \"Still in shock. Thoughts and prayers to everyone and all the families affected. Sending love and prayers to all the Filipinos in BC.\"",
      "Filipino BC said in a statement on Instagram: \"We are still finding the words to express the deep heartbreak brought on by this senseless tragedy. We are devastated for the families and victims.\"",
      "The suspect",
      "Police identified the driver as 30-year-old Kai-Ji Adam Lo. He\u2019s been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, and police say further charges are anticipated.",
      "Festivalgoers subdued the man after the rampage until police arrived and took him into custody.",
      "Authorities said the suspect is a Vancouver resident who has a history of mental illness, and he is known to police.",
      "Mayor Sim said officials believe \"that mental health appears to be the underlying issue here.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) confirmed that Lo was under the care of a mental health team and was on extended leave under the Mental Health Act.",
      "When a person is on leave, they are monitored by a community mental health team that provides treatment and support as necessary, VCH said in a statement. If the person is not able to or refuses to follow their care plan, the mental health team can recall the person to the hospital.",
      "VCH said that an extended leave is intended to help people maintain their treatment plans while transitioning back into the community.",
      "\"In this situation, the care team followed established guidelines for a client on extended leave, and there was no indication this person was not following their treatment plan or presented a public safety risk,\" the statement read.",
      "At a news conference this week, police confirmed that Lo's brother, Alexander Lo, was murdered last year. CTV News reported that Lo set up a GoFundMe for funeral expenses and wrote that the death hit him with \"overwhelming force.\" The GoFundMe has been removed.",
      "A man was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in that case. CTV News, however, reported that the case is subject to a\u00a0publication ban, a court order that bars the media from sharing any information that could identify a victim, witness, or anyone else connected."
