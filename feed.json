      "Wayne Osmond, a singer, guitarist and founding member of the million-selling family act The Osmonds, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Wayne Osmond, a singer, guitarist and founding member of the million-selling family act The Osmonds, who were known for such 1970s teen hits as \u201cOne Bad Apple,\" \"Yo-Yo\" and \u201cDown By the Lazy River,\u201d has died. He was 73.",
      "Sibling Merrill Osmond posted on his Facebook page that Wayne died this week at a Salt Lake City hospital after suffering a \u201cmassive stroke.\u201d",
      "\u201cI've never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolutely no guile,\u201d Merrill wrote. \u201cAn individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.\u201d",
      "Wayne Osmond was the fourth oldest of nine children raised in a Mormon household in Ogden, Utah, and the second oldest among the musical performers. The siblings' career began in the 1950s when Wayne, Alan, Merrill and Jay sang as a barbershop quartet.",
      "Their popularity grew in the 1960s after being supported by singer Andy Williams, and they peaked as a quintet in the early 1970s, with younger brother Donny Osmond the breakout star. \u201cOne Bad Apple\u201d and other songs were often compared to the music of The Osmonds' contemporaries, the Jackson 5, and Donny was positioned as the white counterpart to the Jacksons' lead singer, Michael Jackson.",
      "The Osmonds' popularity faded by the mid-1970s, although Donny and Marie Osmond both enjoyed successful careers as solo performers and as a brother-sister duo.",
      "In the 1980s, Wayne Osmond regrouped with Alan, Merrill and Jay as a country act and had a handful of hits, including \u201cI Think About Your Lovin.'\u201d",
      "But in the mid-1990s he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and lost much of his hearing from the surgery and treatment. A stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful life. And you know, being able to hear is not all that it\u2019s cracked up to be, it really isn\u2019t,\u201d he told the Deseret News in 2018. \u201cMy favorite thing now is to take care of my yard. I turn my hearing aids off, deaf as a doorknob, tune everything out, it\u2019s really joyful.\u201d",
      "Wayne Osmond married Kathlyn White in 1974. They had five children.",

      "\u201cA positive identification of the remains cannot be made at this time pending autopsy results and further investigation,\u201d state police said on X.",
      "Investigators were sent Monday to a wooded area near Rothbury in Oceana County, site of the popular Electric Forest music festival. Forensic anthropologists from Western Michigan University also joined the effort.",

      "\u201cThey said they found his wallet, his phone, and he had a (festival) wristband on,\u201d Gary Graves said of police. \u201cThey just got to do an autopsy and dental records and everything and then they\u2019ll get back with us.\u201d",
      "Police in 2018 searched the area with dogs and dozens of volunteers, while divers checked area lakes. In 2023, a billboard with Graves' picture urged festival visitors to call police with any tips.",

    "story": [
      "Movie ticket sales are taking a bit of a hit in 2024",
      "Movie ticket sales took a bit of a hit in 2024. The annual domestic box office is expected to end up at around $8.75 billion, down more than 3% from 2023, according to estimates from Comscore.",
      "It\u2019s not as dire as it was in the pandemic years, but it\u2019s also not even close to the pre-pandemic norm when the annual box office regularly surpassed $11 billion.",
      "This is the year the business felt the effects of the Hollywood strikes of 2023, the labor standoff that delayed productions and releases and led to a depleted calendar for exhibitors and moviegoers. And yet it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been, or at least as bad as analysts projected at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThis has been a really incredible comeback story for the industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cJust a couple of months ago it was a question of whether we would even hit $8 billion for the year.\u201d",
      "Hollywood continues to learn lessons about what moviegoers really want, what works and what doesn\u2019t. Here are the biggest takeaways from 2024.",
      "The Hollywood strikes might have ended in 2023, putting productions back into full swing and sending stars out on the promotional circuit again \u2014 but the ripple effect of the work stoppages and contract standoffs showed their real effects on the 2024 release calendar.",
      "The first two quarters were hit hardest, with tentpoles pushed later in the year (\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d for one) or even into 2025 (like \u201cMission: Impossible 8\u201d). With no Marvel movie kicking off the summer moviegoing season, the box office was down a devastating 27.5% from 2023 right before \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened in June.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unpredictable business but it thrives on stability,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhen the release calendar is thrown off, the momentum stops.\u201d",
      "Sequels and franchises dominated the top 10 movies of the year, as has often been the case in the past 15 years. But this year, films carrying a PG rating did especially well, starting with the biggest movie of 2024: \u201cInside Out 2,\" which also became the biggest animated movie of all time, not accounting for inflation.",
      "Family films with a PG rating \u2014 including \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d\u201cMoana 2,\u201d\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d \u201cMufasa\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d \u2014 grossed over $2.9 billion this year, accounting for around 33% of the annual box office, according to Comscore. Movies rated PG-13, by contrast, made up about 30% of ticket sales.",
      "After a quieter 2023 and several years without a film at the very top of the charts, the Walt Disney Co. came back roaring in 2024 with three of the top five movies of the year: \"Inside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d In mid-December, it crossed the $2 billion domestic mark, the second time any studio has done so since 2019 (that was also Disney, in 2022). Its 20th Century division also played an important part with \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different industry when Disney commits to theatrical releases,\u201d said Daniel Loria, an executive at the movie data and analytics trade The Boxoffice Company.",
      "Every year has high-profile flops and disappointments, and this was no exception. Sony had a rough go with its \u201cSpider-Man\u201d adjacent titles like \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d (but this also seems to be the fate lately for anyone not named \u201cDeadpool\u201d). Universal had higher hopes for \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d as did Warner Bros. for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d",
      "Then there were the filmmaker-driven (and financed) passion projects that failed to take off like Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201cHorizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reductive way of thinking about those passion projects,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThose movies didn\u2019t come out with huge expectations, meaning theaters didn\u2019t clear out the house and give them three auditoriums per site in hopes for money to come in.\u201d",
      "This was, however, part of the problem with \u201cJoker 2,\u201d which was expected to be more in line with the first which made over $1 billion. But even that has a caveat, Loria thinks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that \u2018Joker\u2019 didn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s that there was nothing coming in behind it to make up that momentum,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThat\u2019s more the fault of a release schedule where one movie is supposed to carry a month. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d",
      "What does work, Loria said, is a diverse lineup, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas successes being the perfect example. At Thanksgiving, there was \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d Christmas had \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cSonic 3,\u201d and a lot of adult offerings too, including \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "Horror is often the safest bet for theatrical, but this year had even veterans pleasantly surprised by just how enthusiastic that audience can be, with hits like \u201cLonglegs,\u201d \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d and \u201cSmile 2\u201d getting people out of the house.",
      "The Blake Lively drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\" which had its share of ongoing off-screen drama as well, also became an event. Audiences turned out for smart thrillers, like \u201cConclave\u201d as well as unexpected originals including \u201cAnora,\" \u201cThe Substance\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Re-releases of movies in theaters that are also widely available in the home thrived this year. Some of the biggest successes included Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar,\"\u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said in December. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it.\"",
      "As silly as it sounds, this is the year the novelty popcorn bucket became a star. It started with the accidentally suggestive \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d creation, which \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d latched onto in a less accidental way. More recently, the \u201cNosferatu\u201d coffin buckets have been fetching high resale prices.",
      "For Loria, it\u2019s all part of a trend that theaters have been noticing since reopening during the pandemic: Moviegoers aren\u2019t back in pre-pandemic numbers, but those who did come back were spending more on concessions and premium tickets (like IMAX and other large format screens) than ever before.",
      "Everyone is optimistic for the film business in 2025, and the offerings for moviegoers \u2014 which include at least 110 films projected to open on over 2,000 screens \u2014 according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. And the momentum is there.",
      "\u201cThere's been a huge amount of box office generated in the last six weeks of the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is the best opening act 2025 could have.\u201d"

      "Actor Blake Lively has sued the director of the film \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d alleging harassment on the set and a coordinated campaign to smear her reputation",
      "Actor Blake Lively sued \"It Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Lively's suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign.",
      "The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "Lively's suit said that Baldoni, the film's production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\u201d by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits.",
      "The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively.",
      "The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath \u201cdiscussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lively's lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively's lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least $250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit.",
      "Others who are defendants in Lively's suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit.",
      "The libel lawsuit says the newspaper \u201crelied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that \u201cour story was meticulously and responsibly reported.\"",
      "\u201cIt was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the statement said.",
      "But Baldoni's lawsuit says that \u201cIf the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that \u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today.\"",
      "The romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were \u201cabsolutely entitled to that opinion.\u201d",
      "He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Freedman, said in a statement on the libel suit that \u201cthe New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful \u2018untouchable\u2019 Hollywood elites.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public,\" he added. \"The irony is rich.\u201d",

      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are coming back to the small screen",
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit have been stars since the beginning.",
      "In the 35 years since Nick Park introduced the world to his stop-motion creations and their eccentric, unapologetically British existence, they\u2019ve won Oscars, appeared in commercials, video games, animated series and even the occasional bit of (unofficial) protest art. Feature films, however, have been few and far between. Part of the reason is the difficulty: Even a 30-minute short can take upward of two years. Besides, why mess with a formula that\u2019s produced only classics?",
      "After working on the pair\u2019s first feature, \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d which was released in 2005 and won an Oscar, and \u201cEarly Man,\u201d Park even doubted that he\u2019d dabble in the form again. But sometimes inspiration requires a little more breathing room: That's how the second \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d feature film, \u201cVengeance Most Fowl,\u201d came to be. It debuts on Netflix worldwide, except in the U.K., on Friday.",
      "Gnomes have always been part of Wallace and Gromit\u2019s world. After \u201cThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d Park started kicking around an idea about a smart gnome, Norbot, built to help Gromit in the garden.",
      "\u201cThere was something a bit missing,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe tinkered around with the story on and off for years and it seemed to be lacking the more sinister element that\u2019s often in \u2018Wallace & Gromit.\u2019 Why do the gnomes go wrong? Who was the motivated villain?\u201d",
      "Five years ago, the solution came to them: Feathers McGraw, the conniving penguin with a penchant for heists and simple disguises, who turned their lives to chaos in \u201cThe Wrong Trousers.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was the answer to everything,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe story got bigger and more exciting. Suddenly it became a feature-length film.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Park and his co-director Merlin Crossingham often heard fan requests to bring Feathers back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d been very noncommittal about it because characters haven\u2019t in the past come back,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cBut when we did drop a little teaser trailer, we were completely bowled over by the response. At that point, we were still making the film and it kind of gave us a boost and that confidence that it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "They needed it too since Feathers McGraw, like a true diva, was by far the most difficult puppet to animate, direct and light \u2014 this in a movie that has chase sequences, special effects and an army of evil gnomes. The simplicity of his design, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak, gave them no room to hide. In fact, in their world-class group of animators at Aardman, Park said only five volunteered to work on Feathers.",
      "\u201cAll the filmmaking tricks have to come together very well to make Feathers have that screen presence that we needed from him,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "Part of the charm of the \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d films is their unabashed Britishness, which the filmmakers have had to fight (politely) to preserve as their audience has become more and more global. While Netflix was largely supportive, they did have a bit of a back and forth over the turn of phrase \u201cFlippin\u2019 Nora!\u201d (They ultimately kept it.)",
      "\u201cA lot of the stuff in the films is inspired by stuff we grew up with, the design of things, little products,\u201d Park said.",
      "He was particularly happy to include a \u201chigh-speed\u201d barge chase on the canals and a joke about police at the Yorkshire border \u2014 melding uniquely British references with big Hollywood movie tropes.",
      "\u201cI think all of it is a sort of a lovely homage to Britishness and not in a patriotic way, just kind of laughing at ourselves culturally,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "The starting point for all scenes was always the traditional: In camera, stop-motion animation like they\u2019ve been using since 1989. It is, Crossingham said, fundamentally vital to the films to see the thumbprints on the characters and know that they're handmade.",
      "There have always been limitations, and the option to use more digital assistance, but it\u2019s only been in recent years that computer graphics have caught up enough to blend in. Effects like fog and steam are possible in stop-motion, but, they explained, they never look quite right.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we required was that if we were going to use a digital technique, could we force it to look right for our film rather than it just being bolted on and feeling like an accessory that was a bit of an unwelcome guest,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cThe visual effects department at Aardman worked very hard to get that stylizing so that it felt right in \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 in which and the sets and the props are characters in themselves.\u201d",
      "The tension between embracing technological innovation like artificial intelligence and preserving the old ways that still work was not just something they were thinking about off-camera. It\u2019s at the heart of the film too, as Wallace\u2019s well-intentioned invention turns against him (and wreaks havoc on the town).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit meta,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that resonates with audiences with stop-motion that they can tell it\u2019s handcrafted, they can tell that\u2019s the human touch.\u201d",
      "Park said he used to worry about the future of stop-motion, wondering how much time they had left. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen a resurgence.",
      "\u201cAs long as we\u2019re telling good stories, entertaining and compelling stories with compelling characters, we\u2019ll keep going,\u201d he said.",

      "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas. But, nearly two months after its release, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, has drawn millions of moviegoers across the South American country.",
      "The film's domestic box office success \u2014 with nearly 3 million tickets sold, it secured the fifth spot at the 2024 box office by mid December \u2014 is rooted in its exploration of a long-neglected national trauma, but it is particularly timely, especially as Brazil confronts a recent near-miss with democratic rupture.",
      "Set in the 1970s and based on true events, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d tells the story of the Paivas, an upper-class family in Rio de Janeiro shattered by the dictatorship. Rubens Paiva, a former leftist congressman, was taken into custody by the military in 1971 and was never seen again. The narrative centers on his wife, Eunice Paiva, and her lifelong pursuit of justice.",
      "The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film and shortlisted for the Oscars in the same category.",
      "\u201cComedies and other topics are more likely to become mega-successes, but this (the dictatorship) is a very taboo subject for us,\u201d said Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer Vera Iaconelli, adding that she felt a \u201csense of urgency\u201d after watching the movie last month, even though the dictatorship ended almost four decades ago.",
      "As the movie was being shown across Brazil, the Federal Police unsealed a report detailing a 2022 plot by military officers to stage a coup to prevent President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, and to keep far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro in power. Bolsonaro and his allies have denied any involvement in participating or inciting a coup.",
      "\u201cEven if (director) Walter Salles wanted to plan the timing of the release this precisely, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it so right,\u201d said Lucas Pedretti, a historian and sociologist whose works address memory and reparations after the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cThe film plays a very important role in telling us: \u2018Look, this is what would happen if the coup that was planned by Bolsonaro and his military officers had succeeded.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike countries like Argentina and Chile, which established truth commissions and prosecuted former dictators and their henchmen, Brazil's transition back to democracy was marked by a sweeping amnesty to military officials.",
      "For years, said Pedretti, Brazil\u2019s military promoted the notion that government silence was the best way to bury the past.",
      "It was not until 2011 that Brazil\u2019s then- President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses.",
      "The commission's 2014 report detailed harrowing accounts of torture and named perpetrators of human rights violations \u2014 none were ever imprisoned. But just as a reckoning of the dictatorship began, calls for a return to military rule emerged in street protests against corruption revelations.",
      "It was then that Marcelo Rubens Paiva, one of Rubens' sons, decided to share his family's story in his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here.\" The book introduced Eunice Paiva to a larger audience, chronicling her journey from a housewife to a relentless advocate for her disappeared husband, and how she raised five children by herself, while also pursuing a law degree.",
      "In the years that followed, far-right, anti-establishment forces increasingly gained traction. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has long celebrated the coup and praised dictatorship-era torturers \u2014 would go on to ride that wave to a presidential victory in 2018.",
      "Observing the surge of the far-right in Brazil, filmmaker Salles realized the country's memory of its dictatorship was very fragile. He said he saw a need for his country to confront its trauma in order to prevent history from repeating itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d isn\u2019t the first Brazilian movie to explore the memory of the dictatorship, but it is the most popular. Unlike other films on the subject that tend to focus on dissidents and armed resistance, Salles chose to frame his as a family drama and how the disappearance of the family patriarch upended their day-to-day lives.",
      "Its climax \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 arrives 25 years after Rubens\u2019 disappearance, when Eunice finally receives his death certificate.",
      "In December, a month after the film\u2019s premiere, the Brazilian government allowed families of dictatorship-era victims to obtain reissued death certificates acknowledging state-sponsored killings.",
      "\"It is very symbolic that this is happening amid the international repercussion of \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 ... so younger people can understand a bit of what that period was like,\u201d Brazil's Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo said during the announcement, calling it an important step in the \u201chealing process for Brazilian society.\u201d",
      "The healing process remains incomplete, as some forces \u2014 once again \u2014 seek to prevent those who allegedly sought to sabotage democracy from being held to account.",
      "On Nov. 29, Bolsonaro urged Lula and the Supreme Court to grant amnesty for those involved in the 2022 alleged coup plot and, alongside his allies, pushed for legislation to pardon participants in the 2023 anti-democratic riot that aimed to oust Lula and marked an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe coup is still here. It\u2019s still in people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s still in the minds of the military,\u201d said Paulo Sergio Almeida, a filmmaker and founder of Filme B, a company that tracks Brazil's national cinema. \u201cWe thought this was a thing of the past, but it\u2019s not. The past is still present in Brazil.\u201d",
      "This time around, many Brazilians are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the attempted coup, believing that justice is essential for national reconciliation and future progress.",
      "On Dec. 14, police arrested Bolsonaro's 2022 running mate and former defense minister in connection with investigations into the alleged coup plot, becoming the first four-star general arrested by civilians since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.",
      "\u201cIt's a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy,\u201d leftist Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues wrote on X that day. \u201cBrazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a HISTORIC day on this journey.\u201d",
      "Brazilians have also embraced the \u201cNo amnesty!\" rallying cry, which originated at street protests in the aftermath of the capital's 2023 riot and can still be heard.",
      "Earlier this month, a Supreme Court justice cited \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d while arguing that the 1979 amnesty law shouldn\u2019t apply to the crime of concealing bodies.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of Rubens Paiva, whose body was never found or buried, highlights the enduring pain of thousands of families,\u201d Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino said.",
      "Striking a chord in Brazil was precisely Marcelo Rubens Paiva's intent when adapting his book into a film.",
      "\u201cThe movie is sparking this debate, and it arrived at the right moment for people to recognize that living under a dictatorship is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent evening in Sao Paulo, 46-year-old Juliana Patr\u00edcia and her 16-year-old daughter, Ana J\u00falia, left a movie theater in tears, touched by \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw all the suffering that Eunice endured, with Rubens being killed and taken from his family in such a brutal way,\u201d Patr\u00edcia said. \u201cIt made us even more certain that democracy needs to be respected and that, as Brazilians, we must fight harder to ensure that this never happens in our country again.\u201d",

      "Shyer died in Los Angeles on Friday, his daughter, filmmaker Hallie Meyers-Shyer told The Associated Press on Sunday. No cause was disclosed.",
      "A son of Hollywood, whose father Melville Shyer was one of the founding members of the Directors Guild of America, Shyer made an indelible mark on comedies, mostly of the romantic persuasion, in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Born in Los Angeles in 1941, Shyer cut his teeth writing for television, assisting Garry Marshall and working on shows like \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d before transitioning to films. He had writing credits on \u201cSmokey and the Bandit,\u201d Jack Nicholson\u2019s \u201cGoin\u2019 South\u201d and the Walter Matthau drama \u201cHouse Calls.\u201d A big breakthrough came with \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d the Goldie Hawn comedy about a wealthy woman who inadvertently signs up for basic training, which he co-wrote with Meyers and Harvey Miller.",
      "It was a script that was initially turned down by every studio in Hollywood, even with Hawn attached to star and produce.",
      "\u201cWe went to a meeting at Paramount after they read the script, and Mike Eisner was the president of the studio, and we sat in his office with Mike and (producer) Don Simpson. And Mike said to Goldie, \u2018This is a mistake for you to make this movie,\u2019\u201d Shyer told Indiewire in 2022. \u201cGod bless Don Simpson who spoke up and said, \u2018Mike, you\u2019re 100% wrong on this one.\u2019\u201d",
      "The movie became one of the biggest hits of 1980. It got them an Oscar nomination and a win from the Writers Guild and also paved the way for his directorial debut \u201cIrreconcilable Differences.\u201d",
      "That film, which he also wrote with Meyers (they married in 1980), starred Shelley Long and Ryan O\u2019Neal as a writing-directing duo whose relationship crumbles after success and an infatuation with a young actor played by Sharon Stone. It was partially inspired by the tabloid affairs of Peter Bogdanovich, who left his wife and producer Polly Platt for Cybill Shepherd.",
      "\u201cNancy and I just laughed at the same things. We love the same movies, we kind of educate each other on the movies that each of us loved,\u201d Shyer told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd Nancy really made me laugh. I think she wrote the best one-liners of anybody I know, except Neil Simon. And, and we were just always in sync \u2014 as filmmakers, we had this thing.\u201d",
      "They followed with \u201cBaby Boom,\u201d in which Diane Keaton plays a working woman who suddenly has to care for a baby, and \u201cFather of the Bride,\u201d which reimagined Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1950 film for the 1990s with Keaton, Steve Martin and Martin Short leading the comedic ensemble. It was successful enough to spawn a sequel.",
      "Shyer and Meyers' last collaboration as a married couple before divorcing in 1999 was the remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d with Lindsay Lohan, which Meyers directed and Shyer co-wrote and produced. Their daughters Annie and Hallie, whose names were used for Lohan\u2019s twin characters, both appeared in the film. Shyer is also survived by two children, Jacob and Sophia, from a subsequent marriage that ended in divorce.",
      "While Shyer often found himself doing remakes, he and Meyers never wanted to do \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of the originals and always endeavored to put their own stamp on their films. But even he was surprised by the longevity of some of them, remembering an old Billy Wilder quote that \u201ccomedy is not like fine wine, it does not age well.\u201d But, he said, they tried to avoid the temptation to include too many timely references.",
      "\u201cYou try to write things that are not basically of the moment, especially in comedy,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cTry to write stories about human beings that will reflect on today and tomorrow and yesterday.\u201d",
      "Shyer went on to remake \u201cAlfie,\u201d with Jude Law, and the Hilary Swank period drama \u201cThe Affair of the Necklace,\u201d neither of which did well at the box office. He also directed the Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte movie \u201cI Love Trouble,\u201d the only film of his that he admitted he didn't like.",
      "Other films never saw the light of day: He spent a year and a half prepping \u201cEloise in Paris\u201d but it was canceled when the production company suddenly went out of business.",
      "He stepped away from directing for many years but returned in recent years with two Netflix Christmas romantic comedies: \u201cThe Noel Diary\u201d and \u201cBest. Christmas. Ever!\u201d",
      "\u201cI just gravitated towards stuff I like,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a James Bond movie. I\u2019ve never seen one. I never liked science-fiction movies. \u2026 I like movies about people, and I want them to have substance.\u201d",
      "Shyer had told Indiewire that he was working on a script he'd been thinking about for decades, since he was hospitalized briefly at 17. He described the movie as a cross between \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d and \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d And retirement, he said at the time, was not in the cards.",
      "\u201cWhat am I going to do? Garden?\u201d he said. \u201cI just have a lot of energy. I want to keep going. I actually love the process and I love the camaraderie. I love what I do. If I drop dead, maybe it will be holding a camera.\u201d"

      "Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while \u201cMufasa\u201d brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s \u201cMufasa\u201d had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.",
      "It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.",
      "The vampire horror \u201cNosferatu\u201d also debuted fairly triumphantly. Robert Eggers\u2019 modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; the erotic drama \u201cBabygirl\u201d with Nicole Kidman; and \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d about boxer Claressa Shields.",
      "\u201cNosferatu\u201d landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting \u201cThe Faculty's\u201d $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters.",
      "The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.",
      "\u201cBabygirl,\u201d an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend showings where it played in 2006 theaters.",
      "Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to \u201cWicked,\u201d which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It\u2019s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.",

      "Snoop Dogg also has been involved in football for years; as a youth coach, guest analyst, with his own Snoop League for inner city youth in Southern California.

      "Snoop Dogg caught a few passes from Miami\u2019s equipment manager during warmups and stopped by a tailgate outside for a few sips of gin & juice. He generated a huge roar walking out of the tunnel for the coin toss, decked out in a green-and-gold Arizona Bowl sweatsuit, sunglasses, gray Snoop Dogg sneakers, a black Gin & Juice hat and, of course, a bit of bling draped around his neck.",
      "Snoop Dogg shook hands with captains from both sides, flipped the coin \u2014 with a little flair - and posed for a photo with two of the officials before jogging to Colorado State\u2019s sideline, where he donned a headset to do a little play calling.",
      "Between quarters, Snoop Dogg tried to fire the T-shirt cannon \u2014 the shirts only flew a few feet so he waved it off \u2014 and stopped by to bop his head to a circle of Native American performers before heading up to the booth to join the TV broadcast.",

      "NEW HOPE, Pa. -- Dayle Haddon, an actor, activist and trailblazing former \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d model who pushed back against age discrimination by reentering the industry as a widow, has died in a Pennsylvania home from what authorities believe was carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Authorities in Bucks County found Haddon, 76, dead in a second-floor bedroom Friday morning after emergency dispatchers were notified about a person unconscious at the Solebury Township home. A 76-year-old man police later identified as Walter J. Blucas of Erie was hospitalized in critical condition.",

      "As a model, Haddon appeared on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle and Esquire in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1973 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. She also appeared in about two dozen films from the 1970s to 1990s, according to IMDb.com, including 1994\u2019s \u201cBullets Over Broadway,\u201d starring John Cusack.",
      "Haddon left modeling after giving birth to her daughter, Ryan, in the mid-1970s, but then had to reenter the workforce after her husband's 1991 death. This time she found the modeling industry far less friendly: \u201cThey said to me, \u2018At 38, you\u2019re not viable,\u2019\u201d Haddon told The New York Times in 2003.",
      "Working a menial job at an advertising agency, Haddon began reaching out to cosmetic companies, telling them there was a growing market to sell beauty products to aging baby boomers. She eventually landed a contract with Clairol, followed by Est\u00e9e Lauder and then L\u2019Oreal, for which she promoted the company's anti-aging products for more than a decade. She also hosted beauty segments for CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Early Show.\u201d",
      "\"I kept modeling, but in a different way,\" she told The Times, \u201cI became a spokesperson for my age.\u201d",

      "Haddon was born in Toronto and began modeling as a teenager to pay for ballet classes \u2014 she began her career with the Canadian ballet company Les Grands Ballet Canadiens, according to her website.",
      "Haddon's daughter, Ryan, said in a social media post that her mother was \u201ceveryone\u2019s greatest champion. An inspiration to many.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.",
      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "Exhibition curator Nontobeko Ntombela also has included pieces that document the struggles of Nelson Mandela, who was released after almost three decades in prison and became South Africa's first Black president when the country transitioned from white minority rule to democracy in 1994.",
      "These include a letter Mahlangu wrote to Mandela thanking him for the sacrifices he made for the country.",
      "She is respected for persevering with art at a time when Black artists, especially women, were hardly acknowledged.",
      "\u201cMahlangu dared to travel an uncharted path during a time when Black women artists were systemically overlooked. I hope when people see just how much she has done, they will realize the magnitude of what she has offered to the arts,\u201d Ntombela said.",

      "Longtime CBS sportscaster Greg Gumbel has died from cancer",
      "Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from his family released by the network on Friday. He was 78.",
      "\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\u201d wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement.",
      "In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues.",
      "Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties.",
      "In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship.",
      "David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness.",
      "\u201cA tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" Berson said.",
      "Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998.",
      "Sean McManus said of all the moves he made in his nearly 27 1/2 years leading CBS Sports, one of his proudest was bringing Gumbel back.",
      "\u201cNot only did he elevate our NFL and NCAA coverage to a new level, but his kindness, generosity, sense of humor and unselfishness were second to none. When he was around, he made everyone from the researchers to the technicians to the executives feel like he was their best friend,\u201d said McManus, who retired as CBS Sports chairman in April. \u201cHis love for his family was always the foundation of his life. There will never be another Greg Gumbel, and our industry and this world is a sadder place without him.\u201d",
      "Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the world figure skating championships and the following year hosted NBC\u2019s daytime coverage of the Atlanta Summer Olympics.",
      "But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 NFL studio show, \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05.",
      "Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,\" he said.",
      "Gumbel also called NFL games as the network\u2019s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.",
      "\u201cLike all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\u201d Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \u201cWhat a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\u201d",
      "Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003.",
      "Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn\u2019t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \u201cBy my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\u201d",
      "Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network.",
      "James Brown, who currently hosts \u201cThe NFL Today,\" described Gumbel on Friday as \u201cMr. Versatility and also very telegenic.\u201d",

      "Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting.",
      "Outside of his broadcast career, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital for 16 years.",

      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
    "story": [
      "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As Colorado becomes the second state to legalize psychedelic therapy this week, a clash is playing out in Colorado Springs, where conservative leaders are restricting the treatment over objections from some of the city's 90,000 veterans, who've become flagbearers for psychedelic therapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Colorado residents voted to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the chemical compound found in psychedelic mushrooms, in a 2022 ballot measure, launching two years of rulemaking before it could be used to treat conditions such as depression and PTSD.",
      "This week, companies and people will be able to apply for licenses to administer the mind-altering drug, though treatment will likely not be available for some months as applications are processed.",
      "Colorado joined Oregon in legalizing psilocybin therapy, though the drug remains illegal in most other states and federally. Over the last year, a growing number of Oregon cities have voted to ban psilocybin. While Colorado metros cannot ban the treatment under state law, several conservative cities have worked to preemptively restrict what are known as \u201chealing centers.\u201d",
      "At a City Council meeting in Colorado Springs this month, members were set to vote on extending the state prohibition on healing centers from 1,000 feet (305 meters) to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from certain locations, such as schools. From the lectern, veterans implored them not to.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to support veterans, and it\u2019s a really easy one to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to,\u201d said Lane Belone, a special forces veteran who said he's benefited from his own psychedelic experiences. Belone argued that the restrictions effectively limit the number of centers and would mean longer waiting lists for the treatment.",
      "Veterans have pulled in some conservative support for psychedelic therapy \u2014 managing to set it apart from other politically charged drug policies such as legalizing marijuana.",
      "That distinction was made clear by Councilmember David Leinweber, who said at the council meeting both that marijuana is \u201cliterally killing our kids\u201d and that he supported greater access to psilocybin therapy.",
      "Psilocybin is far more restricted in Colorado than marijuana, which the state legalized in 2014. Psilocybin is decriminalized but there won\u2019t be recreational dispensaries for the substance, which will be largely confined to licensed businesses and therapy sessions with licensed facilitators.",
      "Patients will have to go through a risk assessment, preliminary meetings, then follow-up sessions and remain with a facilitator while under the drug's influence. The psilocybin will also be tested, and the companies that grow them regulated by a state agency.",
      "Still, allowing broader access to the treatment hasn't been easy for most of the city councilmembers, including three who are veterans. Colorado Springs is home to two Air Force bases and the U.S. Air Force Academy, and local leaders frequently tout it as an ideal community for retired service members.",
      "\u201cI will never sit up here and criticize a veteran for wanting to find a medical treatment to fix or to help with the issues that they carry,\u201d said Council President Randy Helms, a veteran himself.",
      "Still, he continued, \u201cDo I think that it\u2019s helpful to not just veterans but to individuals? Probably so. Do I think it still needs to be tested under strict requirements? Yes.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Springs City Council passed the proposed restrictions.",
      "While research has shown promise for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA, also known as molly, in helping people with conditions such as alcoholism, depression and PTSD, the scientific field remains in its relatively early stages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the potential value, but I\u2019m very concerned that we\u2019ve gotten too far ahead of our skis,\u201d said Jeffrey Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who's been involved in studies of psychedelic drugs' therapeutic efficacy.",
      "The risks, said Lieberman, include customers being misled and paying out of pocket for expensive treatments. He also said there are cases where the drugs can exacerbate some extreme mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.",
      "In Oregon, where the treatments started in June 2023, costs can reach $2,000 for one session. Of the over 16,000 doses administered in the state, staff have only called 911 or taken a patient to the hospital five times.",
      "Other Colorado Springs city councilmembers raised concerns that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved psilocybin to treat mental health conditions and, in August, rejected the psychedelic MDMA to treat PTSD. A number of clinical trials are still underway for both drugs.",
      "Some researchers, advocacy groups and veterans worry that waiting on slow-moving bureaucracy \u2014 namely the FDA \u2014 carries its own risks as people continue to struggle with mental illnesses. Advocates argue that psychedelic therapy offers an option to those for whom talk therapy alone and antidepressants have not helped.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis that we are in, and this is a tool that we can add to our toolbox,\u201d said Taylor West, executive director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, which advocates for psychedelic therapy.",
      "Belone said he's carried his military experience long after leaving the special forces. It started when he first heard artillery sirens wailing in a U.S. base in Iraq, his breath catching with fear for a few thudding moments.",
      "That fear kept him on edge when he returned stateside and found himself always keeping his back to the wall, looking for exits to the room he was in, never quite able to give himself fully to the music at a concert.",
      "A psychedelic experience with psilocybin, said Belone, helped him connect the fear that attached to him in the war zone to the ceaseless anxiety at home. It didn\u2019t solve everything overnight, he said, but it allowed him to better identify when that humming fear was getting in the way of a joyful life.",

      "A new year brings new goals",
      "New York -- A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don\u2019t tend to uphold their New Year\u2019s resolutions much past the first month.",
      "In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It\u2019s called the \u2019Winter Arc.\u2019",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.",
      "For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.",
      "It\u2019s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it\u2019s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.",
      "Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed \u201cCEO of Glowup Series,\u201d posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to \u201cwalking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI found it very transformative both mentally and physically,\u201d Galebe says. \u201cThe consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.\u201d",
      "Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it\u2019s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.",
      "\u201cIf you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,\" Rothstein says, \u201cyou will have an easier time adhering to the program.\u201d",
      "He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. \u201cRecognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.\u201d",
      "Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness \u201ccozy and convenient\u201d in the cold winter months.",
      "\u201cIf the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.\u201d",
      "To recap:",
      "\u2014Set realistic, attainable goals.",
      "\u2014Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.",
      "\u2014Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.",
      "\u2014Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.",
      "Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide \u201cpositive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.\u201d",
      "When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. \u201cPutting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It\u2019s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.\u201d",
      "Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily true.",
      "\u201cIf the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,\u201d Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way."

      "",
      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.",
      "",
      "\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.",
      "A norovirus infection is characterized by sudden vomiting and diarrhea. Outbreaks are often seen on cruise ships, in congregate living situations like nursing homes and jails, as well as schools and places where people are close together.",
      "Here are a few things to know about the virus.",
      "Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, responsible for 58% of such infections acquired in the country each year, according to the CDC.",
      "Norovirus infections are caused by a group of viruses that spread easily, with as few as 10 viral particles having the ability to make someone sick, health experts say.",
      "There are about 2,500 norovirus outbreaks reported annually in the United States. The outbreaks can occur throughout the year but are most common from November to April.",
      "Along with with vomiting and diarrhea, common symptoms include nausea, stomach pain, body ache, headache and fever.",
      "Most norovirus outbreaks occur when people who are already infected spread the virus to others by direct means, such as through sharing food or eating utensils. Outbreaks can also be spread through food, water or contaminated surfaces .",
      "Illness caused by norovirus typically starts suddenly, with symptoms developing 12 to 48 hours following exposure to the virus. Most people get better within one to three days and recover fully.",
      "But with 19 to 21 million illnesses each year in the United States, norovirus nevertheless causes on average 900 deaths and 109,000 hospitalizations annually, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. It also leads to 465,000 emergency department visits, mostly involving young children.",
      "People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.",
      "There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea and alcohol.",
      "Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing. Dehydrated children may be unusually sleepy or fussy and cry with few or no tears.",
      "Rigorous and frequent handwashing is the best defense against norovirus during the peak winter season, scrubbing the hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds before meals.",
      "Scrubbing surfaces with household disinfectants can also help."

      "Even with abortion bans in place in most Republican-controlled states, the number of people obtaining them has grown slightly",
      "Abortion has become slightly more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet.",
      "It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans.",
      "The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "Here's a look at data on where things stand:",
      "Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the U.S.",
      "But one thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained.",
      "There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.",
      "\u201cAbortion bans don\u2019t actually prevent abortions from happening,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "But, she said, they do change care.",
      "For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions \u2014 and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.",
      "For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills.",
      "As the bans swept in, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation.",
      "They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it\u2019s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.",
      "But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions was via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access.",
      "This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances,\u201d and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.",
      "Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.",
      "But a network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortion in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans.",
      "Abortion funds, which benefitted from \u201crage giving\u201d in 2022, have helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give.",
      "Since the downfall of Roe, the actions of lawmakers and courts have kept shifting where abortion is legal and under what conditions.",
      "Here's where it stands now:",
      "Florida, the nation\u2019s second most-populous state, began enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy on May 1.",
      "That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortion to an exporter of people looking for them.",
      "There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer.",
      "While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.",
      "The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.",
      "But some states where abortion remains legal until viability \u2013 generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there\u2019s no fixed time for it \u2013 have seen clinics open and expand.",
      "Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.",
      "There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.",
      "But Myers says some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So they\u2019re now in the count of clinics \u2013 even though they might provide few of them.",
      "How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration says hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration\u2019s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.",
      "More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms and were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.",
      "Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.",
      "\u201cIt is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,\u201d Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.",
      "Since Roe was overturned, there have been 18 reproductive rights-related statewide ballot questions.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on 14 of them and lost on four.",
      "In the 2024 election, they amended the constitutions in five states to add the right to abortion. Such measures failed in three states: In Florida, where it required 60% support; in Nebraska, which had competing abortion ballot measures; and in South Dakota, where most national abortion rights groups did support the measure.",
      "AP VoteCast data found that more than three-fifths of voters in 2024 supported abortion being legal in all or most cases \u2013 a slight uptick from 2020. The support came even as voters supported Republicans to control the White House and both houses of Congress.",

      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",

      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "Many clinicians interviewed said that just as cancer treatment often requires a combination of surgery and drugs, combination therapy will be the treatment plan for many patients with obesity. They may take the medications to lower weight to better prepare them for surgery, or after surgery after they reach a plateau.",
      "",
      "A possible offsetting factor is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposal last month that it would pay for the new weight loss drugs in 2026, if the new administration approves.",

      "Making Adjustments",

      "Nationally, he expects many bariatric surgeons will adjust as well, diversifying their surgical repertoire. \"Surgeons who are only doing bariatric surgery need to reconfigure,\" he said. \"Current bariatric fellowship graduates may find it difficult to obtain a pure bariatric practice and may need to alternate with acute care surgery.\"",
      "",
      "For many bariatric surgeons, the prospect of taking on general surgery  --  where often it's one-and-done  --  goes against the reason they chose weight-loss surgery as a specialty. They wanted longer-term relationships with their patients.",
      "",
      "\"We operate on the patients and ideally follow them for as long as they're willing to come back, to make sure they're maintaining weight loss and healthy habits and help them along the way,\" Husain said. \"The theme in our world is that obesity is a chronic disease.\"",

      "The Payers Aren't Helping",
      "",
      "Benjamin Clapp, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus in El Paso, Texas, chairs the ASMBS task force that tracks bariatric surgical volume every year.",
      "",
      "He said neither the official totals for 2023 nor estimates for 2024 are collected yet. However, data from centers accredited by the American College of Surgeons, which perform about 80% to 83% of all bariatric surgeries in this country, show that volumes were down by 5.5%, or more than 12,000 weight-reduction surgeries, in 2023.",
      "",
      "But 2024 is expected to be \"much, much worse because of the overwhelming impact that the GLP-1 drugs have had, which really took off this year,\" Clapp said.",
      "",
      "This year in El Paso he expects to perform 120 bariatric surgeries, compared with 180 in 2023. \"These are massive decreases in volume, at least for me,\" he said. \"I went from seeing 15 to 20 new bariatric patients weekly to one to three.\"",
      "",
      "The Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery at Columbia University said earlier this year that it expected a 10% to 20% decline in 2024 from 2023.",
      "",
      "That drop in bariatric demand is one of two big reasons why Clapp has made a career decision to leave the solo practice he has built up for the last 18 years.",
      "",
      "Sometime next year, he plans to either take an academic job and devote more time to studying how brain receptors function in rats with obesity, or become an employed hospital surgeon. On staff, he would do any variety of procedures and probably far fewer bariatric procedures on which he has built his practice.",
      "",
      "The other reason is declining reimbursement. Clapp said Medicare rates for common bariatric surgery CPT codes have dropped since 2019, despite rising inflation in practice costs.

In this administration, and any administration, independent public disagreement isn't welcome.\"",

He helped select Trump's choices to lead the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH. If confirmed, he would lead them from the helm of HHS, with its more than $1.7 trillion budget.",
      "",
      "Clashes are likely. Kennedy has supported access to abortion until a fetus is viable. That puts him at odds with Dave Weldon, MD, the former Florida congressman whom Trump has chosen to run the CDC. Weldon, a physician, is an abortion opponent who wrote one of the major laws allowing health professionals to opt out of participating in the procedure.",

That's at odds with the views of Marty Makary, MD, MPH, a Johns Hopkins surgeon whom Trump plans to nominate for FDA commissioner.

The vaccines were produced through Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership Trump launched in his first term to fast-track the shots as well as other treatments.",

Bhattacharya opposed measures used to curb the spread of COVID in 2020 and advised that everyone except the most vulnerable go about their lives as usual. The World Health Organization warned that such an approach would overwhelm hospitals.",
      "",
      "Mehmet Oz, MD, Trump's choice to head the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an agency within HHS, has said the vaccines were oversold. He promoted the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment. The FDA in 2020 revoked emergency authorization of hydroxychloroquine for COVID, saying that it was unlikely to be effective against the virus and that the risk of dangerous side effects was too high.",

      "The Camp David peace accords, signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978, remain the biggest achievement from decades of mostly failed U.S. peacemaking in the Middle East.",
      "But for Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, they were clouded by what he saw as the continued oppression of the Palestinians and Israel\u2019s expansion of settlements on lands they want for a future state.",
      "Carter did not speak publicly after entering hospice care, months before the outbreak of the latest war in Gaza. But he devoted much of his life during and after his presidency trying to broker a just solution to the wider conflict.",
      "When Carter assumed office in 1977, Egypt and Israel had fought four devastating wars, the last of which began with an Egyptian surprise attack in 1973 that initially seemed to threaten Israel\u2019s existence.",
      "Carter\u2019s efforts led to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s landmark visit to Jerusalem and saw U.S. negotiators eventually wear down the famously hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.",
      "\u201cThere would not be a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt without President Carter,\u201d said Aharon Barak, a former Israeli attorney general and Supreme Court president who served as the Israeli legal adviser during the negotiations.",
      "Barak described Carter as a dogged negotiator, forcing the sides to work from 6 a.m. until after midnight and getting involved in the smallest details.",
      "\u201cHe was very tough, knew what he wanted, and he got what he wanted. And I admired it,\u201d he said.",
      "The first ever peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country saw Israel withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had captured in the 1967 Mideast war, and forge full diplomatic ties with Egypt, which had led the Arab struggle against Israel since its establishment in 1948.",
      "The two countries remain at peace nearly a half-century later.",
      "Although the Camp David agreements called for a transition to Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel also seized in 1967, it was never carried out. Carter was voted out of office two years later amid the Iran hostage crisis, and Mideast peace efforts languished.",
      "When Israelis and Palestinians finally came together to sign the Oslo Accords in 1993, the plan was similar to the one Carter had written 15 years earlier, with the creation of a Palestinian Authority and Israel\u2019s gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories.",
      "But the peace process stalled out yet again in 2000, when the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement at Camp David. An armed Palestinian uprising erupted months later, and Israel launched a heavy military crackdown.",
      "Carter remained actively engaged in the Middle East as a global campaigner for human rights and democracy, with his Carter Center observing Palestinian elections. He spoke out against the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, calling George W. Bush the worst president in the history of foreign affairs.",
      "In speeches, articles and a controversial book titled \u201cPalestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\u201d he called on the Palestinians to renounce violence and for U.S. intervention to end the conflict.",

      "Carter insisted the tough talk was coming from someone who had devoted his life to trying to bring about a lasting peace for Israel, but few Israelis saw it that way. Israel\u2019s supporters said the book was slanted against it and contained a number of inaccuracies.",
      "Israel bristles at any suggestion that its open-ended rule over the Palestinians amounts to apartheid, viewing it as an attack on its very legitimacy. It points to the fact that its own Arab minority has full citizenship, including the right to vote.",
      "Barak rejected the apartheid assertions, saying that as head of the Supreme Court he had presided over numerous rulings in favor of Palestinians against Israeli security bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s not apartheid,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe was a complicated person,\u201d Barak said of Carter. \u201cBut on balance, I think he was a friend of Israel.\u201d",
      "The situation Carter described has only grown worse for the Palestinians. There have been no peace talks in well over a decade, Israel is rapidly expanding settlements, and its far-right government supports outright annexation of parts of the West Bank, making the establishment of a viable Palestinian state virtually impossible.",
      "Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem have meanwhile adopted Carter\u2019s language to describe the conflict, publishing lengthy reports in recent years arguing that Israel is guilty of the international crime of apartheid.",

He once again courted controversy by meeting with the top leaders of the Islamic militant group Hamas, which had recently seized control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas does not accept Israel\u2019s existence and has carried out hundreds of deadly attacks over the years.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers in England have unearthed nearly 200 dinosaur tracks that date back 166 million years",
      "LONDON -- A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.",
      "The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.",
      "\u201cThese footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.",
      "Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 60 feet (18 meters) in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 9-meter predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.",
      "An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.",
      "\u201cScientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.",
      "The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.",
      "\u201cThe preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur\u2019s feet squelched in and out,\" said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. \"Along with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.\u201d",
      "The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's \u201cDigging for Britain\u201d program next week.",

Tehran confirmed Monday that Sala had been arrested on charges of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.",

      "Abedini\u2019s Italian lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco, asked the Milan court this week to grant him house arrest, a decision that is pending, De Francesco said in an email. He declined to respond when asked to comment on the U.S. charges or possible links to the Sala case.",
      "Italian media have reported that Sala is essentially being used as a bargaining chip by Iran to secure Abedini\u2019s release. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani didn\u2019t dispute that scenario when he was asked about it during a call-in to the Rete4 broadcast Sunday.",
      "Ever since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis in Iran, in which dozens of U.S. hostages spent 444 days in captivity in Tehran, Iran has frequently used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations.",

      "\u201cWhat better than to come first to thank God and to ask God to give me the wisdom, the fortitude and the tools to fulfill everything I promised the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d she told reporters.",

She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party\u2019s primary in June.",
      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",

      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",

      "UNICEF called on governments to honor their obligations under international law regarding refugees and to prioritize the safeguarding of children. \u201cThis includes ensuring safe, legal pathways for protection and family reunification, as well as coordinated search and rescue operations, safe disembarkation, community-based reception, and access to asylum services,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Under Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Italy has tried to stem arrivals by cracking down on migrant smuggling operations and deterring would-be refugees with the threat of having their asylum claims processed in Albania.

      "Prabhu didn't appear at the hearing, during which Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Saiful Islam rejected the bail plea, according to Public Prosecutor Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan. Security was tight, with police and soldiers guarding the court.",
      "\u201cHe faces serious charges like sedition and others involving the security and sovereignty of our country,\" Bhuiyan told The Associated Press by phone. \"We argued in the court that if he gets bail it could create anarchy as we saw in the past that he triggered violence on the court premises by calling thousands of his supporters to protest.",

      "Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has issued a defiant statement to his rightwing supporters gathered outside his residence in the capital of Seoul",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a defiant statement to his conservative supporters gathered outside his residence in the capital of Seoul, vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against what he called \u201canti-state forces,\u201d as law enforcement prepared to detain him over last month\u2019s martial law decree.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials has a week to execute its detainment warrant against Yoon, issued by a Seoul court on Tuesday. The warrant came after Yoon defied several requests to appear for questioning and blocked searches of his office, hindering an investigation into whether his short-lived power grab on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion.",
      "Oh Dong-woon, the anti-corruption agency\u2019s chief prosecutor, has indicated that police forces might be deployed if Yoon\u2019s security service resists the detention attempt, which could occur as early as Thursday. But it remains unclear whether Yoon can be compelled to submit to questioning.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team issued a statement on Thursday warning that any attempt by the anti-corruption agency to use police mobile units for his detention would exceed their legal authority. The lawyers further said that police officers could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens\u201d if they try to detain him.",
      "In a message to hundreds of supporters gathered outside his residence Wednesday evening, Yoon said he would continue to fight against anti-state forces \u201cviolating our sovereignty\u201d and putting the nation in \u201cdanger.\u201d He applauded his supporters for their efforts to protect the country\u2019s \u201cliberal democracy and constitutional order\u201d and said he was watching their protests on live YouTube broadcasts, according to a photo of the message shared by Yoon\u2019s lawyers.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative vote that impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the martial law imposition, accused the president of trying to mobilize his supporters to block his detention and called for law enforcement authorities to execute the warrant immediately.",
      "A growing number of Yoon\u2019s supporters were again gathering near his residence on Thursday morning amid a heavy police presence, waving small South Korean and American flags and holding signs opposing his impeachment.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have argued that the court\u2019s detainment warrant is \u201cinvalid,\u201d claiming that the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. They also accuse the court of bypassing a law that says locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "Some experts believe the anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities, would not risk clashing with Yoon\u2019s security service, which has said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law. The office may instead issue another summons for Yoon to appear for questioning if they are not able to execute the detainment warrant by Jan. 6.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended following the National Assembly vote to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. Yoon\u2019s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.",
      "To formally end Yoon\u2019s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had assumed the role of acting president after Yoon\u2019s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court\u2019s review of Yoon\u2019s case.",
      "In the face of growing pressure, the country\u2019s new interim leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which possibly increased the chances of the court upholding Yoon\u2019s impeachment.",
      "Cho Han-chang, one of the newly appointed court justices, said Thursday that he begins his job with a \u201cheavy heart.\u201d Jeong Gye-seon, the other new justice, expressed hope that the remaining vacancy would be filled.",

      "The congress, in which Bukele's party and allies hold a supermajority, continues to renew the special powers each month.",
      "The gangs' repressive control made it difficult and dangerous for residents to travel between neighborhoods, including for work. Now residents say they can walk their neighborhoods without fear.",
      "In February, Bukele romped to victory, winning an unprecedented second five-year term despite a constitutional ban on consecutive reelection. A friendly Supreme Court allowed it."

      "By Wednesday afternoon, power was back up for 98% of Puerto Rico\u2019s 1.47 million utility customers, said Luma Energy, the private company overseeing transmission and distribution of power in the archipelago. Lights returned to households as well as to Puerto Rico\u2019s hospitals, water plants and sewage facilities after the massive outage that exposed the persistent electricity problems plaguing the island.",
      "Still, the company warned that customers could still see temporary outages in the coming days. It said full restoration across the island could take up to two days.",
      "\u201cGiven the fragile nature of the grid, we will need to manage available generation to customer demand, which will likely require rotating temporary outages,\u201d Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, said in a statement.",
      "The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday, darkening almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New Year. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the outage, but Luma Energy said a preliminary review pointed to a failure in an underground electric line in the south of the territory.",
      "Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, who is set to take office on Thursday, warned that customers might experience interruptions in the coming days, with power plants not yet operating at maximum capacity.",

In June, over 340,000 customers were left without electricity as people reeled from soaring temperatures. At the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, in August, over half of all utility customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity a week after the storm.",
      "The New Year\u2019s Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico\u2019s Energy Bureau approved an increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from January through March, causing electric bills for the average household to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau says."

      "Russian officials have warned of severe environmental damage as thousands of people came out to clean up tons of fuel oil that spilled out of two storm-stricken tankers more than two weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, near Moscow-occupied Crimea",
      "Russian officials warned of severe environmental damage Wednesday as thousands of people came out to clean up tons of fuel oil that spilled out of two storm-stricken tankers more than two weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, near Moscow-occupied Crimea.",
      "More than 10,000 people, largely volunteers, raced to rescue wildlife and remove tons of sand saturated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product, according to Russian news reports.",
      "Authorities in Russia\u2019s southern Krasnodar region last week announced a region-wide emergency, as the fuel oil continued washing up on the coastline 10 days after one tanker ran aground and the other was left damaged and adrift on Dec. 15.",
      "The move came days after Russian President Vladimir Putin called the oil spill an \u201cecological disaster.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, New Year\u2019s Day, Krasnodar officials said the oil kept on surfacing on the beaches of Anapa, a popular local resort.",
      "More than 71,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil had been removed along 56 kilometers (35 miles) of shoreline since the original spill, Russia\u2019s emergencies ministry reported on Wednesday morning.",
      "On Dec. 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated.",
      "Some Russian media critical of the Kremlin cited Russian volunteers as saying that state support has been inadequate as they grapple with the consequences of the spill. Some said they experienced headaches, nausea and vomiting after spending hours inhaling toxic fumes, and complained of insufficient equipment and protective measures.",
      "Others called for international specialists to be sent in, citing the scale of the spill and the likely extent of the impact.",
      "Photos circulating on social media and local news channels showed seabirds coated in black fuel oil.",
      "The spill may have killed more than 20 dolphins, the local Delfa dolphin rescue centre said, adding tests were ongoing to ascertain the cause of the deaths.",
      "The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.",
      "It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.",
      "Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, last month described the oil spill as a \u201clarge-scale environmental disaster\u201d and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers."

      "Protesters in Syria have held a sit-in demanding justice for four activists who were forcibly disappeared in 2013 and whose fate remains one of the most haunting mysteries of the country\u2019s 13-year civil war",
      "DOUMA, Syria -- Protesters in Syria held a sit-in Wednesday demanding justice for four activists who were forcibly disappeared in 2013 and whose fate remains one of the most haunting mysteries of the country's 13-year civil war.",
      "On Dec. 9, 2013, gunmen stormed the Violation Documentation Center in Douma, northeast of Damascus, and took Razan Zaitouneh, her husband Wael Hamadeh, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi.",
      "Outspoken and defiantly secular, Zaitouneh was one of Syria\u2019s most well-known human rights activists. Perhaps most dangerously, she was impartial. She chanted in protests against then-President Bashar Assad but was also unflinching in documenting abuses by rebels fighting to oust him.",
      "There has been no sign of life nor proof of death since she and her colleagues were abducted.",
      "Since the ouster of Assad on Dec. 8, protests have erupted across Syria demanding information about thousands of people who were forcibly disappeared under his rule. The new leadership under the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which orchestrated the offensive to oust Assad, has maintained a neutral stance regarding accusations against various armed groups for forcibly disappearing activists. At the same time, HTS has aligned with activists in their efforts to uncover the truth and seek justice.",
      "\u201cWe are gathering here to remind the world of their case,\u201d Yassin Haj Saleh, Khalil\u2019s husband, said Wednesday, adding that the disappearance of activists represents \u201cthe deepest wounds\u201d of Syria\u2019s conflict. \u201cThis is the first opportunity that allows us to be in Douma, and in front of the place that they were kidnapped from, to speak up about the case, taking advantage of the political change that took place in the country.\u201d",
      "Saleh said they had repeatedly appealed to various armed groups for cooperation in finding the four activists in the years before Assad's ouster but were met with silence.",
      "Strong clues had pointed to the Army of Islam, the most powerful rebel faction in Douma at the time, as the perpetrators. The group, made up of religious hard-liners who were pushing out other rebels and imposing strict Shariah rules, long denied involvement. An Army of Islam official, Hamza Bayraqdar, told The Associated Press in 2018 they brought Zaitouneh to Douma to protect her from the Assad government.",
      "The Army of Islam repeatedly blamed the Assad government, along with the Nusra Front \u2014 an al-Qaida-linked group originally founded by the current HTS leader \u2014 for his wife's disappearance, Saleh said.",
      "Zaitouneh was a prominent human rights lawyer and founder of the Violation Documentation Center. She also helped organize networks of activists like the Local Coordination Committees, an umbrella network made up of activists who organized protests as part of the Syrian uprising.",
      "Her work earned her international recognition, including an International Woman of Courage award presented by U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in 2013.",
      "Several of those who spoke to the AP in 2018 said the Army of Islam saw Zaitouneh documenting abuses as a threat and resented her local administration plan as an encroachment on their power. Zaitouneh received a series of threats that friends and activists said traced back to the Army of Islam.",
      "The Army of Islam was forced to move north in 2018 after the Assad government retook Douma, leading to the group's weakening and disintegration. Hopes that Zaitouneh and her colleagues would emerge among released prisoners during that time were unmet.",
      "Today, the Army of Islam remains an armed faction backed by Turkey. It did not fight alongside the other Islamist factions that led the offensive against Assad and remains excluded from the HTS-led Syrian leadership. Recently, an Army of Islam delegation met HTS leader Ahmad Sharaa to explore integration into the new Syrian system, but no agreement has been reached.",
      "Protesters on Wednesday held banners openly accusing the Army of Islam and reading \u201cFreedom\u201d in English and \u201cTraitor who kidnaps a revolutionary\u201d in Arabic, alongside posters of the four missing activists.",
      "Saleh described the plight of the disappeared as uniquely painful, saying, \u201cThose who die are mourned, but the forcibly disappeared are forbidden from both living and being mourned.\u201d",
      "Their bodies must be found, he said, adding: \u201cFor Syria to heal, truth and justice must prevail.\u201d",
      "Wafa Moustafa, whose father was forcibly disappeared separately in 2013, also attended the protest.",
      "\u201cJustice in Syria cannot be limited to those detained by the Assad regime,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many years, other factions controlled parts of Syria and committed similar crimes of detention, torture and killing. If justice does not include all victims, it will remain incomplete and threaten Syria\u2019s future.\u201d",

      "New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has already taken several actions to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene",
      "ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein took several actions on Thursday to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene, with an immediate focus on more temporary housing and repairs to private bridges and roads.",
      "Stein, who took his oath of office on Wednesday to succeed fellow Democrat Roy Cooper, traveled to Asheville and \u2014 with legislators and officials from both parties behind him \u2014 announced he had signed five executive orders related to the historic flooding in late September in western North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe needs facing this region are vast and require immediate attention,\u201d Stein said at a news conference. \u201cI pledge to do everything in my power as governor to accelerate recovery of the rebuilding of a more resilient region for the long haul.\u201d",
      "Over 100 people died in North Carolina because of Helene, which state officials estimate caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Billions of dollars from the federal and state government already have been spent or earmarked for the recovery, and Congress last month committed at least another $9 billion in aid. But more must be done this winter to put more people in warm and safe housing on their own property, and to restore vital transportation links between small communities as well as first responders and school buses, Stein said.",
      "One executive order allows the state Department of Public Safety to purchase up to 1,000 temporary housing units through the end of next month without going through the usual state procurement and bidding processes. Stein said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the costs of these units. FEMA is already following another regulatory process as it installs similar trailers on its own, he added.",
      "Stein also delegated to the Division of Emergency Management the ability to hire repair contractors for private bridges and roads without procurement requirements. It also lets environmental regulators waive rules to speed up permitting and inspections.",
      "More than 12,000 western North Carolinians are displaced from their homes due to Helene, which also caused significant damage to more than 8,000 private roads and bridges, Stein's orders said.",
      "\u201cWhen I have met with affected folks here in the mountains, the need for housing assistance and the repairing of private bridges and roads has come up in nearly every conversation,\" he said. \u201cWestern North Carolina \u2014 I want you to know that I hear you.\u201d",
      "Another Stein order creates a new Governor\u2019s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina and establishes within the Commerce Department a Division of Community Revitalization that in part will oversee the rebuilding of homes destroyed or damaged by Helene.",
      "The North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which was created during Cooper's administration, will stick to rebuilding homes in eastern North Carolina harmed by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, Stein said. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly have been angry with the pace of the agency's work and a fiscal shortfall for ongoing housing projects.",
      "Stein also issued an order giving many state employees more paid leave this year to volunteer for Helene-related recovery efforts, and he agreed to continue a Helene recovery advisory committee that he created after his November election victory. GOP state Sen. Kevin Corbin, who has co-chaired the panel with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, said Thursday that Stein's actions were \u201cbipartisan commonsense solutions.\"",
      "New State Auditor Dave Boliek, also a Republican, released a statement later Thursday telling Stein that his department would hold Stein's office accountable on how money stemming from the orders gets spent.",
      "\u201cGiven past failures to effectively provide hurricane relief to Eastern North Carolina, it is in the best interest of Hurricane Helene victims that our office takes such action,\" Boliek said."

      "Canada\u2019s WestJet, Air Canada and Denver-based budget airline Frontier finished at the bottom of the pack among U.S. and Canadian carriers, with on-time ratings below 72%.",
      "Other regional winners around the globe, according to Cirium, were Japan Airlines, low-cost Spanish carrier Iberia Express, Panama\u2019s Copa Airlines, and South African low-cost carrier FlySafair.",
      "Cirium said the best airport for on-time departures in 2024 was King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Nearly 87% of flights from there took off within 15 minutes of their scheduled time, Cirium said.",
      "Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima, Peru, and Mexico City's Benito Ju\u00e1rez International Airport had the next-best departure records at over 84%. Delta took the top spot among U.S. airlines despite disruptions in July from an outage that followed a faulty upgrade that cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike sent to Microsoft computers around the world.",
      "Delta sued CrowdStrike, claiming the outage cost the airline $500 million. CrowdStrike has defended itself partly by arguing that other airlines recovered much more quickly from the outage.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n was sworn in Thursday as Puerto Rico\u2019s new governor during a normally ebullient ceremony held amid widespread anger over a blackout that hit the U.S. territory days ago.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a Republican who backs President-elect Donald Trump and whose pro-statehood New Progressive Party secured a historic third consecutive term after she won the Nov. 5 election, has pledged to stabilize the Caribbean island\u2019s crumbling power grid.",
      "\u201cThere are many challenges facing our island,\u201d she said in her first public address as governor as she acknowledged the blackout in a speech to a crowd gathered in front of the seaside Capitol. \u201cThat is precisely what moves me to address that first challenge with a sense of urgency.\u201d",
      "She pledged to improve Puerto Rico's infrastructure, hospitals and schools, adding that she intends to boost bilingual education.",

      "Meanwhile, a small group of protesters gathered at the Capitol before Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s arrival. They were especially rankled that a well-known, outspoken activist elected to Puerto Rico's Senate for the first time was not allowed inside the Capitol, with the elections commission noting he had not yet been officially certified.",
      "Protesting the ceremony was Yara Humar\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, an aquatic physical therapist whose 83-year-old mother remains without power.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any hope that she will change anything,\u201d she said of the new governor.",

      "Outages were still being reported on Thursday as crews tried to stabilize the grid following the blackout that hit early Tuesday, leaving 1.3 million customers in the dark as Puerto Ricans prepared for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "While electricity had been restored to 99% of the utility's 1.47 million total customers, more than 600,000 were temporarily left without power on New Year\u2019s Day when part of the system collapsed again, according to Luma.",
      "\u201cThe stability of the system is fragile,\u201d Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. \u201cWe know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.\u201d",
      "Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform.",
      "The anticipated revelry was characteristic of Gonz\u00e1lez, a 48-year-old attorney and recent mother of twins who prior to the election showed up at her party\u2019s assembly wearing a Wonder Woman tiara and cuffs. She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Supporters and critics gathered for the ceremony, some clutching umbrellas to shield themselves from the blistering sun.",
      "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s going to be a great governor,\u201d said Amanda S\u00e1nchez Le\u00f3n, a retired government employee, who arrived two hours early to secure a spot outside an area reserved for guests. She said she was hopeful that Gonz\u00e1lez would reduce violent crimes and improve education and health, \u201cespecially for us older people.\u201d She also believed the power crisis would improve and that Gonz\u00e1lez would see her promises through.",
      "\u201cThe people are suffering,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party\u2019s primary in June.",
      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",
      "After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",
      "While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections, and officials with the New Progressive Party have noted the island receives unequal treatment when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal programs.",
      "\u201cStatehood means equality, and I want us to have that access to opportunities,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI want to have those opportunities here so that our people can move forward.\u201d"

      "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Opponents of the nation's largest lithium mine under construction want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project in Nevada already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail being considered for endangered species protection.",
      "Environmentalists and Native American activists are demanding that the U.S. Interior Department address what they say is new evidence that bolsters their concerns about Lithium Americas\u2019 planned open pit mine at Thacker Pass. The footprint of mine operations will span about 9 square miles (23 square kilometers).",
      "The fate of the snail takes center stage after a federal judge and an appeals court dismissed a previous attempt by Native American tribes to get federal agencies to recognize the sacred nature of the area. The tribes argued that the mine would infringe on lands where U.S. troops massacred dozens of their ancestors in 1865.",
      "Now, Western Watersheds Project and the group known as People of Red Mountain argue in a notice of intent to sue that the government and Canada-based Lithium Americas are failing to live up to promises to adequately monitor groundwater impacts.",
      "They say it\u2019s alarming that an analysis of groundwater data from a nearby well that was conducted by Payton Gardner, an assistant professor of hydrogeology at the University of Montana, shows a drop in the water table of nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) since 2018. Nevada regulators say they have no information so far that would confirm declining levels but have vowed to monitor the situation during the mine's lifespan.",
      "Not much bigger than a grain of rice, the Kings River pyrg has managed to survive in 13 isolated springs within the basin surrounding the mine site. It\u2019s the only place in the world where the snail lives.",
      "In some cases, the tiny creatures require only a few centimeters of water. But the margin for survival becomes more narrow if the groundwater system that feeds the springs begins to drop, said Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project.",
      "\u201cEven slight disruptions to its habitat could cause springs to run dry, driving it to extinction,\u201d he said.",
      "Western Watersheds Project and the other opponents say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to rule in a timely fashion on a 2022 petition to list the snail as threatened or endangered. The allegations outlined in the opponents' notice follow requests for federal biologists to investigate whether groundwater drawdowns are being caused by exploratory drilling and other activities and whether there have been impacts to the springs.",
      "Without protection, Ruprecht fears the snail \u201cwill become another casualty of the lithium boom.\u201d",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a review of the snail's status, but the agency declined to comment on the requests for an investigation into the groundwater concerns.",
      "Efforts to mine gold and other minerals in Nevada and other parts of the West over the decades have spurred plenty of legal skirmishes over potential threats to wildlife and water supplies. Lithium is no exception, as demand for the metal critical to making batteries for electric vehicles is expected to continue to climb exponentially over the next decade.",
      "President Joe Biden made increased production of electric vehicles central to his energy agenda, and the U.S. Energy Department last year agreed to loan Lithium Americas more than $2 billion to help finance construction at Thacker Pass. On Dec. 23, Lithium Americas announced it had concluded a joint venture with General Motors Holdings LLC to develop and operate the mine.",
      "The mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Reno is the biggest in the works and closest to fruition in the U.S., followed by Ioneer\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge project near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "And the Bureau of Land Management announced in late December that it was seeking comments on another proposed project in northeastern Nevada. Surge Battery Metals USA wants to explore for lithium in Elko County.",
      "Ruprecht said reports filed by Lithium Americas\u2019 environmental consultant with state regulators show the company no longer has permission to access private lands where several monitoring wells are located. That makes it harder to tell if flows have been impacted by past drilling, he said.",
      "Nevada regulators say they approved changes in 2024 to the monitoring plan to account for the loss of access to wells on private land.",
      "Prior data showed groundwater levels had remained stable from the 1960s to 2018. Construction started at the site in 2023.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the mine acknowledged some reduction in groundwater levels were possible but not for decades, and most likely would occur only if state regulators granted the company permission to dig below the water table.",
      "Lithium Americas spokesman Tim Crowley said it appears the mine\u2019s opponents are \u201cworking to re-spin issues that have previously been addressed and resolved in court.\u201d He pointed to 10 years of data collection by the company indicating the snail would not be affected by the project."

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network, almost three years into Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of its neighbor",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network after a prewar transit deal expired at the end of 2024 and almost three years into Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country\u2019s pipeline network \u2014 set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union \u2014 to Europe, under a five-year agreement.",
      "Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit \u201cin the interest of national security.\"",
      "\u201cThis is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses,\" Halushchenko said Wednesday on the Telegram messaging app. \"Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas, and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today.\u201d",
      "At a summit in Brussels last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn \u201cadditional billions ... on our blood, on the lives of our citizens.\u201d However, he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.",
      "Gazprom said in a statement Wednesday it \u201chas no technical and legal possibility\u201d of sending gas through Ukraine, due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.",
      "Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.",
      "After the war started, Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines, citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky.",
      "The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the United States filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers.",
      "Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that halting the transits would see Moscow lose \u201cone of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets\u201d for its gas. In a post on X, he said Russia was \u201cresorting to cynical blackmail of partners.\u201d",
      "Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023, according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia, which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.",
      "Gazprom halted supplies to Austria\u2019s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, but gas flows through Ukraine\u2019s pipelines continued as other customers stepped in. Slovakia this year inked deals to begin buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, and also to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.",
      "Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova, which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.",
      "Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire, Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies, a figure the country has fiercely disputed.",
      "Heating and hot water supplies were abruptly cut off Wednesday to households in Transnistria, Moldova\u2019s breakaway region that has for decades hosted Russian troops, as Russian natural gas stopped flowing to the territory, local transit operator Tiraspoltransgaz-Transnistria said.",
      "In an online statement, the company urged residents to gather household members together in a single room, hang blankets over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters. It said some key facilities, including hospitals, were exempt from the cuts.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as fears mounted that the gas shortages could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, for decades dependent on Russian energy supplies.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force people in the separatist territory to travel to Moldova proper, seeking basic amenities to get through the harsh winter and placing further strain on resources.",
      "Moldova, Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.",
      "On Wednesday, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a win for those opposed to the Kremlin's policies. In a post on X, Sikorski accused Moscow of systematic attempts to \u201cblackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies,\" including through a Baltic pipeline bypassing Ukraine and Poland and running directly to Germany.",
      "Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed Wednesday the end of gas flows via Ukraine \u201cwill drastically affect us all in the EU but not Russia.\u201d",
      "Fico, whose views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream, has previously criticized Kyiv's refusal to extend the transit deal, and threatened to end electricity supplies to Ukraine in response.",
      "Moscow can still send gas to Hungary, as well as non-EU states Turkey and Serbia, through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.",
      "The steady reduction of Russian gas supplies to European countries has also spurred them to hasten the integration of Ukraine\u2019s energy grids with its neighbors to the west.",
      "Last week, private Ukrainian energy utility DTEK said it had received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the U.S., delivered through a newly expanded network spanning six countries from Greece to Ukraine \u2014 a significant step in reducing regional dependence on Russian energy.",
      "Separately, overnight into New Year's Day, Russia launched a drone strike on Kyiv that left two people dead under the rubble of a damaged building, according to the city administration. At least six people were wounded across the Ukrainian capital, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.",
      "Russian shelling also killed a man and wounded two women in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, regional authorities reported.",

    "story": [
      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

    "story": [
      "Moldovans are bracing for a difficult winter ahead as a looming energy shortage could leave them without enough energy",
      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- On a frigid morning in Moldova\u2019s capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with \u201cno heating, no light.\u201d",
      "His concerns aren\u2019t unfounded.",
      "On Jan. 1, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country.",
      "\u201cI feel that we\u2019ve entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve \u2026 which worries me greatly,\u201d Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. \u201cPrice increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that\u2019s something entirely different.\u201d",
      "The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper.",
      "\u201cThere will be no heating, no light,\u201d Murzin added. \u201cWe are entering a very difficult year.\"",
      "Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, says that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a \u201cpotential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova\u2019s already-strained resources\u201d to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol.",
      "\u201cIt could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue\u201d ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said.",
      "The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to save power till we have a solution,\u201d said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.\u201d",
      "After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy \"as a political weapon\u201d and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been \u201cinvalidated by an international audit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,\u201d he said.",
      "For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid, but we\u2019re happy that there\u2019s no snow and the temperatures aren\u2019t that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I work from home and I\u2019ll be directly affected.\u201d",
      "She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, \u201cBut regarding power and gas, it\u2019s the first time we face this,\u201d she said.",
      "Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom\u2019s decision and said that the country has gas supplies \u201cfor the heating season\u201d and measures will be taken \u201cto ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,\u201d adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.\u201d",
      "Olga Rosca, an adviser to Sandu, told the AP that most of Moldova, excluding Transnistria, \u201cshouldn\u2019t see major disruptions\u201d and that \u201ccheaper electricity previously supplied from Transnistria will be replaced by more expensive imports from the EU.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Transnistrian region, however, the situation will be much more serious,\u201d she said, \u201cand any crisis there will inevitably affect all of Moldova.\"",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast \u201chybrid war\u201d by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations.",
      "The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn\u2019t recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation to potentially recover \u201cstrategic assets that were forcefully taken over,\u201d referring to Moldovagaz, Moldova\u2019s main gas operator in which Gazprom owns a majority stake.",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz.",
      "In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant.",
      "When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets.",
      "Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits.",
      "\u201cI think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people will come here, hoping for warmth.\"",

      "People in Zimbabwe are shunning traditional grocery stores to do their shopping at informal and illegal markets that pop up at night to avoid police raids rampant during the day",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space \u2014 an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.",
      "From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.",
      "Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it\u2019s much cheaper than the supermarkets,\u201d 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. \u201cI decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get \u201cmeat and spices and they were not even that much.\u201d",
      "The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.",
      "It is the country\u2019s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world\u2019s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.",
      "The latest currency, the world\u2019s newest, came with pomp and fanfare \u2014 promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.",
      "Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.",
      "Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.",
      "It warned of store closures, saying the situation is \u201cclearly untenable.\u201d",
      "In October, Pick n Pay, one of Africa\u2019s biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had \u2018impaired\u201d its investment in Zimbabwe \u201cto a book value of zero\u201d because of the \u201cdeteriorating economic conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, it\u2019s making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis,\u201d said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers\u2019 situation.",
      "\u201cEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they don\u2019t care. They are there for survival,\u201d Mugano said.",
      "The contrast is palpable in Harare\u2019s Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.",
      "Soothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.",
      "\u201cBusiness is booming,\u201d said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.",
      "Gari, 51, said he's fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.",
      "More than 80% of Zimbabwe\u2019s employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.",
      "For Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite confusing, especially for people like me who really don\u2019t understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets,\u201d he said.",
      "He was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.",
      "\u201cI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I will do this more often.\u201d"

      "A looming TikTok ban could affect the millions of small businesses that use the short-video social media app to help them grow their business.",
      "Desiree Hill, owner of Crown\u2019s Corner Mechanic in Conyers, Georgia, started her business solo as a mobile mechanic. Sharing videos of her work on TikTok helped spread the word and she became so popular she was able to open a 9,000 square foot brick and mortar shop with five employees 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cEvery day I get at least two to three customers that have seen me on TikTok, watched my videos and wanted to become a customer,\u201d she said.",
      "Though TikTok has been around only since 2016, small business owners use the platform in a variety of ways, from growing a customer base to advertising and marketing, as well as selling goods directly from the site.",
      "According to TikTok's own estimates, small businesses on TikTok would lose more than $1 billion in revenue in a single month if the ban goes into effect.",
      "The Justice Department ordered the app's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban by Jan. 19, citing security concerns. The Supreme Court will take up the matter in January. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has asked the Supreme Court for a delay.",
      "If a ban does occur, small businesses will have to migrate to other platforms to find their customers. Instagram Reels, SnapChat and YouTube Shorts are alternatives. The good news is brands likely already have a presence there. But it may be harder to reach teens that have made TikTok their preferred social media app.",
      "Another alternative is to build a strong database of customers that opt in to providing contact emails or phone numbers. That lets owners reach out directly to customers with promotions and other marketing messages.",
      "But Crown Corner Mechanic's Hill said she is worried that other sites may not have the reach that TikTok does. She has a presence on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, but it's not the same, she said.",
      "\u201cI am worried because there is no preparation for this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt holds such a significant place in regards to my customer base and how I reach customers that if I lose TikTok, I will lose a large part of my business or I will lose my ability to grow anymore.\u201d",
      "Crystal Lister is the owner of Mommy and Me: The Listers, in Cypress, Texas, which offers interactive workshops about STEM education. She's working on pivoting to YouTube for videos and Instagram Reels for teasers to direct people to YouTube, but said TikTok is easier.",
      "\u201cIt is going to be a challenge if TikTok is banned because we\u2019re losing kind of all the functionality you want \u2014 the ability for a video creation, the ability to spread the word via social media,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have to use many other platforms to supplement what TikTok did in one.\u201d",

      "Earnings for companies within the S&P 500 are expected to have grown by about 9.4% in 2024, according to FactSet",
      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street expects corporate profits to have surged in 2024 and forecasts an even stronger jump for 2025.",
      "Companies still face a long list of uncertainties in the year ahead, including economic policy shifts, reheated inflation and shifts in the jobs market and consumer spending.",
      "Earnings for companies within the S&P 500 are expected to have grown by about 9.4% in 2024, according to FactSet. Companies will start reporting their final quarterly financial results for that year in the next few weeks. It will mark a sharp gain from 1.4% growth in 2023.",
      "Profit growth for companies followed the rising economic tide. The labor market remained strong, helping support consumer spending for goods and services. Prices remain high on many items and services, but the rate of inflation has eased significantly, helping companies lower costs in some cases and relieving some pressure on consumers.",
      "Wall Street's 2025 forecast for over 12% profit growth relies largely on those conditions continuing to prevail. Earnings will be closely-watched as a key measure to justify the broader markets gains.",
      "\u201cWith the market looking expensive versus history, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if earnings growth were a greater driver of market performance than in recent years, making companies\u2019 ability to deliver on profitability estimates all the more critical in 2025,\" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird Private Wealth Management, in a research note.",
      "The Federal Reserve's path ahead for interest rates also remains a factor for companies and consumers looking for less pressure on borrowing costs. The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate three times in 2024.",
      "Expectations for further cuts have been tempered by worries over stubborn inflation. The rate of inflation had eased but remains stuck just above the Fed's target rate of 2%. Recent months have shown signs that it even edged higher.",
      "The Fed has signaled more caution because of inflation worries. Tariff threats from incoming President Donald Trump have fueled those worries on Wall Street. Trump has threatened blanket tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S., which in itself would raise prices for imported goods and raw materials for companies, which typically pass those costs along to consumers. Other nations would likely respond with retaliatory tariffs, which would almost certainly add to pressure on prices for businesses and consumers.",
      "The incoming administration is expected to have a more permissive regulatory attitude for businesses. That could help ease costs for businesses and potentially result in a boost to mergers and acquisitions if there is less antitrust oversight. But, stricter immigration measures could jolt the labor market by producing labor shortages and raising labor costs for employers, adding to inflation.",
      "\u201cThe effects of tariffs, immigration restrictions, deregulation, and tax cuts on inflation and broader economic performance vary significantly depending on when and how these policies are implemented,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, president of SS Economics, in a research note.",

      "Just over two years after the debut of ChatGPT, the world is getting a little savvier about what artificial intelligence technology can do for us and what it\u2019s not so great at",
      "If 2023 was a year of wonder about artificial intelligence, 2024 was the year to try to get that wonder to do something useful without breaking the bank.",
      "There was a \u201cshift from putting out models to actually building products,\u201d said Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton University computer science professor and co-author of the new book \u201cAI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can\u2019t, and How to Tell The Difference.\u201d",
      "The first 100 million or so people who experimented with ChatGPT upon its release two years ago actively sought out the chatbot, finding it amazingly helpful at some tasks or laughably mediocre at others.",
      "Now such generative AI technology is baked into an increasing number of technology services whether we're looking for it or not \u2014 for instance, through the AI-generated answers in Google search results or new AI techniques in photo editing tools.",
      "\u201cThe main thing that was wrong with generative AI last year is that companies were releasing these really powerful models without a concrete way for people to make use of them,\u201d said Narayanan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this year is gradually building out these products that can take advantage of those capabilities and do useful things for people.\"",
      "At the same time, since OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023 and competitors introduced similarly performing AI large language models, these models have stopped getting significantly \u201cbigger and qualitatively better,\" resetting overblown expectations that AI was racing every few months to some kind of better-than-human intelligence, Narayanan said. That's also meant that the public discourse has shifted from \u201cis AI going to kill us?\u201d to treating it like a normal technology, he said.",
      "On quarterly earnings calls this year, tech executives often heard questions from Wall Street analysts looking for assurances of future payoffs from huge spending on AI research and development. Building AI systems behind generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini requires investing in energy-hungry computing systems running on powerful and expensive AI chips. They require so much electricity that tech giants announced deals this year to tap into nuclear power to help run them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of capital that has been poured into this technology,\u201d said Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan.",
      "Another analyst at the New York investment bank drew attention over the summer by arguing AI isn't solving the complex problems that would justify its costs. He also questioned whether AI models, even as they're being trained on much of the written and visual data produced over the course of human history, will ever be able to do what humans do so well. Rangan has a more optimistic view.",
      "\u201cWe had this fascination that this technology is just going to be absolutely revolutionary, which it has not been in the two years since the introduction of ChatGPT,\u201d Rangan said. \"It\u2019s more expensive than we thought and it\u2019s not as productive as we thought.\"",
      "Rangan, however, is still bullish about its potential and says that AI tools are already proving \u201cabsolutely incrementally more productive\u201d in sales, design and a number of other professions.",
      "Some workers wonder whether AI tools will be used to supplement their work or to replace them as the technology continues to grow. The tech company Borderless AI has been using an AI chatbot from Cohere to write up employment contracts for workers in Turkey or India without the help of outside lawyers or translators.",
      "Video game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists who went on strike in July said they feared AI could reduce or eliminate job opportunities because it could be used to replicate one performance into a number of other movements without their consent. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year\u2019s film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months. Game companies have also signed side agreements with the union that codify certain AI protections in order to keep working with actors during the strike.",
      "Musicians and authors have voiced similar concerns over AI scraping their voices and books. But generative AI still can't create unique work or \u201ccompletely new things,\u201d said Walid Saad, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and AI expert at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cWe can train it with more data so it has more information. But having more information doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cAs humans, we understand the world around us, right? We understand the physics. You understand if you throw a ball on the ground, it\u2019s going to bounce. AI tools currently don\u2019t understand the world.\u201d",
      "AI can mimic what it learns from patterns, he said, but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand the world so that they reason on what happens in the future.\u201d That, he said, is where AI falls short.",
      "\u201cIt still cannot imagine things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that imagination is what we hope to achieve later.\u201d",
      "Saad pointed to a meme about AI as an example of that shortcoming. When someone prompted an AI engine to create an image of salmon swimming in a river, he said, the AI created a photo of a river with cut pieces of salmon found in grocery stores.",
      "\u201cWhat AI lacks today is the common sense that humans have, and I think that is the next step,\u201d he said.",
      "That type of reasoning is a key part of the process of making AI tools more useful to consumers, said Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president of Cisco's innovation and incubation arm, Outshift. AI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI \u201cagents\u201d that can do more useful things on people\u2019s behalf.",
      "That could mean being able to ask an AI agent an ambiguous question and have the model able to reason and plan out steps to solving an ambitious problem, Pandey said. A lot of technology, he said, is going to move in that direction in 2025.",
      "Pandey predicts that eventually, AI agents will be able to come together and perform a job the way multiple people come together and solve a problem as a team rather than simply accomplishing tasks as individual AI tools. The AI agents of the future will work as an ensemble, he said.",
      "Future Bitcoin software, for example, will likely rely on the use of AI software agents, Pandey said. Those agents will each have a specialty, he said, with \u201cagents that check for correctness, agents that check for security, agents that check for scale.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting to an agentic future,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these agents being very good at certain skills, but also have a little bit of a character or color to them, because that\u2019s how we operate.\u201d",
      "AI tools have also streamlined, or lent in some cases a literal helping hand, to the medical field. This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry \u2014 one of two Nobels awarded to AI-related science \u2014 went to work led by Google that could help discover new medicines.",
      "Saad, the Virginia Tech professor, said that AI has helped bring faster diagnostics by quickly giving doctors a starting point to launch from when determining a patient's care. AI can't detect disease, he said, but it can quickly digest data and point out potential problem areas for a real doctor to investigate. As with other arenas, however, it poses a risk of perpetuating falsehoods.",
      "Tech giant OpenAI has touted its AI-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy,\u201d for example. But experts have said that Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences.",
      "Pandey, of Cisco, said that some of the company's customers who work in pharmaceuticals have noted that AI has helped bridge the divide between \u201cwet labs,\u201d in which humans conduct physical experiments and research, and \u201cdry labs\u201d where people analyze data and often use computers for modeling.",
      "When it comes to pharmaceutical development, that collaborative process can take several years, he said \u2014 with AI, the process can be cut to a few days.",
      "\"That, to me, has been the most dramatic use,\" Pandey said."

      "South Korean officials plan to conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a weekend plane crash that killed 179 people",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country\u2019s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon\u2019s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country\u2019s aircraft operation systems.",
      "\u201cThe essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\u201d said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren\u2019t immediately clear. Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a \u201cproven airplane\u201d that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "But South Korea's Transport Ministry said Monday it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country\u2019s airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They said there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",
      "Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul\u2019s Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",
      "Joo said officials were reviewing whether there might have been communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot. \u201cOur current understanding is that, at some point during the go-around process, communication became somewhat ineffective or was interrupted, ahead of the landing and impact,\u201d he said.",
      "Ministry officials said Monday the plane\u2019s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33.",
      "Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families.",
      "\u201cI demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\u201d he said, choking down tears.",
      "The crash was yet more major news for South Koreans already reeling from a political crisis set off by Yoon\u2019s martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law inforcement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has led to concerns.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply worried whether the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,\u201d the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial Monday."

      "The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and aviation experts were quick to distinguish Sunday's incident from the company\u2019s earlier safety problems.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines who is now a consultant, said it would be inappropriate to link the incident Sunday to two fatal crashes involving Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. In January this year, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 that crash-landed in Korea, Price noted, is \u201ca very proven airplane. \"It\u2019s different from the Max ...It\u2019s a very safe airplane.\u2019\u2019",
      "For decades, Boeing has maintained a role as one of the giants of American manufacturing. But the the past year's repeated troubles have been damaging. The company's stock price is down more than 30% in 2024.",
      "The company's reputation for safety was especially tarnished by the 737 Max crashes, which occurred off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and left a combined 346 people dead. In the five years since then, Boeing has lost more than $23 billion. And it has fallen behind its European rival, Airbus, in selling and delivering new planes.",
      "Last fall, 33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike, crippling the production of the 737 Max, the company's bestseller, the 777 airliner and 767 cargo plane. The walkout lasted seven weeks, until members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to an offer that included 38% pay raises over four years.",
      "In January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. Federal regulators responded by imposing limits on Boeing aircraft production that they said would remain in place until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved the 737 Max. Acting on Boeing\u2019s incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from Airbus instead. (Prosecutors said they lacked evidence to argue that Boeing\u2019s deception had played a role in the crashes.)",
      "But the plea deal was rejected this month by a federal judge in Texas, Reed O\u2019Connor, who decided that diversity, inclusion and equity or DEI policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in choosing an official to oversee Boeing\u2019s compliance with the agreement.",
      "Boeing has sought to change its culture. Under intense pressure over safety issues, David Calhoun departed as CEO in August. Since January, 70,000 Boeing employees have participated in meetings to discuss ways to improve safety."

      "Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That\u2019s why we have them,\" Trump said.",
      "In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a \u201cHire American\u201d policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",

      "\u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program,\" Trump told the newspaper.",
      "He did not appear to address questions about whether he would pursue any changes to the number or use of the visas once he takes office Jan. 20.",
      "Trump's hardline immigration policies, focused mostly on immigrants who are in the country illegally, were a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and a priority issue for his supporters.",

      "Variety Wholesalers Inc., which owns more than 400 discount stores in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, plans to acquire between 200 and 400 Big Lots stores and operate them under the Big Lots brand. Variety Wholesalers will also acquire up to two distribution centers.",
      "\u201cThis sale agreement and transfer present the strongest opportunity to preserve jobs, maximize value for the estate and ensure continuity of the Big Lots brand,\u201d Big Lots President and CEO Bruce Thorn said in a statement. \"We are grateful to our associates nationwide for their grit and resilience throughout this process.\u201d",
      "Columbus, Ohio-based Big Lots sells furniture, home decor and other items. When it filed for bankruptcy in September, it said inflation and high interest rates caused consumers to pull back on their purchases of home and seasonal products, two categories the chain depends on for a significant part of its revenue.",
      "At the time, Big Lots planned to sell its assets and ongoing business operations to private equity firm Nexus Capital Management.",
      "But on Dec. 20, Big Lots said the deal with Nexus didn't materialize. It then partnered with Gordon Brothers to conduct going-out-of-business sales at its 869 U.S. locations."

      "Texas will be a whole lot closer to home than Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl",
      "PASADENA, Calif. -- Texas will be a whole lot closer to home than Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl.",
      "The Buckeyes appear to be a whole lot closer to Atlanta.",
      "That's where the winner of the Cotton Bowl, which doubles as a College Football Playoff semifinal this year, will be heading next for the national championship game.",
      "But first, two powerhouse college football programs meet Jan. 10 at the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium.",
      "No. 6 Ohio State (12-2, CFP No. 8 seed) was favored by nearly a touchdown in many early Cotton Bowl betting lines, reflecting the confidence generated by the Buckeyes' optimization of their bountiful talent over their last two games. Ohio State has looked like the best team in the nation since the first 12-team CFP began last month.",
      "Coach Ryan Day's team has rebounded from two regular-season losses to rout a pair of elite opponents by a combined 45 points. Ohio State beat No. 7 Tennessee 42-17 in Columbus before jumping to an early 34-point lead in a 41-21 thrashing of top-ranked Oregon in the 111th Rose Bowl on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s kind of an intangible thing that you can\u2019t describe (in) the chemistry that we have on this team,\u201d Ohio State receiver Emeka Egbuka said. \u201cAnd we just really don\u2019t want it to end. These are some of my best friends in the world. Obviously, no matter what we do, no matter if we keep winning, it\u2019s going to come to an end soon. So we\u2019re just taking in all the moments and just trying to push for one more game to spend with each other.\u201d",
      "Beating the previously unbeaten Ducks in handy fashion underscored the immensity of the Buckeyes' talent \u2014 and it made a strong argument in favor of the 12-team playoff, since a team with Ohio State's two losses easily could have been left out of previous playoff formats with smaller fields.",
      "No. 4 Texas (13-2, CFP No. 5 seed) only has to travel 200 miles north from Austin to Arlington for its second straight trip to the CFP semifinals, needing one win to reach the Longhorns' first CFP championship game.",
      "The Longhorns have been much less convincing than the Buckeyes in their first two CFP victories, but the Texas train somehow keeps rolling in coach Steve Sarkisian's fourth season.",
      "Georgia is the only team this season to beat the Longhorns, who have rebounded from their overtime SEC title game loss to the Bulldogs by knocking off Clemson 38-24 and then outlasting Arizona State 39-31 in double overtime to win a wild Peach Bowl.",
      "Texas barely survived the Sun Devils after blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter, missing two late field goals and then throwing a clutch TD pass on fourth and 13 in overtime to keep the game alive.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that I know about our group is when our backs are against the wall and when our best is needed, our best shows up time and time again,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cThe resiliency that these guys showed (in the Peach Bowl) was something as a coach makes you really proud.\u201d",
      "Texas fans will get to see sensational Buckeyes freshman receiver Jeremiah Smith, who had two long touchdown catches in a superb Rose Bowl. Meanwhile, Ohio State fans will get another look at quarterback Quinn Ewers, the Texas native who has played for both schools.",
      "Ewers was a top prospect in the 2022 recruiting class who committed to Texas in August 2020, but flipped to Ohio State three months later as one of the highest-rated prospects ever to sign with the school. He graduated from high school a year early and took two snaps for the Buckeyes as a third-string freshman backup to C.J. Stroud in 2021.",
      "He left Columbus after one season and transferred to Texas, where he is in his third season as the Longhorns' prolific starter.",
      "Ohio State quarterback Will Howard also has a history with Texas \u2014 both the state and the school.",
      "He threw three TD passes while leading Kansas State to the Big 12 championship at AT&T Stadium two years ago, shocking previously undefeated TCU in overtime in the league title game.",
      "Ewers and the Longhorns won the Big 12 title in the same stadium a year later, beating Oklahoma State.",
      "Howard also played for K-State against the Longhorns in three losses, including a 33-30 overtime thriller 14 months ago.",
      "Ohio State itself even has fond history at the palatial home of the NFL's Cowboys. Urban Meyer's Buckeyes beat Oregon 42-20 on this field on Jan. 12, 2015, to win the first CFP championship game in the four-team playoff era.",
      "Texas hasn\u2019t played in the Cotton Bowl in 22 years, but it will be making its record 23rd appearance in the bowl game, 10 more than second-place Texas A&M.",
      "Ohio State will be in the 88-year-old bowl for the fourth time. The Buckeyes also played in the Cotton Bowl last year, losing 14-3 to Missouri in an anticlimactic finish to a season ruined in their previous game \u2014 a loss to archrival Michigan, the eventual national champions.",
      "This Cotton Bowl is just the fourth-ever meeting between these two titans of the sport \u2014 and coincidentally, it\u2019s even a preview of next year\u2019s season opener when Texas visits Ohio Stadium on Aug. 30.",
      "Texas and Ohio State played a home-and-home series in 2005 and 2006, with both teams winning on the road. Vince Young's No. 2 Longhorns beat the fourth-ranked Buckeyes 25-22 in September 2005 for the first landmark win on their road to the national championship, while the Buckeyes answered with a 24-7 win one year later in Austin.",
      "The schools then met in a thrilling Fiesta Bowl to close the 2008-09 season. Colt McCoy threw a 26-yard TD pass to Quan Cosby with 16 seconds left in Texas' 24-21 win.",

    "summary": "Imagine having 5 gallons of mayonnaise dumped over your head",
    "story": [
      "Imagine having 5 gallons of mayonnaise dumped over your head",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Imagine having 5 gallons of mayonnaise dumped over your head.",
      "Well, that\u2019s exactly what the winning head coach of the annual Duke\u2019s Mayo Bowl receives as a \u201creward\u201d for winning the game at Bank of America Stadium, a tradition born in 2021 as Duke\u2019s Mayo looked to carve out its unique niche in the college football bowl world.",
      "Each year, the mayo dump trends on social media \u2014 and college football fans just can\u2019t seem to look away, no matter how disgusting the idea is to some observers.",
      "\u201cI think with my bald head the mayo should just slide right off,\" joked Minnesota head coach P.J. Fleck, whose team will play Virginia Tech on Friday night in the bowl game. \"I might have to do a little pre-dumping of the mayo just to make sure it does slide off. I have my own strategy just in case, but I can't let me secret out.\"",
      "There's plenty of preparation that goes into the annual mayo dump.",
      "Staff members begin by pouring five 1-gallon containers of mayonnaise into a large Gatorade-sized cooler around the start of the fourth quarter. Then, they take turns briskly stirring the mayo for more than 25 minutes with a large wooden stick.",
      "\u201cThat changes the consistency just a little bit so it's more pourable,\u201d said Duke\u2019s Mayo brand director Rebecca Lupesco. \u201dSome people think we add water. There's no water added, it's just straight mayonnaise. We just stir it up. It can be a workout.\"",
      "As tradition has it, the winning coach is seated on a chair on the field after the game and two workers will raise the cooler and pour the mayo over his head.",
      "It's a process that needed to be refined over time.",
      "In 2021, one of the handles on the cooler shifted, causing South Carolina head coach Shane Beamer to get bopped over the head with the bucket after being doused in mayo. That issue has since been addressed and the handles have been fortified to make them immovable.",
      "\u201cSince that incident we now pick our mayo dumpers very carefully,\u201d Lupesco said with a smile. \u201cLast year we did a mayo combine where 10 people were selected to come in and compete. They had to do deadlifts with buckets of mayonnaise and catch footballs with mayo on their hands. We had to make sure these people were strong enough.\"",
      "This year's mayo dumpers remain a surprise.",
      "But they will be adequately trained first, Lupesco said. She said the two pourers will practice by dumping multiple buckets of mayo over a \u201cdummy coach\" earlier in the day, with an emphasis on making sure they lift the cooler high enough above the coach's head so no one gets hit in the head.",
      "Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry said he's not a big fan of mayonnaise, but would gladly accept the bath if it means a Hokies win.",
      "\u201cIt will be like, \u2018c\u2019mon and give it to me! I want that sucker!,'\u201d Pry said. \u201cThe players and my family have had a lot of fun watching other coaches get dumped on. So I hope we are that fortunate.\u201d",
      "Former West Virginia coach Neal Brown was last year's recipient of the mayo dump after his Mountaineers' 30-10 blowout win over North Carolina \u2014 a moment he'll almost certainly never forget.",
      "\u201cI feel cold, I feel wet. ... but I feel like a winner,\u201d Brown said while covered in mayonnaise.",

      "Valerio Ferme, who took over as university president to start the year, announced Moccia's dismissal Thursday and that Amber Burdge, NMSU\u2019s deputy athletic director for strategic initiatives and leadership, would be acting athletic director.",
      "\u201cAfter carefully reviewing the recent report issued by the New Mexico Department of Justice, I felt we needed a fresh start in our athletics program,\u201d Ferme said. \u201cI have utter confidence in Dr. Burdge\u2019s ability to lead our Athletic Department, and look forward to working with her in the coming months.\u201d",
      "Ferme said Burdge played a key role in NMSU\u2019s strategic response to hazing prevention as the school's senior female administrator and deputy Title IX coordinator.",
      "Two former basketball players have agreed to plea deals in the assault cases brought against them while a third is due for trial next month.",
      "The assault allegations forced New Mexico State to shut down its 2022-23 season. In 2023, the school paid out $8 million to settle a lawsuit brought by two of the victims, former players Deuce Benjamin and Shak Odunewu, who went public with the stories of their abuse.",
      "But also in 2023, New Mexico State gave Moccia a five-year contract extension and a $72,000 raise to $351,000 a year in the first year of the new deal, which was scheduled to end in 2028.",
      "That deal was signed by chancellor Dan Arvizu on the same day he stepped down from his post \u2014 timing the school said was a coincidence.",
      "The state Department of Justice review of the sexual assaults found that they \u201cdid not occur in a vacuum but were reflective of a more pervasive toxic culture throughout the program.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere were ample opportunities for those around the team to observe this toxic culture as it was developing, but they failed to effectively intervene and prevent it,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis inaction was compounded by inadequate institutional preventative safeguards.\u201d",
      "Among the report's criticisms of Moccia were that he did not do enough upon learning about the assaults, leaning on his belief that once staff reported the case to the school's Office of Institutional Equity, it had satisfied its responsibility.",
      "\u201cAs an initial matter, it is worth noting that this belief conflicts with actual practice; Director Moccia met with and observed pertinent videos by (two of the accused players) after the OIE had received Deuce Benjamin\u2019s report in February 2022,\u201d the report said.",
      "The report also noted the school's lack of transparency in using booster funds instead of state funds to pay Moccia under his new contract.",
      "\u201cWhile the use of AAC funds for Moccia\u2019s compensation was publicly reported in mid-2023, reliance on media outlets to inform donors of potential uses of their donations is inadequate,\u201d the report said.",

      "\u201cI promise to come back even better,\u201d Ivey wrote in a post. \u201cThe recovery starts now #DetroitBasketball.\u201d",
      "The Pistons had not provided an update on Ivey's condition as of Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Detroit drafted Ivey with the No. 5 overall pick in 2022 and the former Purdue star was having a breakout year. Ivey averaged 17.6 points and 4.1 rebounds \u2014 both career highs \u2014 along with four assists in 30 games this season.",
      "He was injured when Orlando\u2019s Cole Anthony slipped and fell as he and Ivey went for the ball. Anthony\u2019s momentum carried him into Ivey\u2019s planted leg, knocking Ivey to the floor. The 22-year-old Ivey was in obvious distress as he grabbed for his shin, and the team's medical staff quickly attended to him.",
      "Members of the training staff held up towels to block the crowd\u2019s view of the injury and players from both teams formed a circle around him. After a lengthy delay, he was loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled out of the arena with a towel covering the injury.",
      "\u201cIt is tough for all of us,\u201d Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said after Detroit\u2019s 105-96 victory. \u201cThere\u2019s no better person or teammate than J.I. and no one cares more about this than he does.\"",

      "Flags are at half-staff outside the Superdome and at nearby state buildings as fans arrive a day later than scheduled for a College Football Playoff quarterfinal game between Notre Dame and Georgia at the Sugar Bowl",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Flags were at half-staff outside the Superdome and at nearby state buildings on Thursday as fans arrived a day later than scheduled for the Sugar Bowl \u2014 a game serving this season as a College Football Playoff quarterfinal between Notre Dame and Georgia.",
      "Security was ramped up around the stadium a little more than a day after an attack early Wednesday in the nearby French Quarter, where authorities say a truck driver deliberately plowed into a New Year\u2019s crowd \u2014 killing 14 people and injuring more than 30.",
      "The attack occurred on Bourbon Street, which runs through the heart of the French Quarter and is famously lined with bars, restaurants and clubs, near the corner of Canal Street, a main downtown artery.",
      "The crime scene, which was gradually being cleared so it could be reopened to the public on Thursday afternoon, is about a mile's walk from the Superdome.",
      "Numerous security officers around the 70,000-seat stadium were handling dogs trained to sniff for explosive devices. They encircled cars entering the Superdome parking garage and in some cases sniffed bags and backpacks.",
      "The game, originally scheduled for 7:45 p.m. CST on Wednesday, was pushed back to 3 p.m. Thursday, with the winner advancing to the Jan. 9 Orange Bowl against Fiesta Bowl winner Penn State.",
      "While many traveling fans extended their stay to attend the game, the postponement meant some would not be able to attend because of travel plans that were deemed too expensive or logistically difficult to change.",
      "Numerous tickets were listed for resale online at prices of $30 or less, some as low as $23.",
      "Postponing the game \u201cwas absolutely the right call,\u201d said Lisa Borrelli, a 34-year-old Philadelphia resident who came to New Orleans with her fianc\u00e9, a 2011 Notre Dame graduate, but could not stay for the game.",

      "\u201cOf course we\u2019re disappointed to miss it and to lose so much money on it, but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Borrelli said. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate enough that we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-La., said the decision to postpone the game \u201cwas not done lightly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was done with one single thing in mind: public safety,\" he said.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he would attend the game, adding, \u201cThat is proof, believe you me, that that facility and this city is safer today than it was yesterday. \u201d",
      "Darrell Huckaby, 72, of Athens, Georgia, also decided to return home Thursday instead of staying for the game. He was in a hotel room overlooking where the attack took place. He was asleep when it occurred, but when he woke up, he could see pink blankets covering bodies of the dead.",
      "\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the first instinct of most people this morning was wanting to be home. As important as football is to our Georgia culture, for a little while, the game just didn\u2019t really seem to matter.",
      "He added that he would \u201cprobably eat\u201d the $360 per ticket he paid.",
      "Sugar Bowl Chief Executive Officer Jeff Hundley had pledged on Wednesday afternoon to \u201cset up a safe and efficient and fun environment\u201d at and around the Superdome on Thursday.",

      "Liverpool vs",
      "MANCHESTER, England -- Liverpool vs. Manchester United used to be English soccer's fiercest rivalry. Sunday's showdown at Anfield pits two teams going in opposite directions.",
      "Liverpool, top of the Premier League and the Champions League, has its sights on equalling United 's record 20 Premier League titles and more. Liverpool has lost to United just once in seven years in the Premier League, and most recently won 3-0 at Old Trafford in September.",
      "United is closer to the relegation zone than the top in another calamitous campaign which has seen the departure of a manager, a sporting director and the exile of one of its leading players.",
      "The gap between Liverpool and United is widening to the point where one is in contention for a quadruple of trophies and the other is talking about top flight survival.",
      "How have English soccer\u2019s two most successful teams ended up on such differing paths?",
      "United has been in alarming decline since winning a record 20th title in Alex Ferguson's final season as manager in 2013. It hasn't come close to winning another since his retirement. Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent manager hired in the last 11-plus years.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag all failed to deliver consistent success and the upheaval from so much managerial change has repeatedly set back United as the club has lurched from one direction to another.",
      "Amorim has quickly realized the size of the job after six defeats in his last eight games. This week he admitted he could be in a relegation fight.",
      "\u201cIt is a possibility,\" he said. \"We have to be clear with our fans.\u201d",
      "While United has made a mess of trying to replace a managerial great, Liverpool has made it look easy.",
      "Arne Slot took on the unenviable task of filling the void left by J\u00fcrgen Klopp at the end of last season and has driven the team to new levels.",
      "Klopp won a full set of trophies at Anfield and was denied much more success in the Premier League than just the 2020 title only by Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.",
      "Slot has Liverpool leading the Premier League by six points with a game in hand, the Champions League by three points, and through to the semifinals of the English League Cup.",
      "Perhaps he has been fortunate to take over when City has gone into freefall but Liverpool's 14 wins from 18 games in the league would be title-challenging form in any season.",
      "Billions have been spent at United yet there have been more costly errors than transfer successes.",
      "Superstar signings such as Angel di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Paul Pogba, Casemiro and Jadon Sancho have proved to be big disappointments. From the last transfer window, signees such as Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt have struggled.",
      "Amorim is likely to have to sell in January if he wants to bring more players in and Marcus Rashford, recently dropped from the team, could be his best chance of raising funds.",
      "Conversely, Liverpool has been one of the savviest operators in the transfer market over the past decade. When it has spent big, it has generally spent well, with the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson proving pillars of its trophy haul. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were relative bargains.",
      "Under Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the American conglomerate that also owns the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool became a major force in England and Europe again and ended a 30-year title drought in the Premier League.",
      "The hiring of Klopp was pivotal to that but so was Michael Edwards, the sporting director who was integral to so many transfer successes. He left in 2022 but is back as FSG chief executive of football and helped to guide the transition to Slot.",
      "United's American owner, the Glazer family, has faced regular fan protests since its leveraged buyout of the club in 2005.",
      "The minority investment by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe last year sparked optimism. He assumed control of the club's soccer operations but that hasn't gone to plan so far.",
      "Ten Hag was fired months after signing a contract extension and sporting director Dan Ashworth departed after less than six months. The signings in Ratcliffe's first summer transfer window also look questionable with United 14th in the standings and just seven points above the relegation zone.",
      "Liverpool is enjoying an outstanding campaign with big issues to be resolved.",
      "Salah, Van Dijk and Trent Alexander Arnold are out of contract after this season. Salah and Van Dijk are in their 30s and in dispute is the length of contract Liverpool is prepared to offer them. Alexander Arnold, meanwhile, is reportedly a target for Real Madrid.",
      "Amorim's immediate concern is how to turn around United's form. Long term, his squad looks ill-suited to his preferred system.",

      "She won a total of 10 Olympic medals in gymnastics, including five golds, for Hungary at the 1952 Helsinki Games and the 1956 Melbourne Games. She overcame the loss of her father and several relatives in the Holocaust to become one of the most successful Jewish Olympic athletes.",

      "Her mother and sister survived the war with the help of famed Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, but her father and other relatives perished at Auschwitz, among the more than half a million Hungarian Jews killed in Nazi death camps and by Hungarian Nazi collaborators.",

      "One is at The Sentry, the season opener on the PGA Tour that starts Thursday on hilly terrain in Maui with endless views of the Pacific Ocean. Schauffele knows what to expect at Kapalua having won the tournament six years ago with a 62 in the final round.",
      "The other starts next Tuesday inside a 250,000-square-foot building on the campus of Palm Beach State College, a technological wonder when it comes to golf and a game that will only look familiar because of the players involved.",
      "This one makes Schauffele curiously excited.",
      "It's the debut of the TMRW Golf League, a six-team league featuring Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy among 24 players \u2014 13 of them major champions \u2014 in fast-paced, two-hour matches to be televised in prime time on ESPN platforms.",

Architects have pitched in to design 30 holes that will be used at given times during the competition. For shots 50 yards or closer, players hit actual shots into the green.",

But I think there are certain things that we can do to innovate and try to appeal to a different and younger demographic, especially trying to condense it into a time frame that is a little bit more digestible and putting it on at a time where we\u2019re maybe going to get a few more eyeballs.\u201d",

Electronic boards on both sides of the screen show the score, shot clock and yardages.",

      "Players will wear microphones. They will be presented with yardage and wind conditions before each shot. Winning a hole is worth one point (no carryovers for a halve).",
      "The six teams are Atlanta Drive, New York, Los Angeles, The Bay (San Francisco), Boston Common and Jupiter Links.",
      "Team ownership has power brokers that include Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank (Atlanta Drive), Fenway Sports Group (Boston), Stephen Curry and former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry (Bay) and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen (New York). Serena and Venus Williams are part owners of Los Angeles.",
      "It's night golf, sandwiched between college basketball on Monday and Tuesday nights. It's team golf. And it's indoor golf, the most unusual aspect of all.",
      "\u201cIt's a brand new concept, a brand new presentation of golf. There's something exciting about seeing what that's going to be like and being on the ground floor,\u201d said Patrick Cantlay, part of the Atlanta Drive team.",
      "\u201cIt gives a chance for a different perspective on people watching PGA Tour players,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be more personable, more action-packed. And I think the stadium they built is extremely impressive \u2014 impressive in person, and an impressive feat of engineering.\u201d",

      "Well-traveled guard Buddy Hield has found a good fit in the Bay Area with the Golden State Warriors shooting alongside Stephen Curry",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Buddy Hield hollers through the locker room at Stephen Curry with some good-natured banter or cracks jokes at practice and on the team plane, by all accounts leaving everyone in hysterics.",
      "From the moment Hield joined the Golden State Warriors last summer, he exhibited a tireless training regimen, too \u2014 one that has impressed Curry.",
      "\u201cHe probably puts more hours in the gym than I think I\u2019ve ever seen anybody,\u201d Curry said.",
      "The two-time NBA MVP is enjoying the high-energy personality, team-first dedication along with his new Warriors backcourt mate's love for his craft.",
      "From Freeport in the Bahamas to the Bay Area, the 32-year-old Hield takes great pride in representing his island nation on the big NBA stage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d Hield said. \u201cIt\u2019s not by chance. I\u2019ve put the work in, for sure. I\u2019m just blessed and honored to be in this position.\u201d",
      "Hield is averaging 12.6 points and shooting nearly 43% from the field with the Warriors, but he also is making his presence felt off the court.",
      "When Hield arrives anywhere with the Warriors, he offers his hellos with that signature smile and instantly lifts the spirits of his new team. It's the kind of joy and focus coach Steve Kerr has long insisted defines the Warriors franchise.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing even-keel about him, he is all extreme happy, joy, talking all the time, and you love that energy because he loves the game,\u201d Curry said. \u201c... He does bring joy to the locker room, to the plane. No matter where we\u2019re at, you\u2019re going to hear him and he lifts everybody up because he\u2019s got a great sense of humor and he\u2019s been around the block. The funniest part is you just can\u2019t get him to shut up. So you appreciate everything he brings.\u201d",
      "His teammates call him Buddy Love, Buddy Fresh and Buddy Buckets \u2014 the nickname Buddy has been with the shooting guard since just after his birth, as Hield's formal first name is Chavano.",
      "Hield became the 17th player in NBA history to reach 2,000 3-pointers, and he sparks the offense with the way he runs the floor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just got to keep moving and hopefully I\u2019m able to catch some of the greats,\" Hield said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be able to catch Steph, but I hope to catch some of the greats and hopefully I can crack top-10, maybe top-five.\u201d",
      "That would be just fine with Kerr.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re playing fast and with a lot of pace, and that\u2019s what Buddy does really well,\" Kerr said. \u201cHe runs the floor in transition probably better than anybody on our team.\u201d",
      "The Warriors (16-16) have been struggling lately, losing three of their last 10.",
      "But you won't hear complaints from Hield, who has enjoyed an impressive run \u2014 from shooting as a youngster on a makeshift hoop that he and his brother Chevez constructed from a milk crate to helping lead Oklahoma to a Final Four in college and now as a journeyman in his ninth NBA season with a fifth different team.",
      "\"Where I came from in the Bahamas, I couldn\u2019t write a better script than this, just being down there, shooting on an outside court, building my own court right from a crate. To have 2,000 3s, I know the young kids back home and the people that helped me get to this point will really appreciate that.",
      "\"So I\u2019m just blessed to be in this situation.\u201d",
      "Hield landed with Golden State following Klay Thompson\u2019s departure to Dallas, and it's something Bahamas teammate Thompson called \u201cvery special.\u201d",
      "\"I\u2019m just happy they replaced me with another Bahamian,\u201d he said.",
      "And Thompson certainly realizes what Hield means to the Bahamas and helping build basketball back home.",
      "\u201cAre you kidding me? He\u2019s a legend, especially around Freeport. Buddy gives young men and women hope all over the nation,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cEspecially his commitment to the national team, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s really cool.\u201d",
      "Hield's shooting has been inconsistent, but the Warriors are seeing everything he brings on and off the court. And that doesn't waver whether he's hitting shots or missing them, or starting or coming off the bench.",
      "\"He lifts this team every day when he comes in smiling,\u201d guard Gary Payton II said. \u201cI know that smile travels all the way back to the Bahamas and those kids have the same smile when he\u2019s on the court. ... How he plays and what he does, it\u2019s kind of like a Steph effect over there in the islands. They\u2019re shouting Buddy. We know what he means to this team and what he means to the Bahamas.\u201d",

      "No. 6 Ohio State roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 41-21 victory over No. 1 Oregon in the 111th Rose Bowl",
      "PASADENA, Calif. -- Jeremiah Smith caught two of Will Howard\u2019s three long touchdown passes during Ohio State\u2019s sensational 34-point first half, and the No. 6 Buckeyes roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 41-21 victory over No. 1 Oregon in the 111th Rose Bowl Game on Wednesday night.",
      "Howard passed for 319 yards, Emeka Egbuka also caught a long TD pass and TreVeyon Henderson made a 66-yard touchdown run in a redemptive Rose Bowl for the Buckeyes (12-2, CFP No. 8 seed), whose big-game execution sometimes hasn't matched their formidable talent this season.",
      "Ohio State has seized the second chances created by the first 12-team CFP, emphatically blowing out the tournament's No. 1 seed. The Buckeyes scored on six of their first seven drives and took a 34-0 lead late in the second quarter on the nation\u2019s only remaining unbeaten team in the Granddaddy of Them All.",
      "Ohio State is headed to the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 10 to face No. 4 Texas for a berth in the national title game. The Longhorns barely advanced earlier Wednesday, holding off Arizona State 39-31 in a double-overtime Peach Bowl.",
      "Dillon Gabriel passed for 299 yards and hit Traeshon Holden for two touchdowns for the Ducks (13-1, CFP No. 1 seed), whose dreams of their first national title were flattened on the famed Rose Bowl turf. Oregon's 14-game winning streak also ended.",
      "Eleven days after routing Tennessee to open the Playoff, Ohio State dominated this rematch of these Big Ten teams\u2019 regular-season thriller, won 32-31 by the Ducks in Eugene on Oct. 12. The Ohio State defense that couldn\u2019t sack Gabriel in the teams\u2019 first meeting dropped the Heisman Trophy finalist eight times in the rematch.",
      "Smith, the Buckeyes' standout freshman playmaker, had a remarkable bowl debut with seven receptions for 187 yards \u2014 including five catches for 161 yards in the first half alone, hauling in scoring passes of 45 and 43 yards.",
      "Ohio State turned the CFP\u2019s most anticipated quarterfinal matchup into a long celebration at the Rose Bowl, which has hosted several thrilling, close games in recent Januaries. This one pitted two powerhouse programs widely considered to have the top two teams left in the inaugural 12-team Playoff, but the Buckeyes scored early and often at the Rose Bowl.",
      "The Big Ten champion Ducks couldn\u2019t make any offensive headway until they trailed by 34 points, failing to create any of the big plays that carried the Ducks to victory in Eugene.",
      "After the usual pregame pageantry in 70-degree sunshine at the venerable stadium in Arroyo Seco, Ohio State needed just three plays and 49 seconds to strike first. Howard threw a short play-action screen pass to Smith, who motored through Oregon\u2019s secondary for a 45-yard score.",
      "On the Buckeyes\u2019 third drive, Howard feathered an exceptional long pass over three Ducks to the sprinting Egbuka for a 42-yard TD. Howard finished the first quarter with a career-best 212 yards passing, surpassing his 160 yards during Ohio State\u2019s hot start against Tennessee.",
      "Early in the second quarter, Smith got so open near the Ducks\u2019 goal line that he had two seconds to settle under Howard\u2019s long throw like an outfielder with a fly ball, scoring a 42-yard TD untouched.",
      "When Henderson broke a 66-yard TD run down the Oregon sideline for a 31-0 lead, both sides of the Rose Bowl stands rippled with disbelief.",
      "Oregon finally got moving on its final drive before halftime. Gabriel found Holden for a 5-yard TD pass at the gun, and the Ducks added a two-point conversion to salvage something from their horrific half.",
      "The Ducks drove for Noah Whittington\u2019s 2-yard TD run to open the second half, scoring the first touchdown allowed in the third quarter all season by Ohio State. Oregon even forced a punt moments later to stir faint hope in its fans, but the Ohio State defense drove the Buckeyes backward for a punt before Howard\u2019s group methodically drove for Henderson\u2019s second TD.",
      "Ohio State: The full force of the Buckeyes' talent has been on display for the past two weeks after it fell short against Oregon and Michigan in the regular season. The 12-team playoff opened the chance for redemption. This group is seizing it, and it's awfully fun to watch.",
      "Oregon: Having 3 1/2 weeks off with their first-round bye proved to be dangerous for the Ducks. This disconcerting flop doesn't completely ruin a breakthrough Big Ten debut, but the season will always loom as a missed opportunity in Oregon history.",
      "Ohio State: The Cotton Bowl will be a preview of both teams\u2019 2025 season opener, since Texas visits Ohio Stadium on Aug. 30.",
      "Oregon: The 2025 season opener is at home against Montana State, which faces North Dakota State in the FCS title game Monday night.",

      "HOUSTON -- Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair said he was in a \u201creally dark place\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d ever play football again in the days after he was suspended for three games for his hit on Jacksonville\u2019s Trevor Lawrence that left the quarterback with a concussion.",
      "Speaking to reporters Wednesday for the first time since the suspension, Al-Shaair discussed his state of mind during his absence.",
      "\u201cThe things that you can think when somebody says they\u2019re in a dark place, as dark as you can go is where I was truthfully,\u201d he said.",
      "Al-Shaair added that \u201cit was hard for me to see myself playing football again\u201d before he met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and league executives Troy Vincent and Jon Runyan.",
      "Lawrence clenched both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair in what escalated into a brawl.",
      "As Al-Shaair was leaving the field after being ejected, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet.",
      "Al-Shaair said that he understood the suspension, but disagreed with how he was characterized by Runyan in the letter informing him of the punishment. It included Runyan telling Al-Shaair: \u201cYour lack of sportsmanship and respect for the game of football and all those who play, coach, and enjoy watching it, is troubling and does not reflect the core values of the NFL.\u201d",
      "He said he needed to talk to Runyan and other NFL executives to understand how they viewed him as a player before he could return to the field.",
      "\u201cI really had a moment of, there\u2019s no way I can go out and play football again if this is how people that I work with view me,\u201d Al-Shaair said.",
      "He said Runyan told him that he was watching the play and the ensuing melee when he wrote the letter and that he was only referring to those moments and not his entire career in his comments about his sportsmanship.",
      "\u201cBut the way he typed it, he said got obviously taken out of context,\u201d Al-Shaair said. \u201cI clearly made a mistake (and) the reason why he typed something which ended up being taken out of context as a mistake is because I did something that was obviously not right, me taking my helmet off and me starting another brawl ... wasn\u2019t right.",
      "\u201cBut everything prior to that I stand on the fact that I never tried to hurt him,\u201d he continued.",
      "Al-Shaair said he sat in a room not doing anything for about five days after his suspension.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a blur,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat nothing. I didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d",
      "By Friday of that week, some children at a foster care organization in Tennessee that he had met last year when he played for the Titans sent him messages of encouragement.",
      "\u201cI got so many different messages like that and I remember just sitting in my bed and I was like: \u2018Man, like I can just keep sitting here sad and sulking and just feeling like I\u2019m being misjudged or I can just do what I always do, which is just try to be positive and spread positivity, do the best that I can,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He booked a plane ticket to Nashville and got there in time to attend the same event at the foster care organization that he\u2019d attended the previous year.",
      "\u201cI had so many people saying so many negative things and to see people that were happy to see me and were happy about my presence I think that\u2019s what kind of like snapped me back,\u201d Al-Shaair said. \u201cLike regardless of what\u2019s being said, you know who you are and just lean into that and ... from there just crawling myself out of this place.\u201d",
      "When the AFC South champion Texans (9-7) face the Titans on Sunday, he'll return for the first time since the hit on Lawrence, and coach DeMeco Ryans is thrilled to have him back. The Texans have been hit hard by injuries and are limping into the playoffs after two straight losses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve missed him over these past three weeks, just missed his presence, his leadership, missed his playmaking ability on the field,\u201d Ryans said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re excited to get him back out there and let him knock some of the rust off.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- The Peach Bowl referee declined to call a targeting penalty late in the fourth quarter for a helmet-to-helmet hit by Texas safety Michael Taaffe that could've given Arizona State a chance to kick a winning field goal in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals Wednesday.",
      "The fourth-ranked Longhorns went on to beat the No. 10 Sun Devils 39-31 in double overtime after Texas squandered a 16-point lead in the final period of regulation.",
      "The big hit by Taaffe came after Texas missed a field goal attempt with 1:39 remaining that left the game tied at 24-all. Taking over, Arizona State faced third-and-15 from its own 38 when Sam Leavitt delivered a short pass over the middle to Melquan Stovall.",
      "Taaffe arrived about the time Stovall made the 10-yard reception, their helmets clearly hitting, and the Arizona State receiver was left sprawled on the turf.",
      "No flag was thrown, but referee Larry Smith of the Big Ten conference halted play to check the replay for possible targeting. As Stovall was being helped off the field, Smith announced there was no penalty, leaving Arizona State with fourth-and-5 at its own 48.",
      "If targeting had been called, a 15-yard penalty would have given the Sun Devils a first down at the Texas 37. Instead, they punted the ball away.",
      "Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham argued with the officials on the sideline. It was clear he didn't agree with the call after one of his own players, star defensive back Shamari Simmons, had to sit out the first half after being ejected from the Big 12 championship game for a targeting penalty.",
      "Texas took advantage of Simmons' replacement, Montana Warren, to hit two long passes for a touchdown on its opening possession.",
      "\u201cI'm going to be honest, I don't know what targeting is,\u201d Dillingham said. \u201cWe lost one of our best players in the first half for targeting, and I just don't know what it is.\u201d",
      "Targeting generally refers to a player delivering a hit while leading with the crown of his helmet. While Taaffe's helmet undoubtedly hit Stovall's, it didn't appear the Texas player lowered his head.",
      "Dillingham said he's baffled by the targeting rule.",
      "\u201cI don't want to comment on something that I have to get a better grasp on what it is,\" the coach said. \u201cI just don't quite understand it. I do want to protect the players, though. So whatever rules are put in place to protect the players, I'm all about it.\u201d",

      "If the Denver Broncos are embracing the opportunity to face Carson Wentz instead of Patrick Mahomes on Sunday, they're not saying so publicly",
      "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- The Denver Broncos aren't necessarily breathing any easier knowing they won't have to face Patrick Mahomes and several other Kansas City Chiefs starters on Sunday with a playoff berth on the line.",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid announced his decision to rest Mahomes on Wednesday, but declined to say who else might spend the day with the three-time Super Bowl MVP on the sideline in Denver with Kansas City having already secured the AFC's top seed.",
      "There's a good chance, though, that superstar defensive tackle Chris Jones (strained calf) will sit this one out. And the same could go for running back Isiah Pacheco (bruised ribs), right tackle Jawaan Taylor (sore knee) and veteran tight end Travis Kelce, who similarly skipped last year\u2019s Week 18 game, among others.",
      "\u201cWe have to play the game to win, that's all that matters,\u201d Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton said. \u201cWe don't care about none of the other stuff. Whoever has on shoulder pads and is wearing red, white and yellow, we have to beat them boys.",
      "\u201cWe don't care who shows up and plays,\u201d Sutton continued. \u201cWe don't care who sits. We don't care who doesn't play, who does play. We don't care about any of that. The Denver Broncos have to show up Sunday and win the game.\u201d",
      "If they do, the Broncos (9-7) will clinch a playoff berth for the first time since winning Super Bowl 50 in Peyton Manning's final game on Feb. 7. 2016.",
      "The franchise has churned through half a dozen coaches and more than a dozen starting quarterbacks since hoisting the team's third Lombardi Trophy nearly nine years ago.",
      "The Chiefs (15-1) won three games in an 11-day stretch culminating with a 29-10 win at Pittsburgh on Christmas Day that secured the conference's first-round bye as they seek a three-peat as Super Bowl champions. Reid is using the finale as a chance to rest some of his starters, who will have more than a three-week break by the time they return to the field for an AFC divisional-round game on either Jan. 18 or 19.",
      "\u201cYou know, a credit to Kansas City, Andy and his team,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201cWhen you go 15-1, then you're afforded those decisions and I've been in that position where your team might need a break here or there. They've earned that and that's part of the deal. For us, it's about understanding what we're seeing scheme-wise and being ready to play our best game.\u201d",
      "The Broncos blew chances to wrap up a playoff berth with road losses to the Los Angeles Chargers and Cincinnati Bengals the last two weeks. But they're embracing the moment as they control their own destiny with a win-and-in game at home Sunday.",
      "\u201cYou could say that it would have been nice to be able to go into this game and have your position locked in,\u201d Sutton said, \u201cbut in terms of a storybook thing that you couldn't really write up any better, I think this is the best opportunity that we could have to go in and solidify why we deserve to be in the dance.\u201d",
      "The Broncos could back into the playoffs even if they lose to the Chiefs or tie them Sunday if Cincinnati loses to Pittsburgh on Saturday and the Miami Dolphins lose to the New York Jets on Sunday.",
      "They're not relying on anybody else punching their playoff ticket, though.",
      "\u201cWe gotta win the game, simple,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThere's nothing that goes into it. We gotta win the game. People say it's never black and white \u2014 it's black and white. We gotta win the game. And that's as simple as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Broncos snapped a 16-game losing streak to the Chiefs with a 24-9 win in Denver last season, and they were on the verge of beating Kansas City in Week 10 at Arrowhead Stadium when the Chiefs blocked a 33-yard field goal as time expired to preserve a 16-14 victory.",
      "In the aftermath of that heartbreaker, the Broncos flipped Alex Forsyth and Matt Peart on the left side of their field goal protection unit. Kicker Wil Lutz has gone 12 of 12 on field goals and 22 of 22 on extra points since then.",

      "Texas avoided the first big upset of the College Football Playoff, hitting a fourth-and-long touchdown pass to keep the game going and beating Arizona State 39-31 in double overtime when an interception by Andrew Mukuba finally ended a Peach Bowl quart...",
      "ATLANTA -- Texas avoided the first big upset of the College Football Playoff, hitting a fourth-and-long touchdown pass to keep the game going and beating Cam Skattebo and Arizona State 39-31 in double overtime when an interception by Andrew Mukuba finally ended a Peach Bowl quarterfinal classic Wednesday.",
      "Skattebo led the Sun Devils back from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter and put his team ahead for the first time all day with a 3-yard touchdown run to start overtime against No. 4 Texas (13-2).",
      "No. 10 Arizona State \u2014 a two-touchdown underdog according to BetMGM Sportsbook \u2014 was on the verge of winning when Texas faced fourth-and-13 on its first overtime possession. But Quinn Ewers found Matthew Golden breaking free behind two defenders to haul in a 28-yard touchdown.",
      "After moving to the opposite end of Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Ewers threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Gunnar Helms on the very next play, followed by a 2-point conversion pass to Golden.",
      "The Longhorns finally put Arizona State (11-3) away when Mukuba picked off Sam Leavitt's pass at the 3 to end the game.",
      "After a bunch of lopsided results through the first five games of the expanded 12-team playoff, the format finally produced a classic that sends Texas back home for a Cotton Bowl semifinal on Jan. 10 against No. 1 Oregon or No. 6 Ohio State, who were facing off in the Rose Bowl on Wednesday.",
      "Despite being dominated on the stat sheet most of the game, the Longhorns had a seemingly comfortable 24-8 lead after scoring two early touchdowns and getting a 5-yard scoring run from Ewers with just over 10 minutes remaining.",
      "But Skattebo and the Sun Devils were just getting warmed up.",
      "The running back who calls himself the best in the nation, Skattebo backed up his bravado with a performance for the ages, showing every facet of his all-around game.",
      "First, he took a pitch on fourth-and-2 and heaved a 42-yard touchdown pass to Malik McClain that gave the Sun Devils a chance when they made the 2-point conversion.",
      "Then, Skattebo broke loose down the sideline and hauled in a 62-yard throw from Leavitt \u2014 getting his helmet ripped off at the end of the play, which seemed like the only way to bring him down.",
      "That set up a 2-yard touchdown run by the bowling ball of a back, and it was only appropriate that Skattebo also powered in for the 2-point conversion that tied the game at 24 with 5 minutes remaining.",
      "Texas had a pair of chances to win in regulation, but Bert Auburn was wide right on a 48-yard field goal attempt and clanked one off the left upright from 38 yards away as time expired.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Jimmy Garoppolo will take his first snaps for the Rams when he starts in place of Matthew Stafford in playoff-bound Los Angeles' regular-season finale against Seattle on Sunday.",
      "Coach Sean McVay announced the decision Wednesday to rest Stafford, the 16-year veteran starter. The Rams haven't decided which additional starters will rest.",
      "Los Angeles (10-6) has clinched the NFC West title over the Seahawks (9-7) based on strength of schedule. The Rams are currently the third seed in the NFC playoff bracket, but they will fall to fourth if they lose to Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-7) beat Atlanta to win the South division.",
      "The wild-card seeding is still in flux among Minnesota, Washington and Green Bay, so McVay clearly doesn't care whether the Rams enter the postseason as the third or fourth seed.",
      "Garoppolo has yet to play for the Rams since signing to be Stafford's backup last spring. The 33-year-old veteran who led San Francisco to Super Bowl 54, missed the first two games of his first season in Los Angeles under suspension for violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancing drug policy.",
      "Stafford has taken every snap this season for the Rams, who have won nine of 11 to surge into the postseason for the third time in his four years with Los Angeles. His 3,762 yards passing and 20 touchdown passes are his fewest in a season in which he played at least 15 games, but Stafford's eight interceptions are also his fewest in a nearly-full season, while his completion rate (65.8 percent) is above his career average.",
      "Stafford improved to 13-1 as a starter in Rams games played in December when Los Angeles held off Arizona 13-9 last Saturday, but his offense has been in a slump. The Rams have scored more than 21 points just once during their current five-game winning streak, and they've managed just three touchdowns in their past three games combined.",
      "Los Angeles' third-string quarterback is Stetson Bennett. The two-time national championship winner at Georgia and fourth-round draft pick in 2023 also has yet to play for the Rams, missing all of last season while away from the team for undisclosed personal reasons.",

    "summary": "The Washington Commanders are in the playoffs in their first season with general manager Adam Peters, coach Dan Quinn and quarterback Jayden Daniels",
    "story": [
      "The Washington Commanders are in the playoffs in their first season with general manager Adam Peters, coach Dan Quinn and quarterback Jayden Daniels",
      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Moments after the Washington Commanders finished the 2023 season at 4-13 and locked up the second pick in the draft, Daron Payne was already feeling optimistic about the organization's long-term future.",
      "In fact, the standout defensive tackle was bullish about success coming much quicker.",
      "\u201cYou see it around the NFL,\u201d Payne said on Jan. 7. \"Just last year, the Houston Texans, man, they was horrible. Now, look at them. They\u2019re a playoff team. All it takes is a couple pieces. A couple pieces, a couple good players and just start a run.\u201d",
      "Steps away from his locker stall, 357 days later, new coach Dan Quinn called over new general manager Adam Peters to celebrate the Commanders completing an improbable turnaround. Peters held a game ball from Washington's 30-24 overtime victory in his hand and addressed controlling owner Josh Harris.",
      "\u201cThere's no better gift that you can give a man on his 60th birthday than a playoff berth,\u201d Peters said, handing the ball to Harris while players cheered.",
      "\u201cThank you guys for everything,\u201d Harris exclaimed. \u201cPlayoffs!\"",
      "Jan. 11, 12 or 13 at Tampa Bay, Philadelphia or the Los Angeles Rams will be just Washington's seventh playoff game this century, and it comes in Jayden Daniels' breakout rookie season after taking the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback with the No. 2 pick.",
      "\u201cThe fan base waited a long time for this,\u201d Daniels said after leading another comeback victory. \u201cI really can\u2019t put into words how much it means to them and how much it means to me to be able to go out there and lead this franchise and this team to opportunities like that.\u201d",
      "Payne maybe had a premonition. Super Bowl champion tight end Zach Ertz agreed to join the Commanders in early March long before Daniels was drafted and even before veteran QB Marcus Mariota signed as a free agent.",
      "After Harris and ownership put Peters in charge of football operations, then they collaborated to hire Quinn, Kliff Kingsbury was brought in to run the offense and Joe Whitt Jr. the defense.",
      "\u201cI knew with the staff that they were building that we were going to have a chance,\u201d Ertz said.",
      "Following Ertz to Washington were six-time All-Pro Bobby Wagner and fellow linebackers Frankie Luvu and Dante Fowler, safety Jeremy Chinn, running back Austin Ekeler, defensive end Dorance Armstrong and offensive linemen Nick Allegretti, Tyler Biadasz.",
      "\u201cWe started bringing in veterans who I played against my whole life that a lot of them have torched us our whole life: Zach Ertz, Bobby Wagner \u2014 all these guys,\u201d punter Tress Way said.",
      "With Peters turning over more than half the 90-man training camp roster, gelling was important.",
      "\u201cEverybody had to get to know each other,\u201d said Wagner, who won the Super Bowl with Seattle when Quinn was defensive coordinator there. \u201cEverybody had to kind of build that camaraderie. And I think we did that really fast. There was a lot of guys that bought into the culture, bought into the people around them, had confidence in the people around them.\u201d",
      "Spring workouts allowed for that and helped the light bulb go off for Way, the team's longest-tenured player who endured a lot of losing over his decade in the league. He gave up his number to Daniels so the new face of the franchise could wear the same No. 5 on his chest that he did at Arizona State and LSU.",
      "There were no regrets.",
      "\u201cThe first time I saw \u20185\u2019 throw the football, I just thought, \u2018Well, let\u2019s play some ball and see what happens,'\u201d Way said.",
      "Daniels was not anointed the starter when he arrived, nor at the beginning of training camp. It took a couple of preseason games before Quinn made that declaration.",
      "\u201cNothing\u2019s ever been given to anyone on this team,\u201d Ertz said. \u201cEven Jayden, they made him earn it throughout training camp, throughout the offseason. And that stuff doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by players like myself who have been in the league for 12 years.\u201d",
      "Daniels lost his NFL debut, then led the Commanders on a four-game winning streak and victories in seven of the next eight while gutting through a rib injury, including a Hail Mary touchdown throw to beat Chicago among his many spectacular moments.",
      "\u201cHis poise, him being able to stay calm in the pocket in pressure situations, you don\u2019t get that from a lot of rookie quarterbacks,\u201d receiver Jamison Crowder said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad, man, that he\u2019s on my team.\"",
      "The Commanders beat the New York Giants in Week 2 despite not scoring a touchdown thanks to seven field goals on seven tries from new kicker Austin Seibert. They beat Cincinnati on the road on Monday night, then won at Arizona and took care of business at home against Cleveland.",
      "A predictable defeat at AFC heavyweight Baltimore followed to bring them back to earth. Teammates recalled Daniels' anger after losing, and it filtered around the room.",
      "\u201cNobody gets down, but everybody gets (ticked) off,\u201d Way said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get sad. You just get mad and then you go back and do better.\u201d",
      "The rib injury sidelined Daniels early in a rout of Carolina, but he returned the following week to beat the Bears. Winning 27-22 at the Giants the following week to improve to 7-2 was the kind of \u201cugly game\u201d that showed players what they could do when Daniels didn't have the magic touch.",
      "\u201cIt was like, man, we\u2019re just finding a way to win,\u201d Way said. \u201cThere\u2019s just this belief.\"",
      "Daniels completed 60.98% of his passes in his first five games back. The Commanders lost three in a row in November to Pittsburgh, at Philadelphia and to Dallas.",
      "They have not lost since, are 11-5 and have the chance to think about making a playoff run just as surprising as this season.",
      "\u201cI love being part of this group of guys, and it feels awesome to obviously be able to go to the playoffs in our first year,\u201d Ertz said. \"But we also feel like we still have some room to grow, room to improve. ... We just can\u2019t rest on our laurels.\u201d",

      "\u201cI know this will come as a shock to many, but I am OK and I will be OK,\u201d the 32-year-old Canadian said on social media. \u201cEarly detection saves lives. I can wholeheartedly agree with this.\u201d",
      "Dabrowski, ranked third in women's doubles, said in an Instagram post that she received the diagnosis in April. She did not play that month and in May because of surgery, but returned to the courts in June.",
      "Dabrowski said there was \u201ca slight delay in further treatment\u201d so she could compete at Wimbledon \u2014 where she and New Zealand's Erin Routliffe lost the final in July to Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend \u2014 and the Paris Olympics, where she won the bronze medal in mixed doubles with Felix Auger-Aliassime.",
      "Dabrowski said she had found a first lump in the second half of 2023 and was initially told not to worry about it.",
      "\u201cIt all seems surreal,\u201d Dabrowski wrote, saying she now has a \u201cbetter grasp\u201d of her treatment and side effects. \u201cFor a long time I wasn\u2019t ready to expose myself to the possible attention and questions I\u2019d have gotten before. I wanted to figure everything out and handle things privately with only those closest to me in the loop.\u201d",
      "Dabrowski and Routliffe won the WTA Finals at the end of this season. The pair also won the U.S. women's doubles title in 2023.",

      "BOSTON -- The Dartmouth men\u2019s basketball team dropped its attempt to form a union on Tuesday, voluntarily ending a push to become the first college sports team to unionize in order to avoid a potentially damaging precedent from a National Labor Relations Board that soon will be controlled by Republicans.",
      "Lawyers for Service Employees International Union Local 560 withdrew their NLRB petition on Tuesday rather than take their chances in front of an unfriendly labor board.",
      "\u201cWhile our strategy is shifting, we will continue to advocate for just compensation, adequate health coverage, and safe working conditions for varsity athletes at Dartmouth,\" SEIU Local 560 President Chris Peck said in a statement that called collective bargaining \u201cthe only viable pathway to address issues\u201d facing college athletics today.",
      "The Dartmouth players petitioned the NLRB in 2023 to be allowed to unionize, saying the New Hampshire school exercised so much control over their schedules and working conditions that they met the legal definition of employees. A regional official agreed, and the team voted 13-2 in March to join SEIU Local 560, which already represents some Dartmouth workers.",

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.",
      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

      "Early Wednesday, 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter \u2014 killing 14 people who were celebrating the New Year. And police fatally shot Jabbar in a following firefight. Just hours after, outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives also burst into flames. The person inside, identified as active-duty U.S. Army Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, died. Officials later said he suffered a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion.",
      "Turo said it is \u201cshocked and saddened\" Wednesday's events and that \u201cour hearts are with the victims and their families.\"",
      "The company added that is \"outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\u201d",
      "While both incidents involved vehicles rented through Turo, the FBI has said that is has found \u201cno definitive link\u201d between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.",
      "Still, the incidents have put a spotlight on the car-sharing platform. Here's what we know about Turo.",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing company. The online platform allows car owners to rent their own vehicles directly to other nearby drivers, or \u201cguests.\u201d \u201cHosts\u201d set their prices, availability and delivery options for renters to choose from and book via Turo's website or app.",
      "Billing itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest car sharing marketplace\" today, Turo says it operates through a network of hosts across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",
      "The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as \u201cRelayRides,\u201d but rebranded to Turo in 2015.",
      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,\u201d the company said. \"We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- South Korean cryptocurrency mogul Do Hyeong Kwon pleaded not guilty Thursday to a freshly unsealed indictment released in time for his first U.S. court appearance.",
      "Kwon entered the plea in Manhattan federal court two days after his extradition from Montenegro.",
      "The indictment alleges that the man dubbed by some as \u201cthe cryptocurrency king\u201d lied to investors from 2018 to 2022 to fool them into pouring money into Terraform Labs, the Singapore crypto firm he cofounded.",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",
      "Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon.",
      "But deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks.",
      "The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication.",
      "The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of what officials have said is a a limited number of individuals. Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed.",

      "The cosmic double-header will repeat in September with an even longer total lunar eclipse over Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, and a partial solar eclipse two weeks later near the bottom of the world.",
      "Three supermoons are on tap this year in October, November and December.",
      "The full moon will look particularly big and bright those three months as it orbits closer to Earth than usual.",
      "November's supermoon will come closest, passing within 221,817 miles (356,980 kilometers). Last year featured four supermoons, wrapping up in November.",
      "Six of our seven neighboring planets will line up in the sky to form a long arc around mid-January. All but Neptune and Uranus should be visible with the naked eye just after sunset, weather permitting.",
      "The parade will continue for weeks, with some of the planets occasionally snuggling up. Mercury will make a cameo appearance by the end of February. The planets will gradually exit, one by one, through spring.",
      "The sun burped big time last year, painting the sky with gorgeous auroras in unexpected places.",
      "Space weather forecasters anticipate more geomagnetic storms that could yield even more northern and southern lights.",
      "That\u2019s because the sun has reached its solar maximum during its current 11-year cycle that could continue through this year.

      "WASHINGTON -- When the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks on Friday, it will be the year's first chance to see fireballs in the sky.",
      "A waning crescent moon means good visibility under clear and dark conditions.",
      "Most meteor showers are named for the constellations where they appear to originate from in the night sky. But the Quadrantids \u201ctake their name from a constellation that doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d said NASA's William Cooke.",

    "story": [
      "Fourteen people were killed in the New Year's Day attack on Bourbon Street.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Thursday issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning the nation's 18,000 law-enforcement agencies about potential copycats seeking to emulate this week's devastating ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans, ABC News has learned.",
      "The bulletin was sent out of an abundance of caution to sensitize law enforcement around the country to be on the lookout for any activity pointing to the use of vehicles as a method to inflict mass casualties, sources told ABC News.",
      "The bulletin notes that ISIS -- to which New Orleans suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar pledged allegiance before the New Orleans attack, according to FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia -- has been promoting the use of vehicles as a terrorism weapon since around 2014.",
      "Sources told ABC News that ISIS has ramped up calls for its supporters to launch low-tech, mass casualty ramming attacks in recent months, especially since the most recent Israel-Hamas conflict began in October 2023.",
      "The bulletin offered law enforcement agencies tips on danger signs of upcoming attacks to look out for, including the use of pre-operational surveillance and fraudulent identity documents or credit to rent vehicles.",
      "The bulletin stated that Jabbar was inspired by ISIS but that there remains no evidence of any co-conspirators. A senior law-enforcement official told ABC News that there is so far no sign of ISIS claiming responsibility for the New Orleans attack.",
      "The ongoing investigation into the New Year's Day attack on Bourbon Street saw bomb-making materials recovered by FBI agents and local law enforcement at a residence linked to the suspect in Houston, Texas, on Thursday, sources confirmed to ABC News.",
      "The items found were also referred to as \"precursor chemicals\" by agents in the field, sources said. They were discovered during the execution of a search warrant at Jabbar's last known residence in the small community of Greenspoint, in north Houston.",
      "Authorities no longer believe there are any other suspects involved in the New Year's truck attack that killed 14 people and injured 35 others, the FBI said Thursday.",
      "Sixteen people remain hospitalized at University Medical Center New Orleans, including eight in intensive care. The death toll is not expected to rise beyond 14 people, Dr. Jeffrey Elder of the University Medical Center New Orleans told ABC News Live on Thursday.",
      "After investigators reviewed all surveillance videos, it appears that Jabbar -- a 42-year-old Army veteran and U.S.-born citizen from Texas, who also died in the attack -- placed explosive devices in the area himself and then changed clothes, multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News.",
      "The FBI is still investigating whether there were individuals Jabbar spoke to or exchanged messages with prior to the early morning Wednesday attack, but no one was in the vicinity to help him do anything, the sources said.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement and the intelligence community are actively investigating any foreign or domestic contacts in connection that could possibly be relevant to the attack,\" President Joe Biden said Thursday.",
      "The FBI's Raia called the attack a premeditated \"act of terrorism\" but said there was no additional threat to the public.",
      "The FBI released new surveillance images of Jabbar in New Orleans a little more than an hour before the attack took place, showing the suspect walking along Dauphine Street near Governor Nicholls Street shortly after 2 a.m., wearing a light brown long coat, jeans and brown dress shoes.",
      "The FBI also released a photo of one of the coolers containing an explosive device that authorities said Jabbar placed near the intersection of Bourbon and Orleans Street.",
      "Surveillance footage showed Jabbar placing two improvised explosive devices in coolers in the Bourbon Street area, Raia said. He had a remote detonator in the truck to set off the two devices, Biden said.",
      "\"Those are the only two devices that we've been able to recover that were functional -- both devices were rendered safe on scene,\" he said.",
      "Jabbar drove from Houston to New Orleans on Tuesday evening and posted several videos online \"proclaiming his support for ISIS,\" and mentioning he joined ISIS before this summer, Raia said.",
      "Jabbar was \"hell-bent\" on killing as many people as possible, driving a pickup truck onto the sidewalk around a parked police car serving as a barricade to plow into pedestrians, officials said.",
      "The suspect mowed down dozens of people over a three-block stretch on the world-famous thoroughfare while firing into the crowd, police said.",
      "Jabbar then exited the damaged vehicle armed with an assault rifle and opened fire on police officers, law enforcement said. He was also armed with a handgun, sources told ABC News.",
      "Officers returned fire, killing Jabbar. At least two officers were injured, one by gunfire and the other when the officer was pinned by the truck, authorities said.",
      "New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said security bollards were not working at the time because they were in the process of being replaced for next month's Super Bowl.",
      "Law enforcement cleared and reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday as the investigation continued. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said authorities had the \"confidence\" to reopen the area to the public ahead of the Sugar Bowl Thursday afternoon, which was initially scheduled for Wednesday but postponed in the wake of the attack.",
      "\"I want to reassure the public that the city of New Orleans is not only ready for game day today, but we're ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city,\" she said. \"Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to the victims' families,\" Cantrell added.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Thursday compared the ongoing investigation to a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "Over 400 tips have been submitted and investigators are combing through Jabbar's laptops and phones, Raia said. More than 1,000 law enforcement officers have been \"pouring over countless amounts of data, of videos, of surveillances, interviews, tracking down every possible lead,\" Landry said.",
      "Authorities have conducted search warrants in New Orleans and outside of Louisiana, the FBI's New Orleans field office said.",
      "There is no apparent direct connection between the New Orleans attack and Wednesday's Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, which is also being investigated as a possible act of terror, Raia from the FBI said Thursday.",
      "Biden said Thursday that investigators \"have not found any evidence of such a connection thus far -- I've directed them to keep looking.\"",
      "The Las Vegas driver was killed and seven bystanders suffered minor injuries, authorities said. The motive behind the incident remains under investigation, but investigators told ABC News they believe it was \"intentional.\"",
      "The Cybertruck was rented via the Turo app, as was the truck used in the New Orleans attack, sources told ABC News.",
      "The Cybertruck driver had an Army special operations background but there is no evidence suggesting he and the New Orleans suspect knew each other, according to officials.",

      "Behind the scenes, President-elect Donald Trump and his top advisers were working to strike a deal with one lawmaker in particular, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, sources told ABC News.",
      "Johnson does appear to have the support of the majority of his conference and has the endorsement of Trump. But there are at least 16 hardliners who won't commit to voting for Johnson and at least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has said publicly he won't vote for Johnson.",
      "Several members of the House Freedom Caucus, including those who won't commit to backing Johnson, were spotted entering the speaker's office on Thursday, including Republican Reps.

      "House Republican leaders formally unveiled their new set of rules for the 119th Congress on Wednesday, which includes a provision that will make it harder to oust a speaker of the House but doesn\u2019t remove the threat.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson and other top Republicans previewed the change at a press conference in November following GOP leadership elections.",
      "Within the proposed rules package, the motion to vacate rule will now require a total of nine sponsors in order to be considered privileged on the House floor.",
      "\u201cA resolution causing a vacancy in the Office of the Speaker shall not be privileged except if it is offered by a member of the majority party and has accumulated eight co-sponsors from the majority party at the time it is offered,\u201d the rules package states.",
      "During the last Congress, a single lawmaker was able to force a vote to \u201cvacate the chair\u201d -- which former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz used to remove then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy and plunged the House into chaos for several weeks before Johnson was elected speaker. Historically, this had been the position of the House, but hard-right Republicans used the tool as a threat to remove then-Speaker John Boehner in 2015. Democrats ultimately changed the rules to require the majority of the House to support the motion when they controlled the House but McCarthy was forced to switch the rule back by hardliners when the GOP got the majority back.",
      "After a speaker is elected, the House will hold a vote on the rules package -- requiring a simple majority for passage. Democrats are not expected to help Republicans clear this package, so Johnson won\u2019t be able to afford many GOP defections. This is typically the House\u2019s second vote they\u2019ll take after the election of the speaker and swearing-in of members.",
      "Johnson's reelection as speaker is not a sure thing. The speaker vote comes after a number of House Republicans grew frustrated with Johnson during the final days of the 118th Congress, which saw a bitter fight over spending that nearly caused a government shutdown before Christmas.",

      "Authorities and residents in Hawaii are wondering whether a New Year's Eve explosion that killed three people and wounded more than 20 will dampen the state's enthusiasm for illegal pyrotechnic displays",
      "HONOLULU -- In recent years, occasions large and small \u2014 parties, Super Bowls, mixed-martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving \u2014 have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks.",
      "The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state's culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter\u2019s home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor.",
      "Each New Year's Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths.",
      "But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night's tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu.",
      "Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down.",
      "\u201cThis incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,\u201d Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. \u201cThey put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis.",
      "The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Gov. Josh Green.",
      "And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year's celebrations.",
      "Rep. Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it\u2019s a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today.",
      "\u201cThe kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the danger is magnified.\u201d",
      "Charmaine Doran, the vice-chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: \u201cThey have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I\u2019m pretty old.\u201d",
      "In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year\u2019s. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day.",
      "Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where \u201cwe\u2019re related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,\u201d Doran said.",
      "People fear retribution, she added: \u201cIf I dial 911, they\u2019re going to egg my house.\u201d",
      "That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threated by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve until after midnight.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,\u201d Takushi said. \u201cHe has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.\u201d",
      "Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state's diverse communities.",
      "Takushi echoed Takayama's point about the big difference between today's large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear.",
      "\u201cA string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,\" Takushi said.",
      "Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu\u2019s hotspots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week's deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives.",
      "He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if \u201cthey can\u2019t catch people in the act.\u201d",
      "Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles.",
      "\u201cWe already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,\u201d he said. \"I mean we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.\u201d",
      "The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii\u2019s ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said.",
      "\u201cWe need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they\u2019re in the community, it\u2019s very difficult to track them down,\u201d Takayama said.",

      "JERUSALEM -- As president, Jimmy Carter brokered the watershed peace agreement that removed Israel\u2019s most powerful enemy from the battlefield. But he incurred the Israeli government's wrath decades later when he said its military rule over the Palestinians amounted to apartheid.",
      "The Camp David peace accords, signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978, remain the biggest achievement from decades of mostly failed U.S. peacemaking in the Middle East.",
      "But for Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, they were clouded by what he saw as the continued oppression of the Palestinians and Israel\u2019s expansion of settlements on lands they want for a future state.",
      "Carter did not speak publicly after entering hospice care, months before the outbreak of the latest war in Gaza. But he devoted much of his life during and after his presidency trying to broker a just solution to the wider conflict.",
      "When Carter assumed office in 1977, Egypt and Israel had fought four devastating wars, the last of which began with an Egyptian surprise attack in 1973 that initially seemed to threaten Israel\u2019s existence.",
      "Carter\u2019s efforts led to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s landmark visit to Jerusalem and saw U.S. negotiators eventually wear down the famously hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.",
      "\u201cThere would not be a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt without President Carter,\u201d said Aharon Barak, a former Israeli attorney general and Supreme Court president who served as the Israeli legal adviser during the negotiations.",
      "Barak described Carter as a dogged negotiator, forcing the sides to work from 6 a.m. until after midnight and getting involved in the smallest details.",
      "\u201cHe was very tough, knew what he wanted, and he got what he wanted. And I admired it,\u201d he said.",
      "The first ever peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country saw Israel withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had captured in the 1967 Mideast war, and forge full diplomatic ties with Egypt, which had led the Arab struggle against Israel since its establishment in 1948.",
      "The two countries remain at peace nearly a half-century later.",
      "Although the Camp David agreements called for a transition to Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel also seized in 1967, it was never carried out. Carter was voted out of office two years later amid the Iran hostage crisis, and Mideast peace efforts languished.",
      "When Israelis and Palestinians finally came together to sign the Oslo Accords in 1993, the plan was similar to the one Carter had written 15 years earlier, with the creation of a Palestinian Authority and Israel\u2019s gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories.",
      "But the peace process stalled out yet again in 2000, when the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement at Camp David. An armed Palestinian uprising erupted months later, and Israel launched a heavy military crackdown.",
      "Carter remained actively engaged in the Middle East as a global campaigner for human rights and democracy, with his Carter Center observing Palestinian elections. He spoke out against the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, calling George W. Bush the worst president in the history of foreign affairs.",
      "In speeches, articles and a controversial book titled \u201cPalestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\u201d he called on the Palestinians to renounce violence and for U.S. intervention to end the conflict.",
      "But he reserved some of his strongest language for Israel\u2019s sprawling Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying they were far more built-up than people knew and undermined hope for a negotiated solution to the century-old conflict.",
      "Most controversial was his contention that the situation in the West Bank \u2014 where some 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule alongside hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers who have full citizenship \u2014 amounts to apartheid.",
      "In a 2007 interview defending the book, Carter said the term was a \u201cvery accurate description\u201d of the \u201ctotal domination and oppression of Palestinians.\u201d",
      "Carter insisted the tough talk was coming from someone who had devoted his life to trying to bring about a lasting peace for Israel, but few Israelis saw it that way. Israel\u2019s supporters said the book was slanted against it and contained a number of inaccuracies.",
      "Israel bristles at any suggestion that its open-ended rule over the Palestinians amounts to apartheid, viewing it as an attack on its very legitimacy. It points to the fact that its own Arab minority has full citizenship, including the right to vote.",
      "Barak rejected the apartheid assertions, saying that as head of the Supreme Court he had presided over numerous rulings in favor of Palestinians against Israeli security bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s not apartheid,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe was a complicated person,\u201d Barak said of Carter. \u201cBut on balance, I think he was a friend of Israel.\u201d",
      "The situation Carter described has only grown worse for the Palestinians. There have been no peace talks in well over a decade, Israel is rapidly expanding settlements, and its far-right government supports outright annexation of parts of the West Bank, making the establishment of a viable Palestinian state virtually impossible.",
      "Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem have meanwhile adopted Carter\u2019s language to describe the conflict, publishing lengthy reports in recent years arguing that Israel is guilty of the international crime of apartheid.",
      "Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch, said Carter\u2019s words were groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cToday, apartheid is the consensus within the global human rights movement and yet, despite the increasingly transparent reality on the ground, few leaders in the U.S. and Europe dare to utter the words President Carter did more than 16 years ago,\u201d Shakir said.",
      "In April 2008, an 83-year-old Carter toured the region with the Elders, a group of retired international leaders founded by Nelson Mandela. He once again courted controversy by meeting with the top leaders of the Islamic militant group Hamas, which had recently seized control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas does not accept Israel\u2019s existence and has carried out hundreds of deadly attacks over the years.",
      "But Carter said he had secured a personal commitment that Hamas would accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders if the agreement were approved in a Palestinian referendum \u2014 a potentially big step toward accepting Israel.",
      "The Israeli government refused to meet with Carter, and both Israel and the U.S. criticized his decision to meet with Hamas.",
      "Israel and Hamas went on to fight five wars in Gaza, the deadliest of which was triggered by a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and is still ongoing.",
      "For Carter, now remembered the world over as a statesman and a humanitarian, the failure to resolve the conflict was a bitter disappointment.",

      "It was a decision that robbed hundreds of athletes of their once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic glory",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- It was a decision that robbed hundreds of athletes of their once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic glory, and for more than four decades, it weighed heavily on the man who made it \u2014 Jimmy Carter.",
      "Carter\u2019s passing Sunday has unearthed memories from his 1977-1981 presidency. Somewhere between his greatest foreign-policy success (the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt) and his greatest failure (the Iran hostage crisis) sits the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.",
      "It was Carter who called for that boycott \u2014 a Cold War power play intended to express America\u2019s disdain for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter said the invasion \u201ccould pose the most serious threat to world peace since the second World War.\u201d",
      "The boycott garnered more than two-thirds support from the 2,400 members of the unwieldy U.S. Olympic Committee house of delegates, the governing body that made the official move to keep the athletes out of Moscow. In short time, that move came to be seen as the textbook example of the risks, confusion and low success rate of injecting politics into sports.",
      "\u201cWe were not allowed to go for a not-so-clear reason,\u201d said Edwin Moses, the hurdling great who won 122 straight races between 1977 and 1987, which included the Olympic gold-medal contests in 1976 and 1984.",
      "For decades, members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team \u2014 recognized as Olympians at home but not by the International Olympic Committee abroad \u2014 told stories about opportunities missed and dreams unfulfilled because of the trip to Moscow they never took. Of the 474 athletes who had qualified for the team in 1980, 227 would not get another chance to compete in the Olympic Games.",
      "Many athletes told stories of meeting Carter at a White House visit in the summer of 1980 that served as a tepid substitute. In Washington, the athletes received the highest honor civilians can receive from Congress: the Congressional gold medal. But those medals were only gold-plated bronze, not pure gold, and they weren\u2019t recorded in the Congressional record until a push was made nearly three decades later.",
      "Swimmer Jesse Vassallo, a reigning world champion in multiple events at the time, told Swimming World Magazine about meeting Carter in the reception line.",
      "Carter \u201creached out to shake my hand and he said \u2018How would you have done in Moscow?\u2019\u201d Vassallo recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I would have won two golds and a silver.\u2019 And he just gave me this (pained) look. He didn\u2019t ask anybody else that question.\u201d Wrestler Jeff Blatnick, a champion on the 1984 Olympic team, met Carter on an airplane years later. According to an essay written by the late USOC spokesman Mike Moran, Blatnick said: \u201cHe looks at me and says, \u2018Were you on the 1980 hockey team?\u2019 I say, \u2018No sir, I\u2019m a wrestler, on the summer team.\u2019 He says, \u2018Oh, that was a bad decision, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d",
      "In his 2021 biography on the 39th President, Kai Bird writes that the boycott was a byproduct of a hard line Carter decided to take against the Soviets at the urging of his national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had been in a long-running struggle with the less-hawkish Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, to influence Carter\u2019s thinking. \"History would prove Vance correct; Brzezinski\u2019s \u2018Carter Doctrine\u2019 never amounted to much more than a cover for wasteful arms exports,\u201d Bird wrote.",
      "And Carter\u2019s boycott did nothing to deter the Soviets. They stayed in Afghanistan for another nine years, while further disrupting the Olympic movement and America\u2019s own turn as an Olympic host four years later. The Soviets and 13 other countries, mostly from the Eastern Bloc, boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 in retaliation for what the Americans had done to Moscow four years earlier.",
      "Forty-four years after Carter\u2019s fateful decision, the Olympics remain every bit as politicized and polarized as they were back then. And for the past several years, the world has grappled with Russia\u2019s place in international sports in the wake of another invasion \u2014 this time, into neighboring Ukraine.",
      "How that war is resolved will help define Russia's role when the Olympics come back to Los Angeles in 2028.",

      "But there were also stinging failures, including the Iran hostage crisis -- a 444-day chapter of Carter's term during which 53 American diplomats and private citizens were held captive inside the U.S. embassy in Tehran.",
      "However, historians and analysts say understanding Carter's true impact requires looking far beyond the relatively short time he spent as leader of the free world, and that the former president -- once rejected as a failure -- has wielded an outsize influence on international affairs that will reverberate for years to come.",
      "When Carter left the White House in 1981, it was under a cloud of failure. In the wake of his punishing defeat by Ronald Reagan, Carter told one of his biographers that he was hopelessly distraught and wanted nothing more than to lie low in his native Georgia.",
      "That all changed, he said, when a cataclysmic event sent shockwaves through the Middle East: the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.",
      "Carter had worked alongside Sadat to broker the Camp David Accords, and in the process, the world leaders forged a deep, personal bond.",
      "While Carter was celebrated for his part in the negotiations, Sadat was lambasted by his own countrymen. Carter said he viewed the Egyptian leader's death at the hands of jihadists as Sadat paying the ultimate price for peace they had brokered in the wooded mountains of Maryland.",
      "Carter later credited that sacrifice for pulling him from his despair and eventually leading him to found The Carter Presidential Center -- a multifaceted nonprofit aimed at promoting human rights, with missions as varied as election monitoring and eradicating parasitic diseases.",
      "However, Carter's focus on easing suffering around the world was not a post-presidential pursuit so much as a return to form.",
      "On the campaign trail in the mid-1970s, Carter had vowed to make advancing human rights a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy -- a significant shift for the time.",
      "\"Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clear-cut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights,\" he declared in his inaugural address.",
      "That sentiment is what drove Carter in 1979 to conclude negotiations with Panama aimed at giving the Central American nation control of the Panama Canal, administered by the U.S since construction began in 1904 (and now something President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to reassert).",
      "The State Department credits that development for enabling \"the United States to defend itself from charges of imperialism made by Soviet-aligned states\" and boosting cooperating between the U.S. and Panama.",
      "Yet, despite Carter's intentions, he sometimes wavered, and the actions he took in pursuit of his self-described \"fairness not force\" doctrine were prone to backfire, according to Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"Carter was a foreign policy neophyte, idealistic about efforts to achieve Middle East peace and driven by a Christian faith that informed his vocal but inconsistent focus on human rights,\" he said.",
      "Takeyh points to Carter's decision to turn a blind eye towards human rights abuses committed by the Iranian shah's government -- an influential partner in the fight against Soviet influence -- as an example of that inconsistency.",
      "Carter's critics say that blind spot also obscured the looming Iranian revolution and clouded his judgment of the newly installed regime, setting in motion a series of decisions that would foment the hostage crises and irreparably sour relations between Washington and Tehran.",
      "After Carter was once again caught off-guard by the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, he \"responded with increasingly hawkish actions,\" including \"an aggressive national security strategy focused on the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East\" -- foreshadowing the decades of war in the region to come, according to Takeyh.",
      "However, other analysts argue that Carter's open embrace of human rights was actually a subtle success -- but one that took years to come fully into focus.",
      "Reagan, Carter's successor, is often credited with bringing about the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with it, the end of the Cold War. But Daniel Fried, a former U.S ambassador to Poland and distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, argues that Carter's contributions are overlooked.",
      "\"Introducing human rights into U.S. bilateral relations meant that the default Cold War policy that a reliably anticommunist government could be embraced,\" Fried said, adding that it meant tolerating authoritarian rule was \"no longer automatic.\"",
      "\"By elevating human rights in the mix of U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Soviet bloc relations, Carter put the United States on offense in the Cold War and on the side of the people of the region,\" he added.",
      "Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americans program at Chatham House, describes Carter's elevation of human rights as \"visionary.\"",
      "\"It came at a time when the promotion of human rights was seen to be at odds with the more central priorities of a superpower during the Cold War,\" she said.",
      "Vinjamuri says that approach continued to serve Carter in the four decades following his time in the White House as he pushed to advance peace and democracy around the world, orchestrating missions to Bosnia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Haiti.",
      "Still Carter's willingness to put people and personal relationships at the heart of foreign diplomacy can be seen as either a bug or a feature of his approach.",
      "Both during and after his presidency, Carter's willingness to meet face-to-face with communist leaders and deepen ties with the nations they led repeatedly sparked controversy.",
      "In 1979, Carter severed formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan -- choosing to recognize Beijing as the sole legal government of China, effectively creating Washington's \"One China policy.\"",
      "Congress swiftly retaliated by passing the Taiwan Relations Act, requiring the U.S. to provide defensive arms to Taiwan -- legislation that Carter signed. The two steps, seemingly at odds, set the tone for the complicated and deeply consequential relationship between the powers that exists to this very day.",
      "More than two decades later, Carter became the first president in or out of office to visit Cuba since the country's revolution in 1959. While some heralded the 2002 trip as a groundbreaking step to promote democracy that cemented Carter's status as an accomplished statesman, others slammed the former president -- accusing him of legitimizing Cuba's President Fidel Castro and his regime.",
      "But Carter's willingness to cross boundaries in pursuit of what he saw as global good did not end with world leaders.",
      "The same year Carter traveled to Cuba, he also journeyed to Africa -- visiting several countries where the AIDS/HIV epidemic was still ravaging populations and deeply stigmatizing.",
      "There, alongside former South African President Nelson Mandela, Carter cradled babies infected with the virus, lovingly holding the infants as cameras snapped pictures.",
      "Dr. Helene Gayle, the president of Spelmen College, who accompanied Mandela and Carter on the trip, says it's a scene she will never forget.",
      "\"They wanted to show everyone that these babies were no harm to anyone, including world leaders,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:32:24 -0500",
    "summary": "During and after his presidency, Jimmy Carter spent years working to advance global public health, including helping to nearly eradicate one disease.",
    "story": [
      "Carter strove to help nearly eliminate Guinea worm disease, and more.",
      "As world leaders mourn the death of former President Jimmy Carter and remark on his political and policy legacy, doctors are remembering his efforts to prevent disease, and his legacy in furthering global public health.",
      "The 39th president spent five decades working to eradicate a parasitic disease, helped organize a major-drug donation program, and made advancements addressing the mental health crisis in the U.S.",
      "Dr. Julie Jacobson, currently a managing partner of the nonprofit Bridges to Development, helped to provide funding for the Carter Center's work in the Americas, Nigeria and Ethiopia while she worked for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for over a decade.",
      "\"He was hugely influential, I think particularly for the diseases that most of the world doesn't appreciate even exist,\" Jacobson told ABC News of Jimmy Carter's work. \"He was a true champion for the neglected tropical diseases, which are some of the most common infections of people who live with the least resources. And he found these diseases and then really wanted to do something about them, and used his voice, his influence, his passion, to continue to push forward where others were really not interested.\"",
      "Near-eradication of Guinea worm disease",
      "Following his loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, Carter founded the Carter Center in 1982, a non-profit organization that \"seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health,\" according to the Center's website.",
      "Among the organization's many efforts, the Carter Center helped spearhead a successful international campaign with the goal of eradicating dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease, a parasitic infection caused by consuming contaminated drinking water.",
      "Water from ponds or other stagnant bodies of water can contain tiny crustaceans commonly known as water fleas, which in turn can be infected with Guinea worm larvae, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "About one year after infecting a human host, the Guinea worm creates a blister on the skin and emerges from it, which can cause burning pain, fever and swelling, according to the CDC and the World Health Organization.",
      "\"Nobody else wanted to take it on,\" Jimmy Carter told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos during a 2015 interview on \"Good Morning America\". \"So, I decided to take it on.\"",
      "In 1986, Guinea worm disease afflicted 3.5 million people every year in 21 African and Asian countries. Disease incidence has since been reduced by 99.99%, to just 14 \"provisional\" human cases in 2023, according to the Carter Center.",
      "Jacobson said that success is even more remarkable because there are no vaccines available to prevent Guinea worm disease and no drugs to treat it. Tracking Guinea worm disease, according to Jacobson, involves following possible cases for a year to determine if they are infected, checking to see if infected humans have any infected water sources near them, and monitoring the community as a whole.",
      "\"To think that you could eradicate a disease without any tools is really still just a crazy idea, but he did it with perseverance and working with people in the grassroots within communities and putting together teams of people to go and work with people in those communities and empower the communities,\" Jacobson said.",
      "The Carter Center says if efforts are successful, Guinea worm disease could become the second human disease in history to be completely eradicated, after smallpox, and the first to be done without the use of a vaccine or medicine.",
      "Carter told ABC News during the 2015 interview that eradicating the disease entirely was his goal: \"I think this is going to be a great achievement for, not for me, but for the people that have been afflicted and for the entire world to see diseases like this eradicated.\"",
      "Mass drug distribution for river blindness",
      "The Carter Center also works to fight other preventable diseases, including the parasitic infections schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis \u2013 more commonly known as snail fever and elephantiasis, respectively \u2013 as well as trachoma, which is one of the world's leading causes of preventable blindness. It's also working with the governments of Haiti and the Dominican Republic to eliminate lymphatic filariasis and malaria from the island of Hispaniola, which both countries share and which is \"the last reservoir in the Caribbean for both diseases,\" according to the Carter Center.",
      "Carter and his organization also played a part in organizing a major drug-donation program to help eliminate onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is transmitted to human through repeated bites of infected blackflies, according to the CDC.",
      "Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. had been implementing field studies in Africa which showed that the drug ivermectin was effective at treating river blindness in humans. The Carter Center partnered with Merck to mass-distribute ivermectin, brand name Mectizan, \"as much as needed for as long as needed\" in Africa and Latin America. To date, the Carter Center has assisted in distributing more than 500 million treatments of Mectizan, according to Merck.",
      "In 1995, Carter negotiated a two-month cease-fire in Sudan to allow health care workers there to more safely help eradicate Guinea worm disease, prevent river blindness, and vaccinate children against polio.",
      "\"When we have known solutions, it is ethical to make sure they're available to the people who need it most,\" Dr. Usha Ramakrishnan, chair of the Department of Global Health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"And that's where we were with river blindness. There was a treatment, but improving access to medications, making it affordable, reaching the people they need was very much along the lines of the work [the Carter Center] was doing.\"",
      "Addressing mental health",
      "Carter was also committed to tackling mental health issues. During his presidency, he created the Presidential Commission on Mental Health, which recommended a national plan to care for people with chronic mental illness.",
      "Although it was never adopted as policy by the Reagan administration, the plan's recommended strategies were adopted by some mental health advocacy groups to \"make gains in the 1980s,\" according to one study.",
      "Carter also signed into law the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which provided funding to community mental health centers.",
      "After his presidency, Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter continued working to improve access to mental health.",
      "Ramakrishnan said the Carters' work helped to reduce some of the stigma associated with mental health.",
      "\"There continues to be a lot of stigma, but they truly got it out [in] the conversation and mainstreaming mental health as an important aspect of health and well-being,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"There's still a lot of challenges, and there are many capable people that they have mentored and trained who are carrying that mantle forward.\"",

    "summary": "Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay has died at age 91",
    "story": [
      "Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay has died at age 91",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Jeb Bush in 1998 but still served 23 days in office after the sudden death of Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died. He was 91.",
      "The former Democratic governor took a nap after lunch at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on Tuesday and never woke up, his son Ken MacKay told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt was a very peaceful end to a great life,\u201d MacKay said.",
      "Buddy MacKay, Chiles' lieutenant governor for two terms, had been trounced by Bush in the 1998 gubernatorial election when Chiles died six weeks later on Dec. 12, 1998, at the governor's mansion. That put MacKay in the top job for three weeks, where he focused on overseeing the final stages of the transition to Bush's administration.",
      "\u201cIt was overwhelmingly sad,\u201d MacKay recalled in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press. \"(Chiles had) gotten that far through his term and it all just stopped. For me, there was nothing but to be a caretaker and try to help with the transition. The main thing we could do was stay out of the way.\u201d",
      "The MacKays never moved into the mansion.",
      "\"He was very, very sensitive to the fact he was there as the final caretaker,\" the late Democratic political strategist and MacKay adviser Jim Krog once said. \"He was clearly conscious of the fact that he was governor and there were some loose ends that needed to be tied up.\"",
      "MacKay was out of politics in 1990 when he persuaded Chiles, who had retired from the U.S. Senate two years earlier, to run for governor against incumbent Republican Bob Martinez. The Chiles-MacKay team was elected that November and again in 1994.",
      "MacKay, who also served in the Florida Legislature and U.S. House of Representatives, ran statewide three times and lost each time, but never lost his quiet sense of humor.",
      "\u201cI got out of politics because of illness,\u201d he said the day after being defeated by Bush. \u201cThe voters got sick and tired of me.\u201d",
      "An inveterate policy wonk, MacKay finished his political career as a special envoy to Latin America for President Bill Clinton before retiring to his central Florida home near Ocala. MacKay stood by the former president when many Democrats distanced themselves from Clinton in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He kept busy in the final years of his life doing pro bono work for the Southern Legal Counsel and also serving in a mediation role in the juvenile court system.",
      "MacKay narrowly missed winning election to the U.S. Senate race in 1988 when he lost to Republican Connie Mack III by less than 1 percentage point. It was the closest statewide race in the state's history until the 2000 presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore.",
      "In a Democratic primary field that at one time included former governors Claude Kirk \u2014 a one-time Republican \u2014 and Reubin Askew, who withdrew before the election, MacKay rebounded from a runner-up finish in a six-way primary to win a runoff against then-Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter.",
      "With Democrats still largely in control of Florida politics, MacKay was expected to sweep past Mack and hold Chiles' seat.",
      "But Mack, who had also been in the U.S. House, came up with a \"Hey Buddy, you're a liberal,\" catchphrase that MacKay couldn't shake at a time moderate Florida was moving away from traditional Democratic politics.",
      "It took two days after the 1988 election before the official vote count showed Mack had won, by fewer than 34,000 votes out of more than 4 million cast.",
      "Like many of Florida's leading Democratic politicians of the second half of the 20th century, MacKay began his political career at the height of the state's integration movement.",
      "MacKay had grown up working in the fields with Black laborers but went to segregated schools and ate in segregated restaurants.",
      "\"It was fairly wrenching,\" he said. \"It was always very awkward. My family was involved with agriculture and I worked many days in the field with African American crews and some of those adults were part of our family and raised me.\"",
      "MacKay's views on race and the potential for desegregation changed dramatically during his time in the U.S. Air Force between 1955 and 1958.",
      "\"Not until I went into the military did I see the potential for getting this behind us,\" MacKay said. \"I walked in there and from the first day it was totally integrated and there wasn't a problem. It was a very freeing experience.\"",
      "Kenneth H. MacKay Jr. was born March 22, 1933, in Ocala.",
      "\u201cIn the old South, which I was born into, 'Buddy' means junior,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cJudges and school teachers called me Kenneth, but nobody else did. I'm more of a Buddy than a Kenneth.\u201d",
      "He became an attorney and citrus grower after leaving the service. He won election to the state House in 1968, the state Senate in 1974 and to the U.S. House in 1982 before losing his U.S. Senate bid.",

      "President Joe Biden said on Wednesday there is \"no justification\" for what he called the \"horrific\" attack early on New Year's Day in New Orleans, noting that the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.",
      "\"I have been continually briefed since early this morning by federal law enforcement leadership and my homeland security team, including Secretary of Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and the Mayor of New Orleans regarding the horrific incident that occurred there overnight,\" Biden said in a written statement.",
      "At least 15 people were killed and 25 injured when a vehicle rammed into a crowd gathered on Bourbon Street, authorities said.",
      "Police say the driver was \"hell-bent\" on causing damage as they drove on the street at a very fast pace in the early morning hours Wednesday. The driver then exited the vehicle with an assault weapon, and was shot and killed by officers.",
      "\"I am grateful for the brave and swift response of local law enforcement in preventing even greater death and injury,\" Biden said. \"I have directed my team to ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.\"",
      "\"I will continue to receive updates throughout the day, and I will have more to say as we have further information to share. In the meantime, my heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday,\" the president added in the statement. \"There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities.\"",
      "Biden briefly spoke about the attack as he departed Delaware to travel to Camp David, though he declined to comment on specific questions from reporters regarding the suspect's identity.",
      "\"I've contacted every agency in the federal government, as well as the state. They're all coordinating to get -- get to the bare facts,\" he said.",
      "The suspect was later identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas, according to the FBI. Authorities are working to determine whether the deceased suspect had any affiliation with terrorist organizations after an ISIS flag was located in the vehicle, the FBI said.",
      "The president said his first reaction to learning about the violence was \"one of anger and frustration\" and that he would have more to say soon.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump also weighed in on the tragedy, calling it \"pure evil.\"",
      "\"Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!\" Trump wrote in a statement on his conservative social media platform.",
      "\"When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,\" Trump falsely implied, hours before the FBI identified the suspect as a U.S. citizen from Texas.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana native, also called the violence \"pure evil.\"",
      "\"The vicious attack on innocent people celebrating the New Year in New Orleans early this morning was an act of pure evil, and justice must be swift for anyone who was involved,\" Johnson wrote on X. \"Please join us in praying for the victims, their families, and the first responders and investigators on the scene.\"",
      "Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, also a Republican, called the incident \"tragic\" but said he believed the Sugar Bowl -- an annual college football game played in New Orleans on New Year's Day -- should go on.",
      "\"The terrorists win if we don't live our lives. We must live our lives. Otherwise, one more time, they win and they can't win. We've got to track them down, we've got to hunt them down, we've got to find out their supporting network, and we've got to bring them to justice,\" Cassidy said on Fox News.",

Flights were delayed by up to three hours late Friday because of poor weather conditions, and at least 40 flights from the airport, mostly short-haul to Europe, were delayed Saturday morning.",

      "Authorities and residents in Hawaii are wondering whether a New Year's Eve explosion that killed three people and wounded more than 20 will dampen the state's enthusiasm for illegal pyrotechnic displays",
      "HONOLULU -- In recent years, occasions large and small \u2014 parties, Super Bowls, mixed-martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving \u2014 have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks.",
      "The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state's culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter\u2019s home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor.",
      "Each New Year's Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths.",
      "But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night's tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu.",
      "Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down.",
      "\u201cThis incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,\u201d Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. \u201cThey put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis.",
      "The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Gov. Josh Green.",
      "And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year's celebrations.",
      "Rep. Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it\u2019s a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today.",
      "\u201cThe kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the danger is magnified.\u201d",
      "Charmaine Doran, the vice-chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: \u201cThey have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I\u2019m pretty old.\u201d",
      "In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year\u2019s. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day.",
      "Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where \u201cwe\u2019re related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,\u201d Doran said.",
      "People fear retribution, she added: \u201cIf I dial 911, they\u2019re going to egg my house.\u201d",
      "That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threated by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve until after midnight.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,\u201d Takushi said. \u201cHe has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.\u201d",
      "Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state's diverse communities.",
      "Takushi echoed Takayama's point about the big difference between today's large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear.",
      "\u201cA string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,\" Takushi said.",
      "Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu\u2019s hotspots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week's deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives.",
      "He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if \u201cthey can\u2019t catch people in the act.\u201d",
      "Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles.",
      "\u201cWe already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,\u201d he said. \"I mean we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.\u201d",
      "The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii\u2019s ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said.",
      "\u201cWe need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they\u2019re in the community, it\u2019s very difficult to track them down,\u201d Takayama said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The federal courts will not refer allegations that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may have violated ethics laws to the Justice Department, the judiciary's policymaking body said Thursday.",
      "Thomas has agreed to follow updated requirements on reporting trips and gifts, including clearer guidelines on hospitality from friends, the U.S. Judicial Conference wrote to Democratic senators who had called for an investigation into undisclosed acceptance of luxury trips.",
      "Thomas has previously said he wasn\u2019t required to disclose the many trips he and his wife took that were paid for by wealthy benefactors like Republican megadonor Harlan Crow because they are close personal friends. The court didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",
      "The Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 in the face of sustained criticism, though the new code still lacks a means of enforcement.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the law allows the U.S. Judicial Conference to make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice, U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad wrote. He serves as secretary for the conference, which sets policy for the federal court system and is led by Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "A referral in this case isn\u2019t necessary, Conrad said, because two Democratic senators called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel over the summer. No such appointment has been publicly made.",
      "The group Fix the Court said the financial disclosure law is clear and should apply to justices. \u201cThe Conference\u2019s letters further underscore the need for Congress to create a new and transparent mechanism to investigate the justices for ethics violations since the Conference is unwilling to act upon the one method we had presumed existed to do that,\u201d Executive Director Gabe Roth said in a statement.",
      "Conrad also sent a similar response to a separate complaint from a conservative legal group, the Center for Renewing America, in regard to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s reports on the source of her husband's consulting income. Jackson has since amended her disclosures and also agreed to updated reporting requirements, Conrad wrote."

      "DENVER -- A gray wolf in Colorado was illegally shot and later died of the injury, federal authorities said Thursday in the latest flashpoint of Colorado's controversial, voter-driven initiative to reintroduce the predators to the state.",
      "Colorado residents largely in cities voted to reintroduce the animals in 2020, clashing with those in rural areas who feared attacks on their livestock. The first 10 wolves were released a year ago, and since then there have been over two dozen claims of depredations \u2014 when wolves kill livestock or working dogs.",
      "The wolf was part of the Copper Creek Pack which was captured in late August after the pack repeatedly killed local livestock in Grand County, just northwest of Denver, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The wolf died in early September and the investigation is ongoing.",
      "Officials said the wolf was found in poor condition, emaciated with injuries to its right hind leg, which a necropsy revealed was caused by the gunshot wound. Wolves are protected under the Endangered Species Act in the state, and it's a federal crime to kill, injure or harass them without federal authority.",
      "Colorado officials anticipate releasing 30 to 50 wolves within the next five years with the goal of filling one of the last major holes in the western U.S. for the species, which in years past has ranged from northern Canada to the desert southwest.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear laughed off some unflattering comments aimed at him on social media in the past year, and had his teenage son translate what one barb meant, in a light-hearted video that shows his willingness to occasionally poke fun at himself.",
      "Continuing an end-of-the-year tradition, Beshear and his wife, Britainy, read several posts from 2024 that took jabs at him. It's their version of late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s segment where celebrities read mean posts directed at them on the social media platform X.",
      "Beshear, who has been mentioned as a potential contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, read one message that said: \u201cAndy, I love you but you have zero aura.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wish I knew what that meant, but it doesn\u2019t sound good,\" the governor said.",
      "He called his son, Will, to translate, asking him: \u201cSo is that like a good thing?\u201d His son replied it wasn't, saying it meant \"you have zero coolness.\u201d",
      "Laughing it off, the governor got in the last word, saying he has \u201cso much aura.\u201d",
      "When another post commented on Beshear's physical appearance, saying he has \u201cno abs,\u201d his wife replied that they had invested in a rowing machine, so \u201dlook out.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you for letting the world know about the rowing machine,\u201d the governor replied.",
      "He also read two competing posts, one that said: \u201cAndy Beshear sounded like a goober\u201d and the other that said Beshear is \"the goober that America needs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got you, America,\u201d the governor said.",
      "Beshear ended the video on a more serious note, saying Kentucky had \u201canother great year\u201d and urging viewers to \u201chug on the people that you love.\u201d Since he became governor in late 2019, Kentucky has achieved its first-, second- and fourth-best years ever for private-sector investments.",
      "Beshear is one of several Democratic governors who are the subject of early speculation as potential contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2028. Beshear's second term as governor ends in late 2027 and term limits mean he can't run for reelection then.",
      "He recently said his focus will remain on jobs, infrastructure, education and health care in 2025. Beshear mentioned those same issues during a recent sit-down interview with The Associated Press when he gave suggestions on what Democrats should look for in their next presidential nominee on everything from more affordable health care to pro-public education and greater public safety in communities.",
      "\u201cI think the next Democratic nominee should be a pragmatist that is about getting things done, getting real results,\u201d he said."

Researchers have warned they are on the brink of extinction.",

      "California is beginning 2025 with a solid start to the winter snowpack, but more storms are needed to keep the state\u2019s water supplies on track",
      "PHILLIPS STATION, Calif. -- California is beginning 2025 with a solid start to the winter snowpack, officials said Thursday, but they cautioned that more storms are needed to keep the state's water supplies on track.",
      "Officials at Phillips Station in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state, recorded a snow depth of 24 inches (61 centimeters), said Andy Reising, manager of the Department of Water Resources' snow surveys and water supply forecasting unit.",
      "The water content of the snowpack at the station was 91% of the average to date and 37% of the average on April 1, when the Sierra snowpack is typically at its peak, he said.",
      "\u201cAs of right now, I am feeling OK, but ... we'll need a progression of monthly storms to keep going,\u201d Reising said, adding that the northern half of the state has seen a series of storms but the south has been dry.",
      "The snowpack functions as a huge frozen reservoir, providing nearly a third of the water used annually in California as it melts and runs off into streams and rivers in the spring. The state has built a complex system of canals and dams to capture that water and store it in huge reservoirs so it can be used the rest of the year when it doesn\u2019t rain or snow.",
      "The measurements are closely watched in California, which is the nation\u2019s most populous state with 39 million people, and also responsible for growing more than a third of the country\u2019s vegetables and three-quarters of its fruit and nuts. The health of the snowpack helps determine whether California will have a difficult time providing water throughout the summer to farms and cities.",
      "Many of California\u2019s state-run reservoirs are at two-thirds or three-quarters of their capacity, and well above the historical average for the start of the year, thanks to two years of above-average snowpack conditions, state data shows. Last week, California officials told farms and cities that rely on state water supplies that they would get more water than previously planned because of strong storms at the end of 2024. They can now expect to get 15% of their requested supplies instead of 5%, and that number could go up if the wet weather continues.",
      "The survey was the first in a seasonal series of manual measurements at Phillips Station. The department also collects measurements with electronic instruments at other sites, and said that statewide the snowpack is 108% of average.",
      "A year ago, the state began the season with below-normal mountain snowpack and a water content of about 25% of the average. By April, the water content measured 110% of the average. That followed a massive snowpack to start 2023, after a series of atmospheric rivers helped pull the state out of a three-year drought.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a $20,000 diamond from India\u2019s leader.",
      "The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of Egypt.",
      "The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents, including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South Korea\u2019s recently impeached President Suk Yeol Yoon, a $3,495 statue of Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically \u2014 but not always \u2014 transferred to the National Archives or put on official displays.",
      "The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives. The first lady's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the diamond's use.",
      "Recipients also have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S. government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with high-end items.",
      "According to the State Department\u2019s Office of Protocol, which compiles the list that will be published in Friday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000 combined.",
      "CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a telescope and astrological camera, from an foreign source whose identity is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000 Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury timepieces.",
      "Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring bracelet, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100.",
      "All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a $30,000 women\u2019s jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA employee.",
      "Another CIA employee reported receiving a men\u2019s Yacht Master II Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady\u2019s Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a $7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed, according to the list.",
      "Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report says."

      "Wisconsin election officials are launching an investigation into how nearly 200 absentee ballots went uncounted in Madison",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Nearly 200 absentee ballots somehow went uncounted in Wisconsin's liberal capital after the Nov. 5 election, prompting state election officials to launch an investigation Thursday into whether the city clerk broke the law.",
      "The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted unanimously to investigate whether Madison City Clerk Maribeth Wetzel-Biehl failed to comply with state law or abused her discretion. Commission members said they were concerned the clerk's office didn't inform them of the problem until late December, almost a month and a half after the election. Commission Chair Ann Jacobs certified Wisconsin's election results on Nov. 29.",
      "Wetzel-Biehl's office said in a statement that the number of uncounted votes didn't affect the outcome of any race or referendum on the ballots. But Jacobs said the oversight was \u201cso egregious\u201d that the commission must determine what happened and how it can be prevented as spring elections approach.",
      "\u201cWe are the final canvassers,\" Jacobs said. \u201cWe are the final arbiters of votes in the state of Wisconsin and we need to know why those ballots weren't included anywhere.\u201d",
      "Wetzel-Biehl said in an email to The Associated Press that her office looks forward to working with the commission to determine what happened and how to prevent the same issues in future elections.",
      "It\u2019s another misstep for Wetzel-Biehl, who announced in September that her office mistakenly sent out up to 2,000 duplicate absentee ballots. She blamed it on a data processing error.",
      "According to election commission documents, the commission learned of the uncounted ballots on Dec. 18, when Wetzel-Biehl's staff told the commission that they recorded more absentee ballots as received than ballots counted in three city wards.",
      "The commission asked Wetzel-Biehl to provide a detailed statement, which she did two days later. The memo stated that on Nov. 12, the clerk\u2019s office discovered 67 unprocessed ballots for Ward 65 and one unprocessed ballot for Ward 68 in a courier bag found in a vote tabulating machine.",
      "The memo also stated that her office was reconciling ballots for Ward 56 on Dec. 3 when 125 unprocessed ballots were discovered in a sealed courier bag. Reconciliation is a post-election process in which officials account for every ballot created. That work begins immediately after an election. Clerks have 45 days to complete it.",
      "The memo does not offer any explanation, saying only that the clerk's office planned \u201cto debrief these incidents and implement better processes.\u201d",
      "The clerk's office issued a statement on Dec. 26 saying it had informed the elections commission and would send an apology letter to each affected voter.",
      "Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway released her own statement the same day saying the clerk's office didn't tell her staff about the problem until Dec. 20. She said her office plans to review the city's election procedures.",
      "\u201cWhile the discovery of these unprocessed absentee ballots did not impact the results of any election or referendum, a discrepancy of this magnitude is unacceptable,\u201d the mayor said in the statement.",
      "Wisconsin is a perennial battleground state in presidential elections. Republican Donald Trump won the state this past November on his way to reclaiming the White House, beating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris by about 29,000 votes.",
      "Madison and surrounding Dane County are well-known liberal strongholds. Harris won 75% of the vote in the county in November."

    "story": [
      "While West Virginia's employee health insurance program covers drugs like Ozempic for people with type 2 diabetes, officials decided to indefinitely pause covering their use for weight loss patients because of the cost",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Lory Osborn says the Wegovy she was prescribed 15 months ago did more than help her lose 75 pounds \u2014 over a quarter of her body weight. The administrative assistant at West Virginia University said she feels healthier at 62 than she has since graduating high school.",
      "But lately, she's been having panic attacks because she fears running out of medication. Citing a gross cost of $1.4 million a month, West Virginia abruptly announced in March it would indefinitely pause a pilot program covering weight loss drugs for 1,000 public employees, leaving patients like her scrambling. West Virginia\u2019s Public Employee Insurance Agency (PEIA) will continue covering the popular and expensive GLP-1 drugs to treat Type 2 diabetes.",
      "Other state and private insurers have adopted similar stances for the drugs, which can cost patients more than $1,000 monthly out-of-pocket. In 2024, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the state\u2019s largest nonprofit insurer, and North Carolina's state employee public insurance agency stopped covering the drugs for weight loss, saying the cost increased premiums for all customers.",
      "The dilemma comes amid a similar debate at the federal level. President Joe Biden unveiled a plan in November to cover the drugs for millions of weight loss patients on Medicaid and Medicare, though the measure could face opposition from President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, has criticized Ozempic \u2014 a GLP-1 used to treat diabetes.",
      "Proponents say long-term savings could outweigh the cost \u2014 especially in West Virginia, which has the nation's highest rates of obesity and diabetes. Obesity increases their risk for conditions such as heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. About half of West Virginians rely on Medicare or Medicaid for insurance.",
      "Osborn said it makes no sense for West Virginia to invest the money in the pilot only for patients to come off it and lose their progress. Osborn usually takes her injections once weekly, but said she started waiting 10 or 12 days to make her final three-month supply last.",
      "\u201cIt is so cruel,\u201d said Osborn, who took her last PEIA-covered dose of Wegovy weeks ago. \u201cWe are suffering mentally just from the thought of going back.\u201d",
      "West Virginia\u2019s residents are among the poorest in the U.S. and the state is home to rural food deserts where it can be hard to find any grocery stores, never mind finding one with a variety of nutritional food options.",
      "Outgoing West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice \u2014 who has lost between 30 and 50 pounds while taking Ozempic \u2014 said after Biden's announcement that he would \u201cbe a proponent of trying to do everything we can to be able to expand these drugs to everybody.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s a real argument that at the end of the day, we end up saving that money,\" said Justice, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in November. About 25% of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight loss drugs, according to the AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus, a database produced by the Leverage consulting firm.",
      "The vast majority of coverage of the drugs is provided by government health plans, largely state Medicaid plans, according to Leverage. All state Medicaid programs cover the drugs for Type 2 diabetes, but only 14 provide some form of coverage to treat obesity. Medicare plans cover the drugs for weight loss if they are prescribed to a person at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Dr. Laura Davisson, medical weight management director at West Virginia University, said losing coverage for medications is a \u201cnightmare\u201d for patients. This year, Davisson\u2019s office saw over 1,000 GLP-1 patients \u2014 many of whom have made extra appointments or joined support groups with her staff to discuss options when they learned of the coverage changes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the state with the number one rate of obesity, and I\u2019ve just lost all access to my most powerful tool for treating obesity medically with almost every one of my payers,\u201d she said. \u201cHow does that make sense?\u201d",
      "The length of time she sees patients take the drugs varies, but some may have to take it indefinitely to suppress food cravings. She said the state employee pilot program took a responsible approach by requiring that patients be prescribed the medications through obesity specialists, giving them counseling on diet, exercise and side effect management.",
      "\u201cThey already invested millions of dollars in these people,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s financially wasteful to throw it away, have these people regain their weight, get their health problems back, and we don\u2019t actually get to see the full potential of this pilot project.\"",
      "Dr. Bisher Mustafa of the Marshall Health Obesity Clinic in Huntington said there's a certain irony to waiting \"until people have diabetes to start the medication.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try to prevent diabetes from happening from the beginning,\u201d he said.",
      "PEIA Director Brian Cunningham said GLP-1s, which the state began offering for weight loss in 2019, cost the program around $53 million last fiscal year \u2014 about 20% of what PEIA spends on drugs.",
      "The cost of the GLP-1s was cited as a reason for 14% premium hikes for state employees, as well as a 16% increase for county employees and a 12% bump in costs for retirees. Increases will go into effect in July, according to the insurance agency, which covers 150,000 government workers, 56,000 retirees and their dependents.",
      "That's frustrated some PEIA members who feel they are unfairly shouldering the cost burden for a medication they don't use. Ashley Peggs, a Kanawha County teacher who doesn't use GLP-1 drugs, said her heart sank when she saw how much the plan was spending on the medicines during a public hearing about the proposed premium increases.",
      "She said the agency had just denied coverage for a spinal procedure for a condition threatening her ability to walk.",
      "\"So somebody else being skinny is more important than the fact that I literally may not be able to continue teaching until I retire without a wheelchair?\" said Peggs, 35, at the public hearing.",
      "Some taking the drugs for diabetes \u2014 like the vast majority of state employees on GLP-1s \u2014 expressed frustration that they haven't even been able to access Ozempic consistently because of shortages.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be cheaper: pay for that medication or for me to lose a leg to gangrene like my grandmother did?\u201d said Michael Kimball, 42, who takes the drug for diabetes. \u201cYear after year, the burden is put on the back of the working man and we\u2019re getting a little tired of it.\"",
      "Osborn described Wegovy as a breakthrough recommended by her provider after she'd tried for years to lose weight any way she could. She's also been able to halve the amount of rheumatoid arthritis medication she takes and she's seen back pain and her sciatica almost eradicated.",
      "She said dropping coverage for obesity patients feels like \u201cweight-based discrimination\u201d because other chronic diseases qualify. Osborn said she'll try purchasing versions of the medications that aren't approved by the FDA through compounding pharmacies. Doing so will increase her cost to around $300 per month. PEIA had provided her with a three-month supply for $50.",
      "\u201cI think that they need to realize that obesity is a disease \u2014 it's not a willpower, gutting-it-out choice,\" she said. \"It is a disease that you suffer from just like any other disease that you cannot prevent.\u201d"

      "Joseph Lynskey, 45, was standing on the platform in the West 18th Street station in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Tuesday afternoon when another man pushed him onto the tracks as a 1 train approached. Police called it a random attack.",
      "Lynskey's condition has been upgraded from critical to stable, police said.",
      "Christopher Lynskey, told The Daily News that his brother's injuries include a skull fracture and broken ribs, but he is awake and talking at Bellevue Hospital.",
      "\"He's good,\" said Christopher Lynskey, who flew in from Florida to see his brother. \u201cHe's busted up a little bit, but he's going to make a full recovery.\u201d",
      "A police department statement said responding officers were told Lynskey was struck by the train. Authorities did not say how Lynskey escaped with just broken bones.",
      "While a direct hit with a train is often fatal, some who fall from New York City\u2019s platforms do manage to survive. Safety experts say if it\u2019s not possible to get back on a platform or outrun a slowing train, lying down in the trough between the tracks may work in some stations, and there might be a space between the train and the platform at some stops.",
      "Kamel Hawkins, 23, was taken into custody later that day and made his initial court appearance in Manhattan Wednesday, when a judge approved a request by prosecutors to detain the Brooklyn resident without bail pending his next court appearance on Monday.",
      "Hawkins already had pending assault and harassment charges in Brooklyn, where he is accused of throwing bleach on a woman and trying to break into her home after threatening her, according to prosecutors.",
      "Hawkins' lawyer in the subway case, Darryl Hairston, did not immediately return a phone message Thursday. His lawyer in the Brooklyn case, Jeremy Gross, said he had no immediate comment.",
      "Hawkins' father, Shamel Spencer, told The New York Times that he's stunned by the allegations. He said Hawkins had some troubles with the law, but he never thought his son would be charged with anything so violent.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad kid at all,\u201d Spencer said.",
      "The possibility of being pushed onto the tracks is a long-running nightmare for many New Yorkers. While it occurs rarely compared to the millions of rides each day, a push just this past March killed a person in East Harlem.",
      "In New York, personal safety in the subway is generally comparable to safety in the city as a whole. But life-threatening crimes such as stabbings and shoves spread alarm about the trains, which carried more than 1 billion riders in 2024.",
      "Police figures show major crimes on subways were down through November compared with the same period last year, but killings rose from five to nine.",

      "The aging computer dispatch system for the nation's largest sheriff's department remains out of commission",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The archaic computer dispatch system for the nation's largest sheriff's department remained out of commission on Thursday after crashing on New Year's Eve, forcing deputies to handle all calls by radio, authorities said.",
      "Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials first learned about the problem around 8 p.m. Tuesday, when deputies at several sheriff's stations were unable to log in to the mobile computers in their patrol cars, the department said in a statement.",
      "The department said its computer-aided dispatch program \u2014 known as the CAD \u2014 was \u201cnot allowing personnel to log on with the new year, making the CAD inoperable.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a result, the Department is currently operating on self-dispatch while the issue is being addressed. Calls for service are still being responded to and are being manually tracked at the station level,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Service remains uninterrupted and radio communications and 911 lines are fully operational, officials said.",
      "It wasn't clear Thursday what caused the problem or how long it will take to fix. Department officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email inquiring if there\u2019s any indication the outage resulted from a malicious attack.",
      "The department has faced challenges with outdated technology for years. Since taking office in December 2022, Sheriff Robert Luna has \u201cemphasized the urgent need to improve and upgrade our internal systems.\u201d In mid-2023, the department formally requested proposals to acquire a new, centralized CAD system. This week's statements haven't said where the modernization effort stands.",
      "On Wednesday, ex-Sheriff Alex Villanueva posted on the social media site X a 2022 letter to the L.A. County Board of Supervisors requesting funding for a new computer-aided dispatch system. The letter said the existing system was so old it couldn\u2019t comply with data collection requirements."

    "story": [
      "Tennessee prison officials say they won't publicly release the the state's latest manual for executing death row inmates",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Just days after Tennessee announced it had a new manual for executing death row inmates, the state's top prison officials said they aren't going to release the document to the public.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction last week told The Associated Press to file a public records request to obtain a copy of the latest execution manual, known as a protocol. However, the agency this week denied the AP's request, saying it needs to keep the entire document secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved.",
      "The decision to maintain secrecy differs from how the state has handled similar requests in the past, but mirrors efforts across the U.S. to suppress public access surrounding executions, especially after anti-death penalty activists used records to expose problems.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "The protocol is typically a detailed set of procedures describing how the state executes death row inmates. Tennessee had been operating under a 2018 protocol that included directions on selecting execution team staff and the training they should undergo. It explained how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. It gave instructions on the inmate's housing, diet and visitation in the days leading up to execution. It provided directions on how to choose media witnesses.",
      "For lethal injection, the 2018 protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence.",
      "The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. But that is all that is known about the revised protocol.",
      "In an email sent Monday, Tennessee correction spokesperson Kayla Hackney told the AP the \u201cprotocol is not a public record\" and cited a Tennessee statute that makes the identities of the people carrying out executions confidential.",
      "However, that same statute says the existence of confidential information in a record is not a reason to deny access to it, noting that the confidential information should be redacted.",
      "In 2018, Tennessee's correction agency provided a redacted copy of the protocol to an AP reporter over email.",
      "In 2007, a previous version of the protocol was treated as a public record and provided to the AP after former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, announced a surprise halt to executions. A reporter's review of that 100-page \u201cManual of Execution\u201d found a jumble of conflicting instructions that mixed new lethal-injection instructions with those for electrocution.",
      "Executions have been on hold in Tennessee since 2022, when the state admitted it had not been following the 2018 protocol. Among other things, the Correction Department was not consistently testing the execution drugs for potency and purity.",
      "An independent review of the state\u2019s lethal injection practice later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested. Later, the state Attorney General\u2019s Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee\u2019s lethal injection drugs \u201cincorrectly testified\u201d under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required.",
      "Executions in the U.S. have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections.",
      "Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams and some courts have criticized such arguments for lack of evidence that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials.",
      "Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender\u2019s habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee\u2019s death row inmates, described the state's refusal to release the new protocol, given that background, as \u201cmystifying.\"",
      "\u201cThe secrecy, which cloaked the former execution protocol, created a culture of incompetence and lack of accountability,\u201d she said in an email."

      "The FBI now says that the pickup truck driver responsible for a deadly rampage in New Orleans acted alone",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The Army veteran who drove a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year\u2019s revelers in New Orleans acted alone, the FBI said Thursday, reversing its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others in the deadly attack that officials said was inspired by the Islamic State group.",
      "The FBI also revealed that the driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an American citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in the hours before the attack in which he proclaimed his support for the militant group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the famed French Quarter district.",
      "\u201cThis was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,\u201d said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, calling Jabbar \u201c100% inspired\u201d by the Islamic State.",
      "The attack along Bourbon Street killed 14 revelers, along with Jabbar, 42, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and plowing into the crowd. About 30 people were injured.",
      "It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat. It also comes as the FBI and other agencies brace for dramatic leadership upheaval \u2014 and likely policy changes \u2014 after President-elect Donald Trump's administration takes office.",
      "Raia stressed that there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck filled with explosives outside Trump\u2019s Las Vegas hotel. The person inside that truck, a decorated U.S. Army Green Beret, shot himself in the head just before detonation, authorities said.",
      "The FBI continued to hunt for clues about Jabbar but said that a day into its investigation, it was confident he was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others.",
      "The attack plans also included the placement of crude bombs in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage, officials said. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional.",
      "Officials reviewed surveillance video showing people standing near one of the coolers but concluded that they were not connected \u201cin any way\" with the attack, though investigators still want to speak with them as witnesses, Raia said.",
      "Investigators were also trying to understand more about Jabbar's path to radicalization, which they say culminated with him picking up a rented truck in Houston on Dec. 30 and driving it to New Orleans the following night.",
      "The FBI recovered a black Islamic State flag from his rented pickup and reviewed five videos posted to Facebook, including one in which he said he originally planned to harm his family and friends but \"was concerned that news headlines would not focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers,\u201d Raia said. Jabbar also stated that he joined IS before last summer, and he provided a last will and testament, the FBI said.",
      "Jabbar joined the Army in 2007, serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.",
      "A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly, said Jabbar traveled to Egypt in 2023, staying in Cairo for a week, before returning to the U.S. and then traveling to Toronto for three days. It was not immediately clear what he did during those travels.",
      "Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, Jabbar's younger brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel real\u201d that his brother could have done this.",
      "\u201cI never would have thought it\u2019d be him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unlike him.\u201d",
      "He said that his brother had been isolated in the last few years, but that he had also been in touch with him recently and had not seen any signs of radicalization.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely contradictory to who he was and how his family and his friends know him,\u201d he said.",
      "Chris Pousson, of Beaumont, Texas, said he became friends with Shamsud-Din Jabbar in middle school, describing him as someone who was quiet and reserved and did not get into trouble.",
      "After high school, he said, they reconnected on Facebook around 2008 or 2009 and would message back and forth throughout the next decade.",
      "\u201cIf any red flags would have popped off, I would have caught them, and I would have contacted the proper authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t give anything to me that would have suggested that he is capable of doing what happened.\u201d",

      "\u201cBodies, bodies all up and down the street, everybody screaming and hollering\u201d Parsons said. \u201cPeople crying on the floor, like brain matter all over the ground. It was just insane, like the closest thing to a war zone that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Dedeaux was a responsible daughter -- shorter than all her siblings but the one who helped take care of everyone, Parsons said. Dedeaux had a job at a hospital and was set to start college and begin working towards her goal of becoming a registered nurse.",

      "\u201cHe might be the first Tiger to ever play for us, and that nickname kind of described him as a competitor,\u201d Surace told ESPN. The school\u2019s nickname is the Tigers. \u201cHe was somebody that somehow, like in the key moments, just excelled and was full of energy, full of life.\u201d",

Usher confirmed Perez\u2019s death through her sister, who also works for her.",
      "Usher said Perez would walk in the morning to the deli, which opened at breakfast time, and would ask lots of questions about the business side of the operations. She also was permitted to bring her son, Melo, to work, where during breaks she taught him basic learning skills.",
      "\u201cShe was a really good mom,\u201d said Usher, who started a GoFundMe account to cover Perez\u2019s burial costs and to help with expenses for her son that \u201che will need to transition into a new living situation,\u201d the donation request says.",

      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",

      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",

      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",

      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

      "The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months, external by the energy regulator Ofgem.",

      "Between 1 January and 31 March 2025, gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh., external",

      "Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says that high domestic energy prices are likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",
      "What is a typical household?",

    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "\"We've had multiple young people say \"natural family planning\" is their main form of contraception,\" said Ms Peart, adding that the lack of positive role models and influencers was a challenge for those providing sex education.",
      "The YMCA sessions at schools, colleges and youth services attempt to inform, bust myths, discuss healthy relationships, but also hammer home the message that pregnancy is not the only risk.",
      "\"It's such a difficult barrier convincing young people that birth control isn't enough, and that you do need to protect yourself from STIs (sexually transmitted infections).\"",
      "She added they would also explain that \"natural family planning\" was not always reliable, \"especially at that age when maybe periods aren't regular and young people don't tend to be the most strict with keeping notes\".",
      "\"Our sessions also cover pornography and OnlyFans does sometimes come up as a strand of that.",
      "\"We try to educate young people to make their own healthy choices - and hopefully that includes not opening an OnlyFans account, but we can only provide the education.\"",
      "When BBC Wales asked young people for their thoughts, while many were too uncomfortable to speak publicly, most said buying condoms was seen as  too embarrassing.",
      "Liz Vieira, 20, from Llandysul, Ceredigion, said the decline in use of condoms - reported by the World Health Organization - did not surprise her given the prominence of adult content creators and their attitudes towards risk.",
      "\"I guess it's up to them, but as long as it's not meaning women in relationships are having a hard time. Because it sends a message it's OK to use women as you please. I don't think that's a good thing,\" she said.",

      "\"There's more of that content online now [porn] so you can easily access it at a young age, which might influence how young people feel about condoms,\" said Mason.",
      "The sessions delivered by YMCA for young people include information on the C-Card scheme, which is a supported service across the UK, providing training on sexual health awareness, as well as free condoms, lubrication and dental dams.",
      "\"Condoms are really expensive, so it's a fantastic service to make them accessible, but also acceptable, and not some weird, dark hidden corner of the pub toilets,\" said Ms Peart.",
      "She is aware of fears the scheme could be seen as encouraging under-age sex but said research suggested more information at a younger age was likely to delay that.",
      "\"We try and persuade them to wait until they're at least 16. But if they are going to, then we can make sure they can do it in a safe way.\"",
      "The World Health Organization recently reported that 56% of 15-year-old girls in Wales, and 49% of boys, had not used a condom the last time they had sex.",
      "It comes amid a rise in STIs in the past year: 22% in chlamydia, 127% in gonorrhoea, and 14% in syphilis.",
      "Ellie Whelan and Megan Grimley, both 21, from Cardiff, said the move away from condoms surprised them given more of their peers had turned away from the pill or coil as forms of contraception.",
      "Use of long-acting, reversible contraception - such as an intra-uterine device (IUD) or hormonal implant - has fallen 22% in the last five years, with terminations up by a third.",

      "Testing is the best way to find out if you have a sexually transmitted infection.",
      "The Sexual Health Wales service offers a free test kit for over-16s which can be sent and returned by post or collected from community venues.",
      "Sexual health clinics across Wales also provide testing and support.",

      "HIV takes seven weeks to be detected, hepatitis C and B can take 12 weeks or more, and chlamydia and gonorrhoea can show up within a fortnight.",

    "summary": "James Hunt says he will never regret becoming a full-time carer to his two autistic sons.",
    "story": [
      "James Hunt used to spend his days commuting to London, where he ran a successful marketing firm.",
      "But his children Jude and Tommy were diagnosed as autistic when they were toddlers, and he later decided to care for them and his parents full-time.",
      "James, from Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, started blogging about their lives nine years ago and now has more than a million followers on social media.",
      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",
      "It's opposite my ex-wife's home and I have one of the boys for several nights a week and then we swap over, and I have the other one. They both need one-to-one care and it's impossible for them to live together.",
      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",
      "Jude is now 16 and loves music so we go on long car drives listening to the radio. It's one of the few places where he feels safe and can relax.",
      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",
      "It's somewhere for people in the community to visit, we have a sensory room in the shop and we get lots of parents coming in who want to have a chat.",
      "Everyone working in the shop is a parent, carer or is autistic, so they can share their experiences with customers.",
      "'I've learned to cherish the simple things'",
      "I always try to focus on the positives and not think too far ahead but there are days when my mind runs away with me.",
      "It will be a huge challenge when the boys leave school when they are 19.",
      "That's massively scary because suddenly you have to trust a whole new bunch of people.",
      "There is a part-time college I hope they can go to but it's a huge unknown and there will be big decisions to make.",
      "You feel like you have to live forever to look after them, and that is the biggest fear for many parents.",
      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",
      "It has taught me to cherish and enjoy the simple things and I just want the boys to be happy.",
      "Looking back at how I felt when they were diagnosed, I would like to tell myself it's all going to be OK.",
      "Those first few years can be a really scary and emotional time. You feel like you have no idea what you're doing.",
      "Don't bottle everything up, find people to open up to. Your friends and family want to help, they just don't know how to yet.",
      "You will go through the most challenging and difficult days of your life but you will learn so much from your boys and your love for them will get you through.",

    "story": [
      "From superhero blockbusters to Netflix romantic comedies, Scotland has become an increasingly familiar location for Hollywood to use.",
      "In the autumn, Twisters star Glen Powell could be seen in Glasgow shooting scenes for sci-fi tale The Running Man, while Edinburgh and Aberdeenshire will be the backdrop for a new version of Frankenstein.",
      "Those productions join a lengthy list of films and TV shows filmed in the country over the past decade.",
      "Tourism bosses hope successful productions can see Scotland follow the likes of New Zealand - where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films were shot - and Northern Ireland, which saw a tourism upswing from Game of Thrones fans looking to visit locations used in the fantasy series.",
      "Why does Hollywood like Scotland for filming?",
      "For some films, such as Orkney-set drama The Outrun or smash-hit TV show Outlander, filming on location in Scotland is a natural option given the stories themselves are set there.",
      "Scottish scenery and wilderness is distinctive, and can mostly be accessed relatively quickly from major cities, which helps.",
      "However, the past decade has seen cities across the country stand in for other places - something Ray Tallan, the head of film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, suggests is down to architecture cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh.",
      "He says it \"lends itself beautifully\" to the big screen.",
      "Mr Tallan also points to the increase in studio provision in the country, with the likes of First Stage Studios in Leith and Wardpark Film and Television Studios in Cumbernauld.",
      "Mr Tallan told BBC Scotland News:  \"This gives productions the flexibility to not just use Scotland for its scenery but now also its studio facilities.",
      "\"As more of these productions shoot here successfully, this provides confidence in the sector and an increase in reputation.\"",
      "There is another reason too - money.",
      "Like the rest of the UK, Scotland is able to offer tax breaks to productions, which adds to its appeal, as well as additional funding.",
      "For example, Glasgow City Council gave Warner Bros around \u00a3150,000 to shoot DC Comics film Batgirl in the city - only for the finished movie to never see the light of day after bosses at the studio decided not to release it.",
      "What locations can Scottish cities double as?",
      "Glasgow has been particularly adaptable, with its streets doubling for London in the  Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, as legendary comic book location Gotham City in the opening of comic book adventure The Flash, and as 1960s New York for a parade scene in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.",
      "Cheryl Conway, the head of Screen Commission at Screen Scotland, told BBC Scotland News the country has \"versatility\", which makes it appeal to studios.",
      "Of course, this can work the other way too: cheesy festive romcom A Merry Scottish Christmas used Duns Castle in the Scottish Borders for exterior shots, but nearly the entire film was, despite the title, filmed in Ireland.",

      "Does Scotland's economy benefit from filming?",
      "This is a more complicated issue.",
      "A regular concern when massive productions take over parts of the city is whether the disruption negatively hits local businesses.",
      "When the Batgirl film was axed, Glasgow City Council told the Daily Record that the production still provided \"a very significant economic benefit\" for the wider city.",
      "However, businesses in areas where filming occurred were less convinced, telling the BBC at the time that their trade had been adversely affected.",
      "The Social Recluse clothing shop on King Street in the Trongate area was given \u00a31,000 in compensation after having to close for 10 days for filming - something staff said didn't make up for a \"wasted month\".",
      "Other productions, such as Indiana Jones and the Running Man remake, have seen swathes of Glasgow altered and streets and roads blocked off, raising the question of whether those being directly affected are actually seeing any benefits.",
      "Dr Ewelina Lacka, of the Business School at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland News that economic benefits of films in Scotland were a \"mixed perspective\", particularly in regards to tourism.",
      "She explained: \"It's not only the film being made there but whether certain conditions are met, mainly related to destination management and marketing.",
      "\"It highlights the importance of something like Visit Scotland, in having a marketing strategy implemented before and after filming.\"",
      "What is the Outlander effect on Scottish tourism?",
      "The clearest example of a film or TV production boosting Scotland is Outlander, the hugely popular TV show based on books by American author Diana Gabaldon.",
      "Several companies now offer Outlander tours around Scotland, visiting locations used throughout the long-running series.",
      "Dr Lacka said: \"It's a diversion effect \u2013 people plan trips, and work in the filming locations as part of a wider visit.\"",
      "Mr Tallan agrees, saying: \"Outlander has an amazing reach globally and there is no doubt it has had an impact on tourism at locations where the production is shot.\"",
      "Does the homegrown Scottish film industry benefit from Hollywood productions?",
      "Screen Scotland believes the local film industry gains advantages from visiting big productions.",
      "Ms Conway said it enabled trainees and Scottish crews to gain \"vital experience\" and help secure \"sustainable careers\" in the long term.",
      "Mr Tallan agrees, saying more experienced crew members can move onto big productions, which in turn \"gives that opportunity for new blood to come in\" on smaller shoots.",
      "Where will we see Scotland on screen next?",
      "Glasgow was recently taken over for The Running Man, based on Stephen King's book and already adapted once in a 1980s action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "This time Glen Powell is the man forced to fight to survive on a ruthless game show, with Glasgow portraying a dystopian, futuristic city.",
      "Edinburgh and Aberdeenshire will be stepping in for 18th Century Germany in a new version of Gothic horror Frankenstein for streaming giant Netflix, directed by Guillermo Del Toro.",

    "story": [
      "Later this month, two multiplex cinemas within 20 miles of each other will close down.",
      "But while one of them will get a new lease of life with a new operator, one will be demolished to be replaced by a storage site.",
      "What is happening in Northampton and Kettering is symptomatic of cinema closures across the UK, but there are also new sites and operators opening.",
      "So what is the state of play within the cinema industry?",
      "What cinemas have been closing?",
      "The Point in Milton Keynes was one of the UK's first multiplex cinemas when it opened in 1985. The site showed its last film in 2015, and last year it was saved from demolition.",
      "The city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.",
      "But during the pandemic, cinema chains began to suffer as screens were closed for several months. When they reopened, there were drops in both the number of films and audiences.",
      "In 2023, both Empire Cinemas and Cineworld went into administration.",
      "Irish chain Omniplex bought five of the Empire Cinema sites. It then announced it would close the cinema in Ipswich, but that decision was later reversed.",
      "Cineworld was unable to find a buyer and instead last year announced that a number of sites would close, including in Bedford.",
      "Last month the company announced a further six sites would close \u2013 including in Northampton \u2013 and said it would pull out of a leisure centre in Colchester.",
      "The site in Northampton will be converted into an Odeon. That operator also recently opened a site in Peterborough.",
      "But the Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month after the landlord said it was no longer viable.",
      "Why have cinemas been closing?",
      "Despite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.",
      "\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.",
      "\"The recovery has completely stalled and that is to do with the release calendar, which was impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\"",
      "In 2023, both writers and actors in the United States took industrial action, which halted the production of several major films and delayed their release.",
      "\"We haven't had consistent releases of big tentpole films until we got to November,\" says Mr Gant.",
      "Richard Clifford, programmer at the two-screen Northampton Filmhouse, agrees and says 2024 was \"a challenging year in general for the industry\".",
      "He says the November releases of Gladiator II, Wicked, and Paddington in Peru \"certainly helped every cinema around the world\".",
      "Mr Clifford, who has also worked for Cineworld and Vue, adds that audiences \"haven't seen the wider range of films\" with fewer documentaries, British films and foreign films released.",
      "Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"",
      "Some of those will be reopened by other operators, he says, \"but inevitably it will mean that some communities lose their local cinema, [which] really does have an impact\".",
      "Is smaller the future?",
      "Mr Gant says cinemas face rising costs as many industries do, in particular with energy and staffing.",
      "\"They are large buildings and some of them are probably not built in the most energy-efficient manner,\" he says.",
      "\"Some of the stuff that got built in the 1990s are these of out-of-town sheds.\"",
      "But new cinemas are opening and Mr Clapp says operators recognise they need to \"offer something more than people would get at home\".",
      "\"The general trend is to more reclining sofas [and] a more upscale experience, and part of that is a move away from the large auditoriums with hundreds of seats,\" he says.",
      "He adds that rather than looking only at capacity, cinemas want to increase occupancy or, \"put simply, bums on seats\".",
      "\"That's the general direction of travel for many in the UK cinema sector and indeed in European and global cinemas,\" he says.",
      "But he adds: \"There is an audience out there still for the big-screen experience.\"",
      "Mr Clifford says a smaller venue such as Northampton Filmhouse \u2013 which has two screens, each with a capacity of about 90 \u2013 can have \"a different kind of audience that comes on a regular basis\".",
      "\"They come here so regularly. They come and see everything we put on,\" he says.",
      "Will 2025 be better for cinemas?",
      "Mr Clapp says 2025 looks \"something like the normal film slate\" for large studio films.",
      "\"What still needs to build back is the next tier and more diverse films \u2013 the films that appeal to a broader audience than [the] mainstream blockbusters,\" he says.",
      "He adds that his members \"from the large multiplexes down to the smaller, independent cinemas\" are confident about both this year and next year.",
      "Mr Clifford agrees, saying that 2025's \"line-up is stellar compared with [2024]\".",

    "summary": "The show has returned to our screens for a third series, but with a few key changes to the format.",
    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",
      "Format changes",
      "Several tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.",
      "One early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness.",
      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:46:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Willem Dafoe reflects on the appeal of Dracula: \"It's interesting to have the undead visit the living\".",
    "story": [
      "When I meet Willem Dafoe on Zoom to discuss his latest movie Nosferatu, we get on to mortality fast.",
      "The four-time Oscar-nominated actor is talking to me for Radio 4's Today programme about Robert Eggers' remake of the 1922 silent film of the same name, which was an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.",
      "Nosferatu is the tale of a terrifying vampire who is infatuated with a haunted young woman called Ellen, played by Lily-Rose Depp.",
      "The story that unfolds involves a lot of death. Where creatures that feed on human blood are concerned, that's pretty standard. But Dafoe, who plays a vampire-hunting professor of the occult in the film, tells me in real life too \"we're all somewhere considering death all the time\".",
      "For him, that's one explanation for the popularity of vampire stories.",
      "Bram Stoker's novel Dracula has been adapted numerous times, and vampires in general are never far from our screens.",
      "Dafoe rationalises the enduring appeal of the subgenre like this: \"It's a very interesting proposition to have the undead visit the living, and it becomes something of a meditation of the dark side of things versus the light\".",
      "Even if we don't know it, he muses, all of us are always addressing this type of conflict in some form.",
      "An interview with Dafoe is never dull; he's a thoughtful and intelligent actor, who, for the best part of 50 years, has combined big Hollywood successes (Spiderman movies, John Wick, Born on the Fourth of July) with the arthouse films he relishes.",
      "He dropped out of university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to join an experimental theatre company but, since those early days, his voracious work ethic and intense appeal as perhaps the greatest living character actor have seen him in more than 130 films. His debut, Heaven's Gate, was in 1980. Seven years later, he was first nominated for an Oscar for the Vietnam war film Platoon.",
      "Dafoe was crucified as Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ and cut off his ear as Van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate. He spent six hours a day in the prosthetics make-up chair to morph into a reclusive scientist in Poor Things, and he has even been a version of a vampire himself, in Shadow of the Vampire.",
      "While the original 1922 silent movie by F.W. Murnau pioneered some early special effects, including superimposing the image of Nosferatu on to a ship to create a frightening ghostly glow, Eggers goes for an earthy take, grounded in history and reality.",
      "There were 2,000 real live rats on set.",
      "It's perfect for Dafoe, who tells me he doesn't like to work too much with computer-generated imagery (the green screen and other visual effects that have become integral to filmmaking).",
      "\"You need to earn the authority to pretend, and through the technology, that gets lost\".",
      "Don't expect well-trodden vampire movie fare in this Nosferatu. Count Orlok doesn't have the symmetrical fanged teeth we're used to. This vampire isn't a suave seducer in a high-collared black cloak.",
      "Dafoe says Eggers wanted to get back to \"a time when people actually believed in vampires\". To do this, \"he went for a much more folk-based vampire\".",
      "The actor believes this is \"why this Orlok in the movie is so very different to anything we've ever seen before\".",
      "The film is packed with talent popular with Gen Z (Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin). The cast - and the status of the 1922 original in the film firmament - means Eggers' movie had achieved a cult-like following even before its release.",
      "In the US, that was on Christmas Day. I asked whether Dafoe thought a movie about a bloodsucking, diseased creature and the horror he unleashes on a 19th Century German town was the perfect antidote to a day of family festivities.",
      "He pointed to \"the shadow side\" of these occasions, \"a time when some people fall into depression because they fall out of that happiness\".",
      "It's true that his film work offers up both sides - the joy and the pain of life, the extremes of being human and everything in-between.",
      "He tells me that if you don't recognise there is a shadow side to life, \"you're going to become a victim of it some day\".",
      "As I look at him on the computer screen, it's impossible not to reflect on how expressive his face is - a face that could be carved from the earth.",
      "He tells me he only realised it when he started being photographed on the red carpet.",
      "\"Man, they get some ugly pictures of me. They get some grotesque pictures and they get some nice pictures\".",
      "He puts that down to his face having \"range\".",
      "\"I never think about my face,\" he goes on. \"If I ever do, it's really just to tell it to calm down\".",
      "Nosferatu is released in the UK on 1 January 2025.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The pair were married for two years - but it has taken four times that time to reach a divorce deal.",
    "story": [
      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",
      "One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by  bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.",
      "Some of that still needs to be resolved in what Jolie's lawyer has called \"a long ongoing process\".",
      "Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.",
      "\"This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,\" he said.",
      "\"But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.\"",
      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",
      "\"It's an inability to let go and a desire to really harm the other.\"",
      "Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.",
      "\"It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers,\" she said. \"Most people couldn't afford for it to take eight years. It's an industry and it's a bad example - we have to distance [normal] people from that kind of narrative.\"",
      "Romantic beginning",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, got together after meeting on the set of the film Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005.",
      "\"Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened,\" Jolie told Vogue in 2007.",
      "Both had been married before - Pitt to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie to actors Jonny Lee Miller (1996 to 2000) and Billy Bob Thornton (2000 to 2003).",
      "Jolie and Pitt share six children together.",
      "Jolie adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 a few months after he was born. Pitt later adopted him after he and Jolie had begun their relationship.",
      "In 2005, the pair adopted daughter Zahara from Ethiopia when she was a few months old.",
      "The couple's first biological child, Shiloh, was born in Namibia in 2006. Earlier this year, it was reported that Shiloh had submitted a petition to a court to drop Pitt from her name.",
      "Their son Pax was adopted at the age of three from Vietnam in 2007, and twins Knox and Vivienne were born in 2008.",
      "Beginning of the end",
      "The couple made their final red carpet appearance together in November 2015 for a film they both starred in, By the Sea. It was about an unhappily married couple, and was written and directed by Jolie.",
      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",
      "At the time, a source close to the actor told the BBC that her claims were false.",
      "Speaking to Vogue in 2020, Jolie said she left Pitt for the \"wellbeing\" of her family.",
      "\"It was the right decision,\" she said. \"I continue to focus on their healing.\"",
      "In an interview with GQ in 2017, Pitt spoke about his decision to quit drinking and smoking marijuana, saying the split had been a \"huge generator for change\".",
      "Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon a path of \"vitriolic hatred\" and work together to sort out their issues, adding that they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.",
      "Custody battle",
      "Their attempts to reach agreements over the divorce and custody of their children appeared to be acrimonious and protracted.",
      "In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalised.",
      "They reached a custody deal in 2018, but that appeared to fall apart. In 2021, Pitt was granted joint custody after a court battle, but the private judge who oversaw the case was later removed because he did not disclose his business relationships with Pitt's lawyers.",
      "That raised the prospect of a fresh custody case, but nothing has been made public.",
      "And while the divorce saga may now be drawing to a close, there is another legal battle still ongoing - to do with the vineyard.",
      "Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval together in 2008 and got married in its small chapel in 2014.",
      "But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to Pitt's lawsuit. He is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the estate, saying they agreed not to sell their shares without the permission of the other. Jolie has not publicly commented.",
      "Emotional fallout",
      "Few details of the divorce proceedings have been revealed. Private judges are often hired in the US to mediate disputes between divorcing celebrities for privacy reasons.",
      "Their children are now all aged between 16 and 23, and showbiz journalist Jeanne Wolf emphasised the emotional fallout.",

    "story": [
      "Johnnie Walker's long radio career was shaped by his early years as a pirate broadcaster in the 1960s, bobbing around on the ocean on Radio Caroline.",
      "Even 50 years later, his wife Tiggy would refer to him as \"the pirate\".",
      "It remained more than apt, given that his subsequent time on mainstream radio was marked by more than a few battles with the bosses.",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Rebel spirit",
      "His DJ career began at the age of 21, when he was first given a chance to play records on 'Swinging' Radio England, a boat moored four miles off the Essex coast.",
      "In return, they asked that he change his name - from Peter Dingley to the rather more rock 'n' roll-sounding Johnnie Walker.",
      "The boat was one of a number of floating stations that had taken advantage of a loophole in the law that allowed them to get round the BBC's monopoly on the UK airwaves to bring the sound of 60s pop to the nation's radios - something the BBC had up to that point largely resisted.",
      "Walker took to the rebel spirit. His years at public school had fostered a loathing of authority, and he had gone out of his way to fail his O-levels. Radio allowed him to embrace his passion - music - especially the rock, soul and underground sounds that were not making it to the top of the singles chart.",
      "Occasionally, he would row across to another boat, Radio London, to chat to a kindred spirit, a young DJ who was beginning to make a name for himself, John Peel.",
      "It wasn't tea he was talking about",
      "Walker then moved to the pirate mothership, Radio Caroline.",
      "His style was laid back, conversational and a contrast to the highly formatted slick patter of many other DJs.",
      "That attitude may have had something to do with his favoured means of relaxation on board. He even had an on-air code - he said the boat was running short of tea to signal that they were running out of his preferred type of herbal cigarette.",
      "His time on board also coincided with the government\u2019s decision to crack down on the pirates. Walker was on air at midnight of 14 August 1967, when the law making the pirates illegal came in to force.",
      "He read out a defiant speech declaring: \"We belong to you and we love you.\" His reputation as a symbol of the spirit of the pirates was assured.",
      "Undone by the Bay City Rollers",
      "However, in 1969 he switched sides and joined the establishment, BBC Radio One. It was not the easiest of relationships.",
      "He was, he said, accused of being \"too into the music\". He would pepper his shows with album tracks and songs outside the approved playlist.",
      "When he championed Walk on the Wild Side, Lou Reed\u2019s song about sex, drugs and transgender bohemia, his BBC boss had questions. It only stayed on the playlist because they had never encountered the phrase \"giving head\".",
      "Walker also loved Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles; Chirpy, Chirpy Cheep, Cheep, not so much.",
      "The cheery, cheeky sound of 70s mainstream radio was not his thing. At one Radio One event, he and Peel remembered watching, stunned, as fans of the Bay City Rollers brought chaos.",
      "\"Bay City Roller fans were jumping into the lake to be near their idols who were in a boat. John Peel turned to me and said, 'Johnnie, take note, this is one of the most bizarre sights you will ever see'.",
      "\"And then speeding into view came Tony Blackburn in another boat, being steered by a Womble.\"",
      "Cocaine, court and punk rock",
      "Not long after that, he parted company with Radio One after describing the Bay City Rollers as \"musical garbage\". He decided to leave for the freedom of US radio. It had its ups and downs.",
      "KSAN in San Francisco, with its relaxed FM rock playlist, seemed a perfect match until punk came along. It was not to the manager's taste and Walker was soon looking for work elsewhere.",
      "His sideline of sending pre-recorded shows back to Radio Luxembourg also came to an end when he played a record at the wrong speed.",
      "By the early 80s, he was back in the UK and on the dole.",
      "His return to the airwaves included a spell in independent local radio before he returned to the BBC. He again came a cropper at BBC GLR after saying there would be dancing in the streets when Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister in 1990.",
      "But, despite the setbacks, he eventually found a home at Radio 2.",
      "However, that almost came to an end when the News of the World's infamous fake sheikh staged a sting in 1999 and got him to reveal his drug habit. It was, he said, his lowest point. But after a trip to rehab, a \u00a32,000 fine and a promise that he had changed his ways, he was allowed back on to Radio 2.",

      "On 22 December 2023, Saltburn was released on Amazon Prime. By 5 January 2024, Murder on the Dancefloor was back in the top 10 and would spend five weeks at number two, only kept off the top spot by Noah Kahan's Stick Season.",
      "\"The year started with an old friend Murder on the Dancefloor taking me for another twirl,\" is how she sums it up.",

      "Indeed, indie music is where Ellis-Bexter started out. She first made the charts in 1998 as lead singer of theaudience, a band who made up for their lack of capital letters and use of the space bar with a couple of rather catchy Smiths influenced post-Britpop top 40 hits.",

      "Payne died on 16 October after falling from a hotel balcony in the capital, Buenos Aires.",
      "Here's what we know so far about the police investigation and the circumstances surrounding Payne's death.",
      "Why was Liam in Argentina?",
      "Payne was visiting his former bandmate Niall Horan, who was in the country on tour.",
      "He posted on Snapchat earlier in October that he was visiting Horan for a catch-up, saying: \"It's been a while since me and Niall have spoken, we've got a lot to talk about.\" He added: \"No bad vibes or anything like that, but we need to talk.\"",

      "His final Snapchats from last few days in Argentina",
      "Payne attended Horan's show, posting social media videos of himself and girlfriend Kate Cassidy singing and dancing at the concert.",
      "He documented much of his trip on Snapchat, including pictures of food, plans to play polo, and jokes about his hair. We also know the pop star visited a friend's house in Argentina in the days before he died, again with Cassidy.",
      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "Payne's friend Roger Nores was at the hotel with him but left at 16:11 local time (20:11 BST) on 16 October, Argentine prosecutors have said.",
      "Payne was then in the hotel lobby and was unable to stand \"due to the consumption of various substances\", they said.",
      "At 16:54, cameras recorded him being dragged unconscious by three people - led by chief receptionist Esteban Grassi - and taken to his room, according to prosecutors.",
      "Grassi called emergency services at about 17:00, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",
      "\"I don't know if the guest's life is in danger. But he has a room with a balcony and we're a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,\" Grassi said in a second call.",

      "Read the full transcript of the hotel's emergency call",
      "Payne's room was on the third floor and had a balcony about 14m (45ft) above an interior courtyard.",
      "It is thought he fell from the balcony at about 17:07 local time.",
      "Police arrived minutes later. Hotel staff told them a loud sound had been heard in the courtyard, where Payne's body was discovered.",
      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "Police say they found his room in \"total disorder\". Local media later published pictures purportedly from his room, showing a TV with a broken screen, multiple bottles, cans, candles, aluminium foil and a half-full glass of champagne.",
      "What have official tests revealed?",
      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",
      "On 7 November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body.",
      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",
      "However, following a further forensic report and an inspection of the scene on 5 December, a judge said that, in his state of intoxication, Payne \"tried to leave the room through the balcony\" and fell to his death.",
      "The judge concluded that Payne tried to leave from the balcony because forensic experts had decided he did not pass out and lose his balance.",

      "Even if you were lucky enough to get a new console or games this Christmas, you've probably got your eye on some upcoming releases.",
      "And 2025 is shaping up to be a big one.",
      "Most agree that 2024 was a painful year for the games industry, with tens of thousands of layoffs and worldwide studio closures.",
      "There's a hope that things will bounce back - at least in part - next year.",
      "And two huge releases in particular are likely to cut through in a big way.",
      "Grand Theft Auto 6",
      "A cultural moment, a day millions of gamers have been awaiting for a very, very long time.",
      "The release of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).",
      "It's due to land in autumn, 12 years after predecessor GTA 5 arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, breaking launch records.",
      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",
      "Why is GTA 6 so important?",
      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",
      "A new Nintendo Switch?",
      "Here's what we know, officially, about Nintendo's next console.",
      "It exists.",
      "Your current Switch games will work on it.",
      "And that's it.",
      "There's no official name yet, but fans have been calling it the Nintendo Switch 2.",
      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",
      "\"That was a long time ago,\" he says. \"I think they've learned a lot of lessons since then.\"",
      "More breakout hits",
      "Some of 2024's biggest success stories came from small, independent developers.",
      "The most notable was Balatro - an addictive, poker-inspired card game that ended the year in the running for high-profile game of the year awards.",
      "Journalist Rachel Watts, who hosts the Indieventure podcast, feels that has helped to set the stage for more breakout success this year.",
      "\"There's been so many great indies this year,\" she says.",
      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",
      "\"If Balatro can knock elbows with some of the biggest titles of the year, then I'm hoping other other indies will.\"",

      "George says the esports Olympics will revive conversations about sportswashing - the idea that Saudi Arabia uses its vast wealth to invest in sports and entertainment to improve its international reputation - something it's denied.",
      "\"You have this really interesting thing,\" says George.",
      "\"Your big esports moment - esports becomes an Olympic sport.",

    "summary": "The wild success of K-entertainment - from pop hits to mushy dramas - has been in the making for years.",
    "story": [
      "Evan Barringer was 14 years old when he stumbled onto Full House, a South Korea romcom where two strangers are forced to share a house.",
      "Sitting in his house in Memphis, he hit play assuming it was an Asian remake of a beloved American sitcom from the 1980s. It wasn\u2019t until the third episode that he realised they had nothing in common save the name. But he was hooked.",
      "That accidental choice changed his life. Twelve years on, he is an English teacher in South Korea - and he says he loves it here: \u201cI have got to try all the foods I\u2019ve seen in K-dramas, and I\u2019ve gotten to see several of the K-pop artists in concerts whose lyrics I used to study Korean.\u201d",
      "When Evan discovered Full House in 2012, South Korean entertainment was a blip in the world\u2019s eye. Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style was the best-known Korean pop export at the time.",
      "Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that\u2019s four times the population of South Korea. Squid Game, Netflix's most popular show ever, has just returned for a much-anticipated second season.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The so-called Korean Wave swept the world, experts say, when the success of streaming met American-inspired production value. And Korean entertainment \u2013 from pop music and mushy dramas to acclaimed hits built around universal themes \u2013 was ready for it.",

      "As it turns out, this moment had been in the making for years.",
      "It's all in the timing",
      "After South Korea\u2019s military dictatorship ended in 1987, censorship was loosened and numerous TV channels launched. Soon, there was a generation of creators who had grown up idolising Hollywood and hip-hop, says Hye Seung Chung, associate professor of Korean Film Studies at the University of Buffalo.",
      "Around the same time, South Korea rapidly grew rich, benefitting from an export boom in cars and electronics. And money from conglomerates, or chaebols as they are known, flowed into film and TV production, giving it a Hollywood-like sheen.",
      "They came to own much of the industry, from production to cinemas. So they were willing to splurge on making movies without worrying much about losses, Prof Chung says.",
      "K-pop, meanwhile, had become a domestic rage in the mid-90s, propelling the success of groups such as HOT and Shinhwa.",
      "This inspired agencies to replicate the gruelling Japanese artist management system.",
      "Scout young talent, often in their teens, and sign them onto years-long contracts through which they become \u201cperfect\u201d idols, with squeaky clean images and hyper-managed public personas. As the system took hold, it transformed K-pop, creating more and more idols.",
      "By the 2000s, Korean TV shows and K-pop were a hit in East and South East Asia. But it was streaming that took them to the world, and into the lives of anyone with a smartphone.",
      "That\u2019s when the recommendation engine took over \u2013 it has been key in initiating Korean culture fans, taking them from one show to the next, spanning different genres and even platforms.",
      "The alien and the familiar",
      "Evan says he binged the 16 hour-long episodes of Full House. He loved the way it took its time to build the romance, from bickering banter to attraction, unlike the American shows he knew.",
      "\u201cI was fascinated by each cultural difference I saw - I noticed that they don\u2019t wear shoes in the house,\u201d he recalls. So he took up Netflix\u2019s suggestions for more Korean romcoms. Soon, he found himself humming to the soundtracks of the shows, and was drawn to K-pop.",
      "He has now begun watching variety shows, a reality TV genre where comedians go through a series of challenges together.",
      "As they work their way through the recommendations, fans are immersed in a world that feels foreign yet familiar \u2013 one that eventually includes kimchi jiggae, a spicy kimchi stew, and kalguksu, a seafood and kelp noodle broth.",

      "For Mary, food was a big part of the appeal because she saw such a variety of it on K-dramas. Seeing how characters build relationships over food was familiar to her, she says, because she grew up in the French countryside in Burgundy.",
      "But there is also the promise of romance, which drew Marie Namur to South Korea from her native Belgium. She began watching K-dramas on a whim, after visiting South Korea, but she says she kept going because she was \u201cpretty much attracted to all those beautiful Korean men\u201d.",

      "The pursuit of a global audience has brought challenges as well. The increasing use of English lyrics in K-pop has led to some criticism.",

    "summary": "The government announces first steps to creating a National Care Service - but the final report is several years away.",
    "story": [
      "Proposals on the long-term funding of adult social care in England are unlikely to be delivered before 2028 at the earliest, the government has confirmed.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", with an independent commission due to begin work in April.",
      "But the commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Councils and care providers say that is too long to wait for the reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\"' in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "\"Our ageing society, with costs of care set to double in the next 20 years, demands longer-term action,\" said Streeting.",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Writing in the Guardian on Friday, Streeting acknowledged Labour \"took a lot of flak\" for not providing much detail, but added: \"I was honest about the reason why - general election campaigns are where plans for social care go to die.\"",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "\"Millions of older people, disabled people, their families and carers rely upon an effective adult social care system to live their lives to the full with independence and dignity,\" said Baroness Casey.",
      "\"An independent commission is an opportunity to start a national conversation, find the solutions and build consensus on a long-term plan to fix the system.\"",
      "The King's Fund independent health think-tank urged the government to \"accelerate the timing\" of the commission.",
      "\"The current timetable to report by 2028 is far too long to wait for people who need social care, and their families,\" said its chief executive, Sarah Woolnough.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, agreed the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",
      "Helen Walker, the head of Carers UK, which represents millions of unpaid people who provide care to family members, said families were \"under intense pressure and providing more care than ever before\".",
      "Amanda Pritchard, NHS England chief executive, said: \"We hope this vital action plan and commitment to create a National Care Service will both help better support people and ease pressure on hospital wards.\"",
      "The government also confirmed an extra \u00a386m would be spent before the end of the financial year in April to help thousands more elderly and disabled people to remain in their homes.",
      "The money is on top of a similar sum announced in the Budget for the next financial year.",
      "Overall, it should allow 7,800 disabled and elderly people to make vital improvements to their homes which should increase their independence and reduce hospitalisations, says the government.",

      "\"Everything was a shock - I went from being so in control of my body to being so out of control,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "She had never really worried about her own fertility before. Conceiving Albie had been straightforward, and that pregnancy went smoothly. And thankfully, she would successfully give birth to another son, Monty, in July 2023.",
      "But - as Dame Laura began to talk publicly about her baby losses - other athletes told her they had been through the same thing.",
      "It has left a nagging question - could elite sport have a damaging impact on the fertility of female athletes?",
      "\"Was my body just running on empty, and then it said, 'Well, hang on, there's no way we can do this?'\" she says.",
      "Miscarriage is common. The NHS says one-in-eight known pregnancies end before 24 weeks and many occur at a very early stage. Most couples never find out why.",
      "But are athletes at greater risk of any type of fertility problem?",
      "Dr Emma O'Donnell, an exercise physiologist at Loughborough University, says the lifestyle of a professional athlete puts a unique strain on the human body.",
      "Elite training burns a phenomenal number of calories and, as a result, athletes' bodies are often lean and muscular, containing very little body fat.",
      "If they don't eat enough food to keep up with the calorie burn then issues with menstrual cycles, such as periods stopping for months or even years, are \"very common\", Dr O'Donnell says.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of female athletes experience interrupted periods, particularly in endurance sports. There are comparably high rates of periods disappearing in competitors in sports like gymnastics, ballet and figure skating. This compares to only 2-5% of the general population.",
      "Absent periods can be a sign that ovulation (or egg release) isn't happening.",
      "How does that happen in the body?",
      "\"We're not 100% sure,\" says Dr O'Donnell, but the leading idea is that having a baby is so energy-intensive that the brain shuts off reproduction if it thinks there is insufficient spare energy.",
      "It starts in the hypothalamus, a small structure in the centre of the brain that senses the nutritional state of the body.",
      "Sitting just underneath the hypothalamus is the body's hormone factory - the pituitary gland.",
      "Normally, the gland releases hormones that travel down to the womb and ovaries to control the monthly menstrual cycle and the release of an egg, which makes pregnancy possible.",
      "But if the hypothalamus isn't happy, this process breaks down and ovulation doesn't happen.",
      "\"If you're not ovulating you can't have a baby. You can't conceive because there's no egg being released,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "The biggest factor in this seems to be the huge number of calories burned while training, which can leave athletes struggling to eat enough food to compensate.",
      "This phenomenon is known as relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), and was first recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 2014.",
      "But other factors are also likely to be involved, says Prof Geeta Nargund, a consultant at St George's Hospital and medical director of Create Fertility.",
      "Fat in the body helps make the sex hormone oestrogen.",
      "\"If the sport is affecting body fat content, then quite clearly there's an effect on oestrogen levels,\" she says.",
      "Psychological stress \u2013 potentially from the pressures of training and competing \u2013 can also disrupt the menstrual cycle.",
      "\"We do see this in women with high levels of anxiety,\" said Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Disruption to periods and egg release is the most clearly recognised impact on a female athlete's fertility, but this should resolve once they retire from competition, she notes.",
      "Ectopic and miscarriage",
      "For those who do manage to conceive, things can still go wrong. After an egg is fertilised, it should implant into the lining of the womb. However, in an ectopic pregnancy the egg implants elsewhere, usually in the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the womb.",
      "Around 11,000 pregnancies a year in the UK are ectopic. It's not completely clear why they happen, although inflammation and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes can increase the risk.",
      "\"But in this case, I don't see a direct link between sports and an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy,\" said Prof Nargund, who has treated athletes struggling with their fertility.",
      "However, she said there was a potential link between too much intense exercise in the first three months of pregnancy and miscarriage \u2013 although far more research is needed to be certain.",
      "She pointed to a large Danish study that followed more than 90,000 women and suggested the more intense exercise women did, the higher the risk. This was particularly for weight-bearing and high-impact exercises.",
      "\"If you end up in the Laura Kenny territory where you're an elite athlete, you're the very top of that,\" Prof Nargund said.",
      "But she explained the findings needed to be taken \"with caution\" because the way the study was designed meant there could be other explanations that had not been considered.",
      "Meanwhile, a very small study of 34 Norwegian athletes found no increased risk of fertility problems, including miscarriage.",
      "\"We need to do a lot more research when it comes to sports, exercise, hormone balance and reproduction,\" says Prof Nargund.",
      "Athletes freezing their eggs",
      "Lauren Nicholls played elite level netball for 10 years then had two children, before becoming coach of Super League champions Loughborough Lightning. She says the conversations current players have about fertility are different to the ones she had with her teammates.",
      "\"I know a few of the slightly older players - they've frozen eggs and made those decisions for their family for a later date,\" she says. \"Because they're worried about their career.\"",
      "Juggling being an elite athlete and starting a family has always been a tricky challenge. For women, their years of peak fertility overlap with the time they hit their physical peak.",
      "Male athletes are also not immune to fertility issues. Burning more energy than you have coming in may affect testosterone levels, cause sperm abnormalities and even erectile dysfunction.",
      "But for Dr Emma Pullen, a sports exercise researcher at Loughborough, the lack of definitive answers on the impact of elite sport is emblematic of how poorly female athletes have been researched, from fertility to injury risk.",
      "She said research was \"playing catch up\" with the amount of attention on male sport.",
      "\"We're seeing the repercussions of that with growing professionalisation of women's sports and more female athletes than ever before,\" Dr Pullen adds.",
      "Overall, Prof Nargund argues female athletes are likely to face more fertility challenges than other women.",
      "\"There seems to be a fertility problem because of [elite sport's] potential effect on ovulation, including potentially a higher risk of miscarriage,\" she says.",
      "But a definitive answer on exactly how much elite-level exercise is too much is not clear. And that's enough for Dame Laura, for now.",
      "\"The conversation in itself I feel is really important because I want people to start talking,\" Laura says. \"Honestly, I would love it if it was a lot more open.\"",
      "The relationship between exercise and fertility affects all of us though, even if we're a long way from Olympic glory.",
      "How does exercise affect everyone else's fertility?",
      "Most men and women benefit from exercising and losing excess weight before trying to conceive \u2013 this is known to boost fertility.",
      "Regular physical activity reduces stress, improves sleep and makes periods more regular in those with the hormonal condition polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",
      "But amateur female athletes who train intensively can also end up running on empty and seeing their periods stop, or become irregular.",
      "\"Not to quite the same extent, but it's there,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Making sure there's a balance between energy intake and energy output is \"really important to ovulatory cycles\" and the key to maintaining reproductive function, she adds.",
      "\"[Amateur athletes] are not aware of the fact of how many calories they really need to put in to meet that energy demand.\""

      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", with an independent commission due to begin work in April.",
      "But the commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Councils and care providers say that is too long to wait for the reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",

      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",

    "story": [
      "A group of MPs says compensation is not being paid quickly enough for the victims of the Post Office scandal and is calling for the government to face financial penalties if the process doesn't speed up.",
      "The Business and Trade Select Committee said binding timeframes were needed, with any money arising from missed deadlines going to the claimants if they weren't met.",
      "The committee also called for the Post Office to be removed from its role in the compensation schemes, and asked for more transparency over how much it was paying for lawyers.",
      "The government said it was \"working tirelessly\" to settle claims \"at a faster rate than ever before\".",
      "Committee chairman Liam Byrne MP said: \"The fault lies with the Post Office, but ultimately government is the shareholder in the Post Office and acts on our behalf\".",
      "The government is already looking at the Post Office's role in the compensation schemes.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted and convicted based on information from a faulty accounting system, Horizon, which made it look like money was missing.",

      "One of those accused, Seema Misra, was eight weeks pregnant when she was wrongfully imprisoned.",
      "Speaking to the BBC after she was made an OBE in the King's New Year list for her role in campaigning for justice, she said it was an acknowledgement of the \"scale of the injustice and scandal\".",

      "It found the application process was akin to a second trial for the victims, adding that lawyers administering the schemes were making millions whilst the vast majority of the money set aside for redress had still to be paid out.",
      "The committee's recommendations include providing upfront legal advice for victims and hard deadlines for administrators to approve claims - with financial penalties if they take too long.",
      "Only around \u00a3499m of the budgeted \u00a31.8bn has been paid out so far, to more than 3,000 claimants. The committee said that meant 72% of the budget had still not paid.",
      "Many of those with the most complicated claims have still to be fully settled.",
      "\"This is quite simply, wrong, wrong, wrong\", Byrne said.",
      "\"There are still thousands of victims who have not had the redress to which they are entitled.",

      "Talking to the BBC, he said that  \"for every \u00a34 that the taxpayer is paying out in redress payments, \u00a31 is going to the lawyers\".",
      "Byrne added that hard deadlines and fines would help the government and the Post Office to \"get a grip\".",
      "A Post Office spokesperson said the firm was \"focused on paying redress as swiftly as possible\", adding that its spending on external law firms was kept \"under constant review\".",
      "\"Our chair said at the Public Inquiry in October that redress schemes administered by us should be transferred to the government, and we will support the Department for Business and Trade on any decisions they may take regarding this matter,\" the spokesperson added.",

      "The Post Office told the select committee in December that legal fees had made up \u00a3136m of the cost of administering the Post Office-led schemes since 2020, which is around 27% of the compensation paid out.",

    "summary": "Newly-released files show ministers had concerns about more workers coming to the UK when the EU expanded.",
    "story": [
      "Senior ministers urged the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to delay granting employment rights to eastern and central European workers when the EU expanded in 2004, newly released files have revealed.",
      "In February that year, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pointed out that Britain was alone amongst the bigger EU members in offering a \"concession\".",
      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",
      "His letter was copied to other senior ministers, and the then-deputy prime minister John Prescott supported Straw.",
      "Prescott wrote that he was \"extremely concerned\" about the potential impact on social housing.",
      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",
      "Eight eastern and central European countries joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. According to the government, the number of Polish nationals living in the UK increased from around 69,000 to around 853,000 over the next decade.",
      "Blair asked whether the UK could have work permits, but instead the Home Office speedily drew up a \"workers registration scheme\".",
      "That scheme required A8 workers - those from the eight new member states - to pay a fee and register their employment in a specific job. Failing to do so would incur a significant fine.",
      "From May 2004 onwards, No 10 monitored these registration numbers week by week.",
      "The government was particularly worried because it had publicly estimated that only 13,000 new workers a year would come to Britain after the EU expanded.",
      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",
      "However Kate Gross noted \"the key elephant trap is how these figures relate to previous HO [Home Office] projections\".",
      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",
      "The problem was, the scheme wasn't providing an accurate record.",
      "The self-employed did not have to register, for example, which excluded many building workers like carpenters.",
      "And there was little enforcement.",
      "The shortcomings of the workers registration scheme were exposed in late 2005, when according to the WRS there were only 95 Polish plumbers in the whole of the  UK.",
      "In 24 hours the Daily Mail found 95 Polish plumbers in London alone.",
      "Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of A8 nationals, mostly Polish, moved to the UK.",

      "One of the volumes was offered for sale earlier this year by a London auction house who said it had been rescued from a waterlogged basement by a former civil servant, but the government blocked the sale saying it was Crown property.",
      "Dr Jack Brown, lecturer at King's College London described the books as \"wonderful... historical novelties\".",
      "As the first resident researcher at No 10, he explained the book wasn't left on a table for everyone to sign, but only offered to special guests.",
      "Some left private messages, especially to Margaret Thatcher, who spent more than a decade in Downing Street from 1979 to 1990.",
      "In 1989, then US President George Bush wrote: \"With Respect, Friendship and Gratitude for this Relationship that means so much\".",
      "Dr Brown said he was referring to the so-called special relationship between Britain and the US, rather than a personal bond, but President Bush's wife Barbara also signed, adding: \"Me. Too.\"",

      "The visitors' book seems to have been introduced by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, who was in office from 1970-1974.",
      "Among the earliest to sign it were members of the Royal Family, who left just their first name, including in March 1971 an entry which reads \"Charles\", from the then Prince of Wales.",
      "Many Asian and African leaders signed the first volume. One name from 12 July 1971, in uneven letters reads: \"General I Amin Dada\" \u2013 Idi Amin of Uganda.",
      "Amin had taken power in a coup six months before, and the brutal nature of his regime wasn't yet clear to Western governments. In 1971 he was invited to Buckingham Palace, as well as Downing Street.",
      "Just a year later, Amin expelled tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians, giving them only 90 days to leave the country. Many held British passports and came to settle in the UK.",
      "Among the world leaders - including Jimmy Carter, Ferdinand Marcos and Indira Gandhi - is an anomaly, four pages packed with signatures of well-known British women of 1978 - Anna Ford, Cleo Laine, Prue Leith and Janet Street-Porter.",
      "The latter was a well-known face on TV, but Janet Street-Porter remembers being intimidated by the event, a reception to mark 50 years of equal suffrage.",
      "\"I always appeared cocky and self-assured,\" she said, \"but to be invited to Downing Street for something so historically important was quite a formidable experience for me.\"",
      "While there were many receptions in Downing Street, the book was brought out for very few \u2013 including to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Downing Street in 1985.",
      "The Queen and Prince Philip signed, as did six other prime ministers, including the increasingly frail Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton.",
      "The book captures the changing times: President Mikhail Gorbachev signed in April 1989, when he came for a state visit with his wife, Raisa.",
      "Early the following year, the leaders of the newly independent Eastern European countries visited No 10 - including Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, who added his trademark little heart.",
      "The book seems to have been rarely used by John Major and Tony Blair, though there is one striking message from early 2002, a few months after the 9/11 attacks.",

      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",

      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",
      "There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.",
      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",
      "Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.",

      "His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.",
      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",

      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",
      "\"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.",

      "He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.",

      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",

      "Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.",
      "They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.",
      "Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".",
      "While the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.",
      "What happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative.",
      "\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.",
      "\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"",
      "Humans may not have survived without Neanderthals",
      "They are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.",

      "\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"",
      "The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.",
      "Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
      "The researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations.",
      "They combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.",
      "This created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.",
      "Each of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.",
      "\"We want to understand many different epochs in European and British history, from the Roman period, when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, through the Viking period and see how this shapes the ancestry and diversity of this part of the World,\" he said.",
      "As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.",

      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",
      "He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be \"more efficient\".",
      "AI assistants and humanoid robots",
      "Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.",
      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",
      "Life on Mars?",
      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",
      "Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. \"I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,\" he says.",
      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",

      "\"And I thought 'I've never seen anything like that before.'\"",

      "\"And bless me if the Astronomer Royal didn't reply, with a letter I've still got.\"",
      "Michael Woodman had witnessed a rare celestial event that briefly dazzled the heavens. Not only that, the Astronomer Royal informed him that he was the first person in the country to have seen this.",

      "\"I hit the jackpot,\" he says.",
      "How to look for T Cor Bor",
      "Now a whole new generation of stargazers are scanning the skies again because scientists believe T Cor Bor ignites about every 80 years or so.",
      "On a crystal clear night, in the Dark Skies Reserve of Bannau Brycheiniog, also known as the Brecon Beacons, astronomers are setting up their telescopes.",
      "\"T Cor Bor is dim at the minute  - it's magnitude 10, well below what you can see with the naked eye,\" explains Dr Jenifer Millard from Fifth Star Labs.",
      "To find the area of sky where it should appear, she advises to first locate the plough and follow its handle to Arcturus. To the west of this star is the curved constellation of Corona Borealis, made up of seven stars, and where T Cor Bor will at some point light up.",
      "\"It is only going to be visible to the naked eye for a couple of days,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course, if you've got a small pair of binoculars or a small telescope, you'll be able to see it for a little bit longer because you've got that magnifying tool. But I do think that it is the short stint in the sky that makes it really special.\"",
      "The astronomical phenomenon is caused by the interaction between two stars orbiting each other.",
      "A small white dwarf, which is a dead star, is locked in a cosmic dance with a much larger red giant - a star that's reaching the end of its life.",
      "The compact white dwarf has an immense gravitational pull, so great that it steals material away from its larger neighbour.",
      "\"The gravity on the surface of the white dwarf is a million times the gravity we feel on Earth, so if we stood on it, we would be crushed instantly,\" explains Dr Jane Clark, from the Cardiff Astronomical Society.",
      "Over time, the material it grabs from the other star gets crushed and compressed - until eventually it triggers a nuclear explosion, releasing a huge amount of energy - a process known as going nova.",
      "\"And when that happens, it will shine like the best Christmas tree in town,\" says Dr Clark.",
      "Astronomers think this process happens on repeat, with an outburst from T Cor Bor occurring about every 80 years.",
      "But there aren't many records of this. And there have already been a few false alarms that T Cor Bor was about to appear - followed by a disappointing no show.",
      "But Dr Chris North from Cardiff University says astronomers around the world are poised to catch the light show, which will allow them to study this star in more detail than ever before.",
      "And he's hopeful it could appear soon.",
      "\"It seems that in the past, this has dimmed a little bit before it's actually erupted, and there are signs that maybe, at the moment, it's just dipping a little bit in brightness,\" he says.",
      "\"So maybe that's a hint that it's getting close to its eruption.\"",

      "\"Somebody will get me into a car and drive me out into the wild somewhere so I can have a decent look. That's what we are hoping for,\" he says.",
      "And if he catches another glimpse of the light show, he believes it will put him in a very exclusive club - of just one.",
      "\"Eighty years on, we're all looking at the skies again, not only me, but the whole world apparently,\" he says.",

      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",

      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",

      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",

      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",

      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",

      "LA voters in 2024 overwhelmingly supported a ballot measure to require the city to build more bike lanes and more walkable, livable spaces in Los Angeles.",
      "But will car-loving Angelenos embrace bike culture? Some are actively fighting the changes, grumbling that bike lanes only worsen traffic for cars in the city of stars.",
      "\"What do you mean we voted for it? Not here! Not me!\" said Darin Drabing, the president and CEO of Forest Lawn Cemetery, who is fighting against bike lanes near the cemetery because he thinks it will increase traffic during his commute and funerals.",
      "\"Everywhere I've seen [it] implemented, they failed,\" he said. \"All it does is increase congestion and frustration for people.\"",
      "Some do fail.",
      "While protected bike lanes have transformed Olympic host cities like Paris and London, politicians are currently trying to rip out bike lanes in Toronto that have been a part of the city's streets for almost a decade (they are being sued by cyclists to stop that plan).",
      "In Los Angeles County, the city of Glendale recently voted to remove some bike lanes after complaints about increased traffic.",
      "And new protected bike lanes are creating frustration along Hollywood Boulevard, where automobile traffic is now limited to one lane in each direction for several miles. But it's also causing others to commute by bike occasionally instead of driving.",
      "Cyclist Mimi Holt used to ride her bike in Seattle then quit riding for nearly 20 years out of fear of speeding drivers on LA's busy streets.",
      "\"In LA people drive so fast, it's so utterly terrifying,\" she said.",

      "She said she can't wait for the city's \"islands of bike lanes\" to be connected to one another.",
      "\"If only there was a connecting path, I would be on them all the time,\" Ms Holt said, adding that she would get rid of her car if cycling safely everywhere were an option in Los Angeles.",

      "But with over 100 miles (160km) of bike lanes planned, advocates worry the process is taking too long.",
      "So far, just five of the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" projects have been completed and 23 are in progress - and not all of them are expected to be completed in time for the Games.",
      "Los Angeles has already secured $900m (\u00a3717m) from the Biden administration to help mostly with rail projects. But it will take more to make the city's transit dreams come true by 2028.",

      "Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.",
      "Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.",

    "summary": "From space junk gel to hologram surgery, the team had lots of intriguing predictions. Which, if any, came true?",
    "story": [
      "In 1995, the BBC's Tomorrow's World programme decided to predict what the world would look like 30 years later, in 2025.",
      "The show, which is no longer broadcast, featured one of the most famous scientists of the age, Prof Stephen Hawking, who predicted: \"By 2025 we can expect big changes.\"",
      "The programme team agreed, suggesting a raft of world-shaking innovations from hologram surgery to space junk gel.",
      "So, with the help of some experts - and the benefit of three decades of hindsight - let's take a look at how much of today's world that Tomorrow's World successfully anticipated.",
      "The 'Cyberspace Riots' of 2005",
      "In 1995, the world wide web was really taking off - a development Tomorrow's World thought would bring future trouble.",
      "They predicted \"business barons\" and banks would take control of the internet by 2000, establishing a \"supernet\" which they restricted access to.",
      "That, in turn, would prompt hacks, viruses and even riots.",
      "Verdict - The internet has remained - mostly - open, and there have been no riots but there is little doubt the actions of hackers have caused misery for many people.",
      "One thing the programme didn't predict was the role of the nation state hackers like North Korea, expertly told in the BBC's Lazarus Heist podcast.",
      "Cybersecurity is hugely important for governments and companies, and people who are suspicious of banks have championed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Asteroid mining and space junk gel",
      "The programme speculated space mining would become a lucrative industry, with companies excavating asteroids near Earth for precious metals.",
      "The show also suggested space junk would become such a problem it would not be safe for astronauts. The answer - a gigantic foam gel to slow down debris.",
      "Verdict - Well, there is no super foam gel and the problem of space junk is an acute one. There is also no space mining industry - but that could change.",
      "Futurist Tom Cheesewright is an optimist about mining beyond our planet.",
      "\"The potential riches are unfathomable and the technology is entirely within our grasp,\" he said.",

      "Tomorrow's World predicted by 2004, a law would be passed for all UK hospitals to publish a league table of surgeon success rates. The top surgeons would become so popular, and so well paid, it would make no sense for them to travel to patients.",
      "Instead, patient holograms would be sent to them and the surgeon would operate using \"spacial gloves\". At the patient's end, a robot would perfectly mimic the movements of the surgeon.",
      "Verdict - They didn't get it exactly right but robots are helping with surgeries.",
      "A smart speaker with a floating head",

      "Verdict - Ultra-fast travel feels as far away as ever, but holograms, smart speakers and VR headsets are becoming ever more prevalent.",
      "Banking using a microchip in your arm",
      "Elsewhere in the programme, we were given a vision of the future of banking.",
      "It featured a woman going to a bank, complaining there were no humans, and then withdrawing 100 \"Euro marks.\" The bank gives her the money after scanning a chip in her arm.",
      "Verdict - Banking has indeed become more and more automated. And though paying via microchips inside the human body is a reality, other technologies - mainly fingerprint and face scanning - are much more widely used.",
      "Memories from the presenters",
      "Gardeners' World star Monty Don was one of the presenters on that Tomorrow's World programme 30 years ago. His segment predicted a huge restoration of British woodlands thanks to genetic engineering and multi-storey agri facilities, leading to the return of animals including the brown bear.",
      "Reflecting on it now, he told BBC News that his part of the programme was \"utopian\" and \"naive\".",
      "Looking towards the next 30 years, he is pleased the current generation of young people are \"much more sensitive to climate change\" and thinks people will be growing more of their own food by 2055.",

      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "He added: \"Tomorrow's World was by definition geared towards the way that mankind could change and improve the world, whereas what we have really learnt since then is that mankind has a habit of making things worse, particularly environmentally, and we have to work with nature rather than try modify and control it.\"",
      "Vivienne Parry was another presenter on the prediction show, and fronted a section about medicine.",
      "She fondly remembers filming it - and the rather limited visual effects of the day. \"I had to stay absolutely still. I had a set of glasses on with a little camera attached. They were stuck on my face via a big blob of black sticky stuff.",
      "\"It was this fantastically hot day, and this black stuff started to leak down my face and I couldn't move. Someone from make-up came along with a long cane with cotton wool on the end to get it off.\"",
      "Vivienne has been involved with Genomics England since 2013, and highlights that some of the predictions from the 1995 Tomorrow's World about genomic sequencing have come true, as she works on a research study to help diagnose and treat genetic conditions.",
      "So what could the world look like in 2055?",
      "Futurist Tracey Follows thought the 1995 programme got a lot of big ideas right, but missed two of the biggest themes of the last 30 years - the spread of big tech and social media.",
      "By 2055, she thinks many people will be \"cognitively connected\" - a hive mind of humans and technology via servers, which will help in the sharing of ideas.",

    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",

      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",

      "The operation started out with a 20-strong team, but quickly multiplied to some 150 people. Even then, they were outnumbered.",
      "While about half of the team was able to get inside, they were locked for hours in a standoff with security officers - who are still responsible for protecting Yoon, despite him being stripped of his powers - and a military unit responsible for protecting the city of Seoul.",

      "Yoon's legal team was also seen entering the residence slightly past noon local time.",

    "summary": "Financial problems at battery maker Northvolt have shaken hopes for Sweden's green industry sector.",
    "story": [
      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",
      "The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free fuel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",
      "Headquartered in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups.",
      "Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant.",
      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

    "summary": "The Lijjat co-operative, run by women, employs more than 45,000 people and is famous for its crispy poppadoms.",
    "story": [
      "On a chilly December morning, a group of women wrapped in colourful saris, warm shawls and woollen caps huddled outside a three-storey building in a busy neighbourhood in Delhi.",
      "Within the walls of the building ran a unit of one of India's oldest social enterprises, owned and run by women.",
      "The co-operative - now called Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad - was started in 1959 in Mumbai (then Bombay) by seven housewives who made the humble papad or poppadoms, a crispy, savoury snack that is a staple of Indian meals.",
      "Sixty-five years later, the co-operative - headquartered in Mumbai - has spread across India with more than 45,000 women members. It has an annual turnover of 16bn rupees ($186m; \u00a3150m) and exports products to countries including the UK and US.",
      "Working mostly from home, the women in this co-operative produce items including detergents, spices and chapatis (flatbreads), but their most-loved product is the Lijjat brand of poppadoms.",
      "\"Lijjat is a temple for us. It helps us earn money and feed our families,\" says Lakshmi, 70, who manages the Delhi centre.",
      "Ms Lakshmi, who uses only one name, joined the co-operative about four decades ago after her husband died, which forced her to look for work.",
      "\"I hadn't finished my studies and didn't know what else to do. That's when my neighbour told me about Lijjat,\" she says.",
      "The decision to join the women's co-operative transformed her life, she says. She now manages 150 women at the centre.",
      "For women like Ms Lakshmi, the co-operative offers a chance to earn a decent income while balancing their work at home.",
      "Every morning, the women members take a bus hired by the co-operative to the nearest Lijjat centre. There, they collect their share of pre-mixed dough made with lentils and spices, which they take home to roll into poppadoms.",
      "\"I used to go home with this dough and do all my housework, feed my children and sit with my chakla [a flat wooden board] and a belan [rolling pin] in the afternoon to make small round thin papads,\" says Ms Lakshmi.",
      "Initially, it took her four-five hours to make 1kg of dried lentil papad, but she says she can now produce that amount in just half an hour.",
      "The head office in Mumbai buys raw materials like lentils, spices and oil in bulk, mixes the flour and sends it to Lijjat offices around the country.",
      "Once the women make and dry the poppadoms at home, they deliver them back to the centre for packaging. Lijjat's distributor network then transports the products to retail shops.",
      "The enterprise has come a long way since it was founded.",
      "In the 1950s, a newly independent India was focusing on rebuilding itself, trying to strike a balance between promoting small-scale, rural industries and pushing for large urban factories.",
      "It was also a time when the government owned most of the factories in the country. Life for women was especially challenging as they had to negotiate a deeply conservative and patriarchal society to get educated and work.",
      "The group of women who founded Lijjat - Jaswantiben Jamnadas Poppat, Parvatiben Ramdas Thodani, Ujamben Narandas Kundalia, Banuben N Tanna, Laguben Amritlal Gokani, Jayaben V Vithalani and Diwaliben Lukka - were in their 20s and 30s, living in a crowded tenement in Mumbai and looking for ways to support their families.",
      "Their idea was simple - work from home and earn money by using the cooking skills passed down to them through generations of women.",
      "But they did not have money to buy ingredients and sought financial assistance from Chhaganlal Karamshi Parekh, a social worker.",
      "He offered them a loan of 80 rupees ($0.93; \u00a30.75 at today's rates), which was enough to get started at the time.",
      "But the women soon realised that there were no takers for their poppadoms. Narrating the story, Swati Paradkar, the current president of the co-operative, says that the women had to return to Parekh for help.",
      "He again lent them 80 rupees, but this time with the condition that they would repay 200 rupees to him. Parekh - whom the women called Bappa (meaning father) - and other social workers took the poppadoms to local shopkeepers, who agreed to stock them only if they could pay after the products were sold.",
      "Only one shopkeeper agreed to pay the women immediately. \"He began purchasing four to six packets daily and gradually the poppadoms became quite popular,\" Ms Paradkar says.",
      "As the business grew, more women joined the co-operative - not as employees, but as co-owners with a say in decision-making. The women call each other ben or sister in Gujarati.",
      "\"We are like a co-operative and not a company. Even though I am the president, I am not the owner. We are all co-owners and have equal rights. We all share profits and even losses,\" Ms Paradkar says. \"I think that's the secret of our success.\"",
      "For decades, the co-operative produced its poppadoms without the iconic Lijjat brand name.",
      "In 1966, the Khadi Development And Village Industries Commission, a government organisation to promote small rural industries, suggested that they come up with a brand name.",
      "The co-operative placed an advertisement in newspapers asking for suggestions. \"We received a lot of entries but one of our own sisters suggested Lajjat. We tweaked it to Lijjat, which means taste in Gujarati\", Ms Paradkar says.",
      "Over the decades, the co-operative has allowed generations of women to attain financial independence.",
      "\"Today I have put my children through school, built a house and got them married,\" says Ms Lakshmi.",
      "\"Working here, I have found not just an income but respect.\"",

      "How does the public domain work?",
      "Copyright protects an original work for a finite amount of time. When this protection expires, the work enters the public domain. The founding fathers wrote this concept into the U.S. Constitution under the intellectual property clause, intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"",
      "However, the laws governing the public domain can be tricky. For example: Although Mickey Mouse returned to the people in 2024, this classification only applied to his first appearance in 1928's \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was not until 1929 that Mickey began wearing white gloves, meaning any public reinterpretation showcasing this characteristic could have been liable for copyright infringement until this year.",
      "When does intellectual property enter the public domain?",
      "In the U.S., the length of copyright protection for a certain property depends on various elements. Generally, for works published or registered before 1978, the term lasts 95 years. For works created after this date, protection typically lasts for the author's life plus 70 years.",
      "\"The public domain doesn't represent the death of copyright,\" said Jenkins. \"It's just the second part of copyright's life cycle.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs.",
      "A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison \u2014 a form of pre-trial detention \u2014 was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October.",
      "The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge.",
      "The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison.",
      "The hotel manager and hotel reception manager who were charged saw Payne intoxicated and unable to stand in the hotel lobby prior to his death, according to a\u00a0news release from the prosecutor's office. Authorities said the manager permitted Payne to be taken up to his room, which had a balcony, and the reception manager helped bring him up to his room, instead of keeping him in a place without sources of danger and with company until medical help could arrive.",
      "In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\" in the moments before his death.",
      "Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history but not every legal issue between them.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's lawyer, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A representative for Pitt, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, strongly denied Jolie's allegations.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",
      "Pitt, the star of \"Fight Club\" and \"Inglourious Basterds,\" thrived as both actor and producer after the split. He won his own Academy Award for 2019's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" the crowning achievement in an awards season that some in media framed as a redemption and brought major public affection for him.",
      "Jolie has kept a less visible profile in the years since the divorce, though she directed several films and appeared in several more while trying to focus on raising the children.",
      "She has very much returned to the Oscar conversation this year for her portrayal of the legendary soprano Maria Callas in \"Maria.\"",

    "title": "Nikki Glaser takes on the Golden Globes",
    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:38:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The comedian, who will host the Golden Globes on January 5, says she thrives on anxiety.",
    "story": [
      "\"When you're a white, pasty girl, you get a spray tan, everyone's nicer to you!\" said Nikki Glaser during her standup act. \"They think, like, you've been on vacation, they think things are going well in your life. And they're not; you've just stood naked in front of a teenager. \u2026 And in the middle of her spraying me, like, seeing my butt, she goes, 'I'm such a fan!'\"",
      "Glaser thought she had her January all planned out: \"So, for January 2025, I was going to possibly have, like, a brow lift or some kind of, like, really invasive surgery that I've been, you know, looking into getting.\"",
      "The kind of procedure where you have to disappear from the public for a while, and then re-emerge. But then, she got a phone call from TWO of her agents: \"And when it's two, you know it's good news, because when it's bad news, they just make one person do it, 'cause no one wants to do that! And they're like, 'So, this operation, is there any way you could push it 'til maybe the second week of January?'\"",
      "That's because on January 5, Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes on CBS \u2013 just another big gig in a year that's been filled with them.",
      "Her 2024 special, \"Someday You'll Die,\" was nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.",
      "\"It's easy to be a bad mom; that's so easy. But to be a good mom is hard. To be a bad mom, that's as easy as being a great dad.\"",
      "But it's the special's theme song that Glaser wrote that she's most proud of: \"Honestly, it might be, like, one of the things I'm most proud of in my entire life.\"",
      "\"It couldn't be more different than joke writing, right, in terms of the vulnerability?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, yes, because everything with joking is, like, I get vulnerable, then I cut it with, like, some kind of line that's like, 'I'm just kidding.' I was talking about my depression, but we're all not gonna get emotional here. There's just something so embarrassing about being emotional for me. So, I think I just have to reframe it as like, 'You can't do it, Nikki. It's too hard,' and I'll be like, 'Yes, I can.'\"",
      "Glaser made her name in celebrity roasts with a searing joke style, deadpanning at her own expense and the expense of others, jokes we mostly can't play for you on network TV \u2013 all of which came in handy earlier this year when she roasted NFL great Tom Brady live on Netflix.",
      "\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"",
      "Glaser says, though she's mostly done with roasts, she actually asked Netflix for the job: \"I was like, 'Tell Tom Brady I'm the Tom Brady of roasting.' It's flattery, but it's also true. I meant it. I really feel like Tom Brady is a guy that worked hard enough to become how great he is.\"",
      "The same could be said about Glaser \u2026 and the Golden Globes will be her biggest audience to date. \"I'm gonna nail it,\" she said. \"Maybe I won't nail it in some people's eyes, but I will have nailed it in my eyes because I have set up a system leading up to it that I couldn't possibly work harder on it.\"",
      "More on that system later \u2026 because confidence is not something that's always come easy to Glaser.",
      "She's talked about struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders, and alcoholism. \"I drank every single night of my life and it was, like, the only thing I looked forward to in my life,\" she said. \"For me, drinking was the worst of all of them. And it's been kind of whack-a-mole with all of those. But those have never caused me as much pain as drinking did. So, I'm glad that drinking is just not an option.\"",
      "I said, \"In recovery they talk about this thing called, like, the 'dis-ease' \u2013 just this kind of general state of not being at ease.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Glaser said. \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",
      "Will the pressure of hosting the Globes get to Glaser? She says she hopes it does. \"I thrive on anxiety,\" she said. \"I like feeling like, 'Oh, what's gonna happen?' I like that feeling. I kill it when I'm anxious.\"",
      "Glaser's \"system,\" which she first developed for the Brady roast, is working with a team of writers that includes Sean O'Conner, Jessica Dweck, and Glaser's longtime boyfriend and collaborator, Chris Convy.",
      "Those jokes they come up are then tested over and over, both on the road and in small L.A. clubs, to see what real audiences think.",
      "\"I did have a bunch of Ozempic jokes that I was gonna tell, but I lost them. The natural way, I swear! I just cut out soda.\"",
      "The Golden Globes audience will decide on January 5th if all this preparation by Glaser has paid off. But she says, in a certain way, she's already working on her next project, an off-stage one at that.",
      "\"I think my new challenge is, I wanna be known for being a nice celebrity,\" Glaser said. \"I just wanna be someone that people go, 'Oh, she's really great to work with. She was really nice to us,' and not in an inauthentic way.\"",
      "\"You wanna spread kindness to people while you're eviscerating their entire existence in your periphery?\" I asked.",
      "\"That's the paradox of it,\" she said. \"I wanna spread honesty.\"",
      "Don't miss the 82nd annual Golden Globes ceremony live on January 5 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS and Paramount+.",

They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge.",
      "The case was dismissed by a Los Angeles County judge in 2023, who found their depiction could not be considered child pornography and the pair filed their claim too late.",

    "summary": "The H5N1 bird flu virus has been found in samples of Monarch Raw Pet Food, and a cat that ate the food is confirmed to have been infected.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles county public health officials have issued a new warning to pet owners to stop feeding dogs and cats raw pet food after the H5N1 bird flu virus was found in product samples.",
      "\"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is advising residents to not feed their pets Monarch Raw Pet Food sold at several farmers markets in California,\" the agency said, noting that an L.A. county house cat that was fed the product had been confirmed to have the virus. Four other cats from the same home were \"presumed to have also been positive for H5 bird flu after consuming the product.\"",
      "The health department urged residents who fed their pets the Monarch raw food products or any other raw meat or dairy items and noticed their animal exhibiting any unusual behavior to immediately contact their veterinarian.",
      "\"Residents should avoid consumption of all raw milk and raw meat products and not feed these to their pets,\" the agency stressed in its statement Tuesday.",
      "Cats infected with H5N1 bird flu can develop severe illness with symptoms ranging from neurological changes and respiratory problems to liver disease, which can rapidly progress to death.",
      "The health agency said there had been no human cases of bird flu associated with exposure to these cats yet identified.",
      "The Los Angeles health agency did not mention any formal recall of the Monarch products on Tuesday, and the company also provided no information about a recall, or the bird flu cases on its website.",
      "Warning comes after previous raw pet food recall over bird flu",
      "The death of an Oregon house cat and a recent pet food recall had already raised questions about the ongoing outbreak of bird flu and how people can protect their pets.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company in Portland, Oregon, announced a voluntary recall Tuesday of one batch of its 2-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",

      "Bird flu has been spreading for years in wild birds, chickens, turkeys and many other animals. It was first confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in March.",
      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. When the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease.",
      "Top vet warns against raw food for pets",
      "Oregon health officials traced the cat's illness to the frozen Northwest Naturals cat food that contained raw turkey. Virus recovered from the recalled pet food and the infected cat matched.",
      "Some pet owners feed their animals raw meat, but that can be dangerous, even fatal for the animals, said Dr. Michael Q. Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Cooking meat or pasteurizing raw milk destroys the bird flu virus and other disease-causing germs.",
      "\"Raw milk, raw meat products can be and are a vector for carrying this virus,\" he said.",
      "Though cases of infection are rare, cats seem especially susceptible to the bird flu virus, or Type A H5N1. Even before the cattle outbreak, there were feline cases linked to wild birds or poultry. Since March, dozens of cats have caught the virus. These include barn and feral cats, indoor cats, and big cats in zoos and in the wild.",
      "Dogs seem to be less vulnerable than cats, but they should eat only thoroughly cooked foods, Bailey said.",
      "Cats should not drink unpasteurized dairy products or eat raw meat, Bailey said, and pet owners should keep cats away from wild birds, livestock and poultry.",
      "Don't let them wander freely in the outdoors, he said, \"because you don't know what they're getting into. Cats are natural hunters, and one of the animals they love to hunt are birds.\"",
      "Cat owner worried about bird flu? Here's what to know.",
      "Experts say people should avoid touching sick or dead birds, and thoroughly wash your hands after handling poultry or animals.",
      "Cats sick with bird flu might experience loss of appetite, lethargy and fever.",
      "If your cat is usually playful and likes to look out the window, but instead has been sleeping all the time or hiding from you, take note, Bailey said. \"There's something wrong,\" he said.",
      "They could have reddened or inflamed eyes and discharge from the eyes and nose. They might have difficulty breathing or have tremors or seizures.",
      "If your cat is sick, call your veterinary clinic and keep the cat away from anyone with a weakened immune system.",

    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",

      "President Biden is likely to announce a decision as soon as Friday on whether he will approve Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel, according to people familiar with the process.",
      "The president has said in the past he opposed the deal, saying it was vital for U.S. Steel \"to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In recent days, Mr. Biden's top advisers have had extensive discussions with him about whether or not to approve the deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also spoken directly with the president about the matter.",
      "U.S. Steel has indicated it is likely to file lawsuits, including against the Biden administration, if the president blocks the acquisition, sources said. Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS, intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "An earlier proposal suggested an independent majority-American board appointed by CFIUS would make decisions about production. That proposal was submitted to the White House for Mr. Biden's review on Monday.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "According to a source familiar with the process, Nippon Steel's new proposal offers a 10-year guarantee that it would not reduce production capacity at U.S. Steel's mills in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Texas, California and Arkansas without approval by a CFIUS panel, which is led by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.",

    "story": [
      "The vehicles used in two separate incidents, the deadly New Orleans attack and the explosion in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, were rented via the same app, a peer-to-peer service called Turo, the company said.",
      "Authorities are looking into several parallels between the incidents, including that both involved trucks \u2014 a Ford pickup in New Orleans and Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 were rented from Turo and occurred on New Year's Day. Both also involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe, but don't appear to have any known connections.",
      "But on Thursday, an FBI official, Christopher Raia, said that at this point, there's \"no definitive link\" between the two occurrences.",
      "In an email to CBS News, a Turo spokesperson said the company is \"actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.\"",
      "They added, \"We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Turo operates similarly to Airbnb, but with cars instead of houses or apartments. Car owners who aren't using their vehicles can rent them out to others via the app, which handles screening, billing and other services. In some cases, individuals have become \"professional hosts\" by renting out fleets of cars via Turo, according to a company filing.",
      "In a separate email to CBS MoneyWatch, a Turo spokesperson said, \"We are outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Turo.",
      "How many people use Turo?",
      "Turo, which started in 2009, had about 150,000 active hosts who rented out about 350,000 vehicles as of Sept. 30, according to the company's filing. About 3.5 million people rented those cars in the 12-month period through the end of September, it added.",
      "The car rental service operates in 16,000 cities in the U.S., Australia, France, the U.K. and Canada.",
      "How do you rent a car on Turo?",
      "Turo says that in order to use its service, individuals need an email address, Google account or Apple ID, and a valid driver's license. Renters must also provide a home address and payment card.",
      "Customers must be at least 18 years old to rent a car on Turo, or over 25 for more expensive vehicles. For instance, to rent a \"deluxe\" car \u2014 those valued between $45,000 to $85,000 \u2014 drivers must be older than 25. \"Super deluxe\" cars, or those valued over $85,000, are limited to people over 30.",
      "Does Turo screen people who rent cars?",
      "On its website, Turo says \"We may ask for additional photos and information and/or may check your personal and/or business credit report, auto insurance score, and criminal background to verify your account.\"",
      "The man who drove the Ford truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges tied to driving under the influence (DUI), according to CNN.",
      "In the state of Louisiana, a DUI offense is considered a felony on third and subsequent convictions,\u00a0according to Louisiana Court Records, although first-time DUI offenders can face felony charges in instances where a death or violation of child endangerment laws is involved.",
      "Turo also says it relies on its proprietary \"risk score\" to assess potential renters, which relies on \"more than 50 data inputs,\" such as information submitted by customers as well as parameters set by the car owner.",
      "\"Every Turo renter is screened through a proprietary multilayer, data science-based trust and safety process,\" the Turo spokesperson wrote to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"These individuals in question had valid driver's licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military,\" the spokesperson added. \"They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain. We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\"",
      "Who are the men who rented the cars used in the attacks?",
      "The driver in the New Orleans attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas, was a U.S. Army veteran who lived in Houston. The FBI said he posted several videos before the attack proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck from Turo in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove the vehicle to New Orleans on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, he bypassed barriers put in place on Bourbon Street, which included patrol cars and law enforcement, before plowing onto the sidewalk, according to police officials. The attack killed at least 14 people and injured dozens.",
      "In the second Jan. 1 occurrence, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany but on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, rented a Tesla Cybertruck from Turo in Denver.",
      "That Cybertruck, a 2024 model, pulled up to the Trump hotel's glass entrance doors on Wednesday morning, officials said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred. Gasoline and camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building.",
      "The Cybertruck explosion, which is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, killed the driver of the car and injured seven people outside of the vehicle.",
      "The body was \"burnt beyond recognition,\" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a briefing Thursday, but the coroner's office later confirmed it was Livelsberger. Investigators said Livelsberger's military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",

Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",

      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",

      "Tesla delivered 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. But that was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",

      "Some Americans could get a break on their state income taxes this year, with nine states kicking off 2025 with a reduction in their individual income tax rates, according to an\u00a0analysis from the Tax Foundation, a think tank that focuses on taxes.",
      "The changes are part of a recent push to cut taxes at the state level that started during the pandemic when many states found themselves flush with tax revenue. But the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) has termed the trend an \"anti-tax playbook\" that could eventually crimp public services.",
      "Lawmakers typically argue that lowering taxes can help make their states more competitive, helping to draw businesses and new residents within their borders. Seven of the states that are lowering their individual income taxes in 2025 have legislatures that are controlled by Republicans, as well as Republican governors.",

      "Indiana, whose state legislature is controlled by GOP lawmakers and whose governor, Eric Holcomb, is a Republican, will shave its income tax rate to 3% in 2025, down from 3.05% in 2024.",
      "That's a fairly small savings for middle-class residents, according to local news outlet IPB News, which estimates the reduction will result in a tax cut of $33 for a worker earning $65,000 a year.",
      "Iowa",
      "Iowa, which also has a Republican trifecta controlling its statehouse and governor's office, is trimming its individual income tax rate to a flat rate of 3.8% starting Jan. 1, down from a top tax rate of 5.7% in 2024, the Des Moines Register reports.",
      "The new flat tax rate was signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May, who, along with state lawmakers, have argued that the state was collecting too much money from its residents, the publication noted.",

      "Another state with a Republican trifecta in the statehouse and governor's office, Louisiana is cutting its individual income tax rate to a flat rate of 3% starting Jan. 1, down from a graduated tax with a top rate of 4.25% in 2024.",
      "Taxpayers in Louisiana who earn between $30,000 to $40,000 a year, the largest number of taxpayers in any bracket in the state, will see their state taxes reduced by 50%, to $338 a year, according to analysis from RESET Louisiana, a nonpartisan public policy think tank.",

      "Starting on Jan. 1, New Mexico's individual income tax brackets will be reduced for all residents, with the biggest cuts aimed at low- and middle-income taxpayers, the Tax Foundation noted. Gov. Grisham's office said in a statement last year that a married couple filing jointly would save about $303 a year under the new tax brackets.",
      "The state will now have six brackets, versus five in 2024, with rates ranging from 1.5% to 5.9%. Some tax rates will remain the same, but others will change. For instance, the lowest bracket was 1.7% in 2024, according to local publication SourceNM.",
      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina, whose legislature is controlled by the Republican Party while its governor is a Democrat, will cut its tax rate to 4.5% on Jan. 1, down from 4.75% in 2024.",

      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, which closed many businesses and forced government agencies to limit their hours. But Luma noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground power line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria, chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",

      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.

That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",

      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not officially outlined his policy preferences on the H-1B program, but he\u00a0told The New York Post in a Dec. 28 interview that he has \"always been in favor of the visas.\"",
      "\"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times; it's a great program,\" he added. His presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Still, Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge to conduct mass deportations, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We tend to think of ourselves as citizens, or at least residents, of a nation.",
      "After all, the lessons most of us encountered in school included a map of the world divided by lines into countries. Each country, we learned, has a government; and each government rules over its land and its things and its people. The idea of one land, one law, one people, and one government is dominant, powerful, and often accurate. It forms the basis for much of national and international law.",
      "The hidden globe is a kind of transfiguration of this map, an accretion of cracks and concessions, suspensions and abstractions, carve-outs and free zones, and other places without nationality in the conventional sense, stretching from the ocean floor to outer space. The hidden globe is a mercenary world order in which the power to make and shape law is bought, sold, hacked, reshaped, deterritorialized, reterritorialized, transplanted, and reimagined. It is state power catapulted beyond a state's borders. It is also a state's selective abdication of certain powers within its remit: enclaves filled not by lawlessness but by different, weirder laws.",
      "The concept of the loophole originated in the seventeenth century to describe the small vertical slits in a castle wall through which archers could fire without risking enemy exposure. Its modern meaning has not changed all that much, only the archers are lawyers, consultants, and accountants\u2014and the fortress, the state itself.",
      "The desire to carve out exceptions is not new: communities have always set places apart for the purpose of contemplation, ritual, and worship. The Celts called these \"thin places,\" where the distance between heaven and earth was said to be shorter.",
      "Today, our elsewheres and nowheres aren't places of offerings, but places of evasion. They remind us of the newness of our world of bordered, independent states\u2014a mold whose contents began to set only after decolonization\u2014and its vulnerability to more powerful forces.",
      "Capitalists, forever pursuing profit, regard liminal and offshore jurisdictions as frontiers. This book is as much about these modern frontiersmen as it is about their battlegrounds. But theirs is no freewheeling regime of open borders. While the existence of the hidden globe might appear to challenge the myth of the meaningful, unified nation, the nation is too sticky and politically expedient a concept to do away with entirely. In fact, the hidden globe can empower the most xenophobic and exclusionary nationalism. And these policies are not just the domain of the political right. Whether Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, the regimes behind them aim to bring the right people in and keep the wrong ones out.",
      "By enabling nationalist immigration policies, the hidden globe thus circumscribes the lives of the world's most disenfranchised people: there are detainees languishing in offshore prisons in the Caribbean and the Pacific, impoverished workers processing goods for export in duty-free industrial zones across the Global South, sailors and asylum seekers stuck on vessels they cannot leave for lack of papers. When a person can't stay home and is unwanted abroad, they might end up in a third space: neither here nor there. Seeing these spaces for what they are changed the way I saw the world, and I think it will change the way you see it too.",

      "Investigators do not believe there's \"any other danger to the community right now,\" FBI agent Jeremy Schwartz said at a news conference Wednesday evening.",
      "The sole person inside the vehicle died, and seven people suffered minor injuries, Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. He called the explosion \"an isolated incident\" and said there is no indication that it was linked to ISIS.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the Cybertruck was rented to Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, an active duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant, who was serving in Germany but was on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident.",
      "Las Vegas Police said the Clark County Coroner confirmed Thursday that Livelsberger had been identified as the driver of the vehicle in the explosion. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the coroner's office said.",
      "At a briefing earlier Thursday, the FBI said their investigation determined the driver had shot himself in the head before the vehicle detonated, and a gun was found at his feet.",
      "They said they considered Livelsberger the subject of the investigation, but needed a dental or DNA match for identification since the body was burned beyond recognition. They said his military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide,\" McMahill said at the briefing.",
      "CBS News spoke to two relatives of Livelsberger who were unaware of any involvement in the incident, but who confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative told CBS News that Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents have been at his townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday evening and said the activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",

He attended Bucyrus High School in Ohio and enlisted in the Army in 2006. His father said they last spoke on Christmas Day and described everything as normal, emphasizing that Matthew was a devoted father.",
      "Law enforcement officials said Thursday there were no other subjects of the investigation at this time.",
      "Schwartz also noted, \"We do not believe that there's a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\"",
      "A short time after the Cybertruck, a 2024 model that had been rented in Colorado, pulled up to the hotel's glass entrance doors, smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred.",
      "Several videos posted on social media showed the blast and the Cybertruck engulfed in flames.",
      "McMahill said gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building. It's still unclear how the explosives were ignited, he said.",
      "The sheriff said the Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and drove through the Strip before approaching the hotel.",
      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Rep. Bennie Thompson and former Rep. Liz Cheney, the two lawmakers who led the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Mr. Biden presented the awards to Thompson, Cheney and more than a dozen other recipients during a ceremony at the White House on Thursday.",
      "\"I've been honored to present law enforcement officers who defended our Capitol on Jan. 6, and the state and local election officials, elected leaders who defended the free and fair election of 2020,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Today we celebrate a new group of Americans who dedicated their careers to serving our democracy in other essential ways.\"",
      "The White House said Cheney received her award for \"putting the American people over party\" and Thompson received his for \"his lifelong dedication to safeguarding our Constitution.\" Both Thompson and Cheney received loud applause and standing ovations as they received their awards.",
      "\"The Presidential Citizens Medal is awarded to citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens. President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving others. The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice,\" the White House said in announcing those honored.",
      "Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, served as chair and vice chair, respectively, of the House panel that was tasked with examining the events leading up to and on Jan. 6. In the course of its probe, the committee held 10 public hearings, interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and compiled more than 1 million pages of material.",
      "Its work concluded in December 2022 after an investigation that spanned 18 months. The committee voted to refer President-elect Donald Trump and conservative lawyer John Eastman for criminal prosecution because of their alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6.",
      "Trump was charged with four federal criminal counts stemming from his efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 presidential election, but the charges were dismissed following a request by special counsel Jack Smith in November, after Trump was elected to a second term. The special counsel sought to end the prosecution because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "In its announcement of the recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal, the White House said that throughout Cheney's 20 years in public service, Cheney \"has raised her voice \u2014 and reached across the aisle\u2014to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency. Her integrity and intrepidness remind us all what is possible if we work together.\"",
      "Cheney became an ardent opponent of Trump following the 2020 election and endorsed Harris for president.",
      "The White House said of Thompson that he served \"at the forefront of defending the rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to truth\" as chair of the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked Cheney, Thompson and the Jan. 6 committee since the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that they committed crimes and should go to jail. He told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in early December that he \"mostly likely\" will issue pardons to those who have been convicted or pleaded guilty for their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "Mr. Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of Trump from both parties to protect them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration, multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions told CBS News earlier this month. Among those who were under consideration are Cheney, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who served on the Jan. 6 select committee while in the House, and\u00a0retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist.\"",
      "In addition to Cheney and Thompson, Mr. Biden awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Mary Bonauto, an attorney who argued the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage; Bill Bradley, a former NBA player and U.S. senator; and Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a nurse during the Vietnam War and founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation.",
      "Former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Ted Kaufman of Delaware were also honored.",
      "The Presidential Citizens Medal was established in 1969 and is considered the second-highest civilian award of the U.S. government. It recognizes \"citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.\"",

      "\"They represent the best of America,\" the president said of his nominees.",
      "Mr. Biden underscored how judges shape many aspects of American life, from voting rights to workers rights to environmental rules, and said he is proud of his administration's impact on the federal courts.",
      "\"Judges matter, shaping the everyday lives of Americans, protecting our basic freedoms ... defending constitutional liberties, respecting the idea that precedent matters,\" he said. \"These judges will be independent, they'll be fair, and they'll be impartial and respect the rule of law. And most importantly \u2014 I never thought I'd be saying this \u2014 they'll uphold the Constitution.\"",

      "Mr. Biden's pick of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court was historic, as she is the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court.",
      "\"The record is clear: the nominees of President Joseph Biden to the federal bench represent the best of the judiciary, the best of America,\" Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in brief remarks.",
      "One out of every four judges now on the federal bench were nominated by Mr. Biden, he said.",

      "\"When people look back at the most consequential accomplishments of the last four years, two things will stand out: the legislation we passed between 2021 and 2022, and the historic judges we confirmed to the bench,\" the Democratic leader said, adding that Mr. Biden's picks \"will be the shield that protects our democracy\" and \"one of the most important hallmarks of your legacy.\"",
      "Since the start of his administration in 2021, the president, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was in the upper chamber, had pledged to diversify the federal bench by appointing judges from varying professional and personal backgrounds. Mr. Biden's judicial nominees included more than 45 public defenders, including Jackson, and 25 civil rights attorneys.",
      "In addition to tapping the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Mr. Biden also named more Black women to the federal courts of appeals than every previous presidential administration combined, according to the White House.",
      "The 235 judicial confirmations marks the largest number in a four-year term since the late President Jimmy Carter was in office and surpasses Trump's appointments to the federal bench by one. Carter did not appoint any justices to the Supreme Court, but selected a record 262 judges to the federal courts after Congress in 1978 passed legislation creating 35 new appeals court judgeships and 117 district court seats.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The FBI briefed members of the House Homeland Security Committee on the\u00a0truck attack in New Orleans,\u00a0in which authorities say a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd in the French Quarter on New Year's Day.",
      "A committee aide said Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division David Scott told committee members and staff, along with members of the Louisiana congressional delegation, that the agency has not found any evidence that the New Orleans attacker had any co-conspirators or was directed by a foreign actor or terrorist organization.",
      "The attack, which officials said left at least 14 people dead and injured dozens of others, is being investigated as an act of terrorism, the FBI said. Flying from the truck's rear bumper was a black ISIS flag. The FBI has identified Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old from Texas, as the man driving the vehicle. Jabbar had \"posted videos to social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill,\" President Biden said Wednesday.",
      "The agency confirmed the attack was inspired by ISIS, and the attacker had an ISIS flag attached to the hitch of the truck, the aide said.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, the FBI has seized cellphones from the attacker and received approximately 239 leads from the public, as well as conducted over 10 interviews with associates and family members of the attacker, the aide said. The attacker, who was born in the U.S. and is an American citizen, was not on any federal government watchlists or systems, the aide said.",
      "The New Orleans terrorist attack happened the same day that a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside of Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. That explosion, which happened early Wednesday morning, is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, according to law enforcement.",
      "The FBI has not found any connection between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion at this time, but the Army Criminal Investigation Division is conducting an ongoing probe, the committee aide said.",
      "The Committee will continue conducting oversight of the federal government's response to both incidents, the aide said.",
      "The FBI is leading the investigation, and Mr. Biden said in a statement that he has directed his administration to \"ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Troy Carter, who represents the district and serves on the Homeland Security Committee, said on \"CBS Mornings\" that he believes New Orleans is secure, citing the FBI's assessment. He said the area has been swept and an exhaustive search has been conducted throughout the downtown area.",
      "\"There have been a number of leads that are being acted upon, and like any other terrorist event, you can never be too careful, so our caution is to make sure that we leave no stone unturned as it relates to the investigation,\" Carter said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said on Fox News Thursday morning that he had spoken with Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Merrick Garland, noting that \"there are many, many FBI agents that are on the ground that have been dispatched in New Orleans\" who are looking at \"every possible angle.\"",
      "\"We are trusting that that partnership between the federal and state authorities will bring us the answers that we need,\" Johnson added.",
      "Rep. Mike Waltz, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for his national security advisor, said on Fox News that intelligence indicators need to be examined. Although the attacker was born in the U.S., Waltz said that \"the entire world knows that we have an open border\" and \"they intend to hit us, and they are pushing people into our interior to do just that.\"",
      "Waltz said that if the U.S. is investigating \"internally at ourselves, we can't be defending ourselves abroad.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 119th Congress begins Friday with Republicans in full control of the House and Senate for the first time since 2019.",
      "Still, there's the potential for sparks to fly in the House if Republicans revolt against Speaker Mike Johnson during the leadership vote, which is expected to take place shortly after 12 p.m.",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will officially take the reins after flipping the majority in the November elections.",
      "Here's what to know as the new Congress convenes in Washington:",
      "When do the new members of Congress get sworn in?",
      "The new term of Congress, which lasts two years, begins Friday, when House members are expected to be sworn in. But first, they'll have to elect a speaker, which has not come easy for a divided Republican Party in the last two elections to pick their leader.",
      "It took former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, 15 rounds to win the gavel in 2023, delaying the swearing-in of new members by several days. McCarthy was ousted months later, and it took Republicans three weeks to coalesce behind Johnson. The Louisiana Republican is hoping to continue as speaker, but is facing some opposition within his own party after another messy fight last month over government funding.",
      "The Senate swears in members when it convenes Friday and then moves on to other business.",
      "How does the speaker's election work?",
      "Typically, a member from each party will nominate a candidate for speaker ahead of a vote of all incoming members on the House floor. Those candidates were determined in November, when both parties separately decided who they would support for leadership.",
      "Johnson won the backing of Republicans for another term. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, will be nominated by his party. Members are not required to vote for those candidates and could choose to support someone else or no one.",
      "During the roll call vote, members will state aloud who they favor for speaker. The candidate with the majority of votes cast wins the speakership. If no candidate wins on the first round, the vote is repeated until someone secures the majority.",
      "What is the new balance of power in the House and the Senate?",
      "Republicans flipped control of the Senate in the November elections and will have 53 seats. Democrats, including independents who caucus with them, will control 47.",
      "In the House, Republicans held on to their majority, winning 220 seats. Democrats won 215. But President-elect Donald Trump has tapped two Republican members for positions in his administration, cutting into the party's already narrow margins until special elections are held in the coming months. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has also said he would not take his seat, giving Republicans a 219 to 215 edge.",
      "Johnson will need 218 votes to win the speaker's election if all members are present and voting.",
      "What do Republicans want to accomplish first?",
      "Republicans' top priorities include immigration and border security, energy policy and extending tax cuts from Trump's first term. But whether Republicans can quickly accomplish their goals depends on how unified the party is. They plan to use a process called budget reconciliation, which would give them the ability to pass large portions of their agenda with a simple majority, avoiding the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of work to build a consensus among all the Republicans to get it done,\" Johnson told Fox News on Monday.",
      "Trump has also called for the debt ceiling to be increased, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills. Without an increase, it's likely to complicate Republicans' legislative priorities.",

      "Federal prosecutors are seeking to keep the man, Brad Spafford, in custody after his Dec. 17 arrest for allegedly possessing an unregistered short barrel rifle. While executing a search warrant at Spafford's 20-acre farm in the county of Isle of Wight, investigators found \"a stockpile of more than 150 homemade improvised explosive devices\" that were assessed to be pipe bombs, according to prosecutors. They said some of the pipe bombs were labeled \"lethal\" and \"preloaded into an apparent wearable vest.\"",
      "Most of the devices were allegedly found in a detached garage, while others were found in a backpack in a bedroom \"completely unsecured.\" Prosecutors said Spafford also \"acknowledged to keeping a jar in his freezer of HMTD, an explosive material that is so unstable it can be exploded merely as a result of friction of temperature changes.\" Investigators found the jar stored next to food items and labeled \"dangerous\" and \"do not touch,\" prosecutors said.",
      "According to court documents, which were first reported by the website\u00a0Court Watch, the investigation began in early 2023 after Spafford's neighbor told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and had lost three fingers on his right hand.",
      "\"Even after losing his own fingers as a result of his homemade explosive materials, he made the apparent remarkable decision to keep an extraordinarily dangerous explosive material in the home's freezer next to food items that could be accessed by the entire family,\" prosecutors said, arguing the man \"poses an extreme danger to the community\" and should remain in custody.",
      "The neighbor also told authorities that Spafford was using photos of President Biden for target practice at a local shooting range.

      "The Defense Department has filed a motion to delay the plea hearings until Jan. 27 so it can consult with the Department of Justice on whether to appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "If the plea agreements do go through, the three men will plead guilty in separate hearings, and in exchange, the death penalty will be taken off the table.",
      "Military prosecutors\u00a0reached the plea deals\u00a0with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin 'Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi, in late July following more than two years of negotiations. The agreements were approved by a senior Pentagon official who oversees the military court at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "But days after the deals were announced, Austin said he was\u00a0rescinding the pretrial agreements. The defense secretary wrote in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the deals, \"responsibility for such a decision should rest with me.\"",
      "Defense attorneys, meanwhile,\u00a0argued the plea agreements\u00a0still stood and questioned whether Austin exercised undue or unlawful command of influence.",
      "Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, the military judge overseeing the case, then ruled in November that the\u00a0plea deals are valid and enforceable\u00a0after finding that Austin exceeded his authority when he nullified the agreements.",
      "The three Guantanamo Bay detainees were captured by the U.S. in 2003, but their prosecutions have been mired by years of legal delays over whether evidence obtained during their interrogations at secret CIA prisons could be used in court. They were transferred to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2006 and formally charged in 2008.",
      "Prosecutors told the families of 9/11 victims that the three detainees\u00a0agreed to plead guilty\u00a0to conspiracy and murder charges in exchange for a life sentence, removing the death penalty as a possible punishment. They also agreed to respond to questions from the family members about their roles in and reasons for conducting the terror attacks.",

      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",

      "\"The U.S. needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,\" he said in a statement, noting that China \"itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.\"",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",

      "Washington \u2014 Some of the defendants accused of being part of the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, are now asking courts for permission to return to Washington, D.C, on Jan. 20 to attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Many of the approximately 1,600 people who have been charged with felony or misdemeanor crimes for their alleged roles in the Jan. 6 attack have been subjected to court orders restricting their travel to and within the capital. But some have said that they should be afforded permission to return for the inauguration, arguing they are not a threat to public safety.",
      "In a court filing on Monday, the Justice Department argued against allowing defendant Christopher Belliveau to attend the inauguration. \"The last organized event the defendant attended in Washington, D.C., spiraled into a full-scale riot. This was the scene of his charged crime \u2014 a violent felony which contributed to the disruption of the peaceful transition of power,\" federal prosecutors wrote.",
      "\"The most compelling reason to deny Belliveau's motion is that allowing his travel to Washington, D.C. places Capitol Police Officers in danger,\" prosecutors added. \"Belliveau argues that his lack of violent past warrants a modification of his conditions of release. But that makes his return to the Capitol even more concerning \u2014 Belliveau was only willing to engage in violence against Capitol Police Officers who were trying to keep a crowd of rioters under control.\"",
      "Belliveau is accused of deploying bear spray against police during the Capitol attack and has pleaded not guilty. He filed his own motion in support of his request to attend the inauguration. Belliveau's attorneys argued, \"It is also vital to remember that, while Mr. Belliveau stands accused, he is presumed innocent, thus the mere fact that he is charged does not suggest that he is inherently more dangerous that any other person.\"",
      "Defendant Cindy Young, who was found guilty on four criminal charges at trial in August, has also sought permission to travel to Washington for the festivities. In her filing\u00a0on Dec. 11, Young's lawyer said she has \"complied with her conditions of release\" for \"well over a year.\"",
      "\"She poses no threat of danger to the community and she is not a risk of flight. She was allowed to travel several times to Washington, D.C., including to the Capitol building while preparing for trial and there were no incidents,\" Young's attorney said.",
      "But prosecutors opposed Young's request. Writing in response a week later, the Justice Department said Young has \"continuously endorsed calls for retribution against those involved in January 6 prosecutions \u2014 specifically jurors, judges, and law enforcement \u2014 all whom help make up the D.C. community.\" They wrote that Young \"has also mocked officer victims,\" many of whom \"will, once again, be tasked in protecting the Capitol and Constitution on January 20, 2025.\" The judge has not ruled on Young's request.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant who is serving as his own defense lawyer, also requested permission to attend the inauguration. In a filing on Saturday, Pope said, \"I now move the Court for permission to travel to Washington, D.C. for the purpose of attending the Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2025. Initially, I had declined an invitation to attend the inauguration (since I don't enjoy being in Washington), however, I have now been asked a second time, and I believe it would be inappropriate for me to turn this request down.\"",
      "Pope has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in May. The court filing did not specify who invited Pope to be in attendance. The Justice Department has not yet responded to the request.",
      "Trump has pledged to pardons at least some of those charged or convicted with crimes related to Jan. 6.\u00a0 According to the latest Justice Department report, approximately 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty. Roughly 600 have been charged with assaulting or resisting police. There are several fugitives being sought by federal agents, with more arrests still expected.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Biden administration imposed new sanctions on Russian and Iranian entities over their attempts to interfere in the 2024 election, the Treasury and State Departments announced Tuesday.",

    "summary": "The Federal Vacancies Reform Act sets the rules for presidents to tap acting officials to fill vacancies throughout the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to begin his second term in the White House in just a few weeks, he has suggested that he will use recess appointments to circumvent the Senate confirmation process and quickly install his picks to key positions across the federal government.",
      "The demand has been met with pushback from some Republicans, but there is another way in which Trump could place those loyal to him in high-ranking positions without Senate approval, albeit temporarily: a 25-year-old federal law that sets the rules for presidents to tap acting officials to fill vacant positions that require Senate confirmation.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, or the Vacancies Act, limits which government employees can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and approval by the Senate.",
      "The playbook wouldn't be new to Trump, who installed \"acting\" leaders atop various federal agencies and subagencies in his first term, including the Departments of Defense and Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Some of the president-elect's nominees are likely to face headwinds in the GOP-led Senate, like Pete Hegseth, his pick to lead the Pentagon and Tulsi Gabbard, who he plans to tap for director of national intelligence. The Vacancies Act could become a key tool for Trump to ensure agencies are staffed with those loyal to him and his agenda.",
      "\"Congress has made the policy choice to have about 1,300 positions still require Senate consent,\" said Thomas Berry, a legal scholar at the Cato Institute. \"But what we have now is that any given time, half or more than half of those are filled not by Senate-confirmed people, not because Congress made that policy choice, but because the Vacancies Act can be pushed to the limit and maybe even beyond its limits, and it's so easy to have acting officers or sub-delegates essentially act in exactly the same way they would if they were Senate confirmed for years at a time.\"",
      "How the Vacancies Act works",
      "Under the Vacancies Act, there are three categories of federal workers who can temporarily fill a position covered by the law:",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant officeAnother administration official who has already won Senate confirmationAn agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office",
      "Another administration official who has already won Senate confirmation",
      "An agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The Vacancies Act also sets a time limit for how long an acting official can serve, allowing them to fill the position for 300 days when installed at the beginning of a new administration. Temporary leaders elevated after the start of a term can remain in their role for 210 days, but that cap can be extended if a nomination is pending in the Senate. If a nomination is rejected, returned or withdrawn, the president gets another 210 days.",
      "When Trump took office after he was inaugurated the first time in January 2017, he tapped noncontroversial, longtime civil servants to serve in acting roles while the confirmation process played out, Berry said. He could do the same again for the first days or weeks after he returns to the White House on Jan. 20.",
      "But Berry said the landscape will shift as Trump's second term progresses. Eventually, there will be Senate-confirmed officials in lower-level positions and those at the highest pay grade who have served in their agencies for more than 90 days. Those officials could be then tapped for acting positions.",
      "\"The vacancies people should be more concerned about, the vacancies where Trump has a lot more flexibility, are the ones that occur in the middle of the term, not right on day one,\" he said.",
      "Presidents of both parties have installed acting officials in high-ranking positions in their administrations. But with 30 acting secretaries, Trump used more temporary leaders than those who were confirmed during his first four years in the White House, according to research from Anne Joseph O'Connell, a law professor at Stanford University who has extensively studied the Vacancies Act.",
      "How much Trump relies on the 1998 law in the early months of his second term could depend on his legislative priorities. With a Republican-controlled Congress, the president-elect and GOP lawmakers have said they plan to focus on extending Trump's signature tax reform law, portions of which are set to expire next year, as well as border security. And if a member of the Supreme Court retires, filling that seat would also be a significant priority while Republicans have a Senate majority.",
      "\"I assume, given the threat to use the recess appointments clause, that the Senate party leadership is going to work closely with the White House to get the Cabinet or most confirmed quickly through the traditional process, so then the question is, what else will the Senate make a priority?\" O'Connell said. \"The Vacancies Act offers a second-best pathway for filling agency positions.\"",
      "Since winning the White House in November, Trump has rolled out a slew of personnel picks, ranging from those who will serve in his Cabinet if nominated and confirmed by the Senate to candidates for ambassadorships to senior White House staff who do not require Senate approval. One of those candidates, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, whom the president-elect selected for attorney general, took himself out of consideration after he came under renewed scrutiny for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he denied.",
      "While much of the focus is on Trump's picks for the most senior roles in his new administration, the leaders of subagencies could be filled through the Vacancies Act or through a delegation of duties to subordinates.",
      "\"That strategy can be done at these very influential positions that are just below the secretary level, and that's why you more often see pushing the boundaries of the Vacancies Act at that level,\" Berry said.",

The clip was widely shared during the 2016 presidential race. The court found that Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing that video to be shown.",
      "Carroll's federal civil lawsuit made claims of rape, sexual abuse and defamation as defined by New York's penal code. The jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but rejected the rape claim, which under New York's statute requires proof of forceful penetration involving the attacker's genitals.",
      "The judge later wrote that New York's penal code is out of touch with federal standards and a \"modern\" understanding of what rape is. In post-trial rulings he wrote that Carroll's assertion that Trump raped her was \"substantially true.\"",
      "\"The definition of rape in the New York Penal Law is far narrower than the meaning of 'rape' in common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote in July 2023",

      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",

      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",

      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth.

The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Some even use the term black moon to refer to every new moon, since at that phase, the illuminated face of the moon can't be seen from Earth.",

      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",

      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",

      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",

      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",

      "Those heading outside to catch the celestial show should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing northeast and look up. Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Viewers should also bring along a blanket or sleeping bag to help with the chilly January weather.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. They streak through the sky every night, and when Earth encounters many meteors at once, it's called a meteor shower. The meteors heat up as they pass through the atmosphere, making them look like shooting stars.",

    "story": [
      "December is coming to an end with a \"black moon\" on Monday night, Dec. 30, but those hoping to see the phenomenon will be out of luck.",
      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth. While new moons happen throughout the year, two new moons only fall in a single calendar month about once every 29 months, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "The moon will gradually become more visible in the coming days, reaching its first-quarter stage by Jan. 6 and becoming a full moon by Jan. 13, according to NASA.",
      "Those hoping to catch another black moon won't have to wait too long, as there are actually several types of black moons, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Some people use the term to refer to the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This type of black moon is rarer than the more common definition, occurring once every 33 months. The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Some even use the term black moon to refer to every new moon, since at that phase, the illuminated face of the moon can't be seen from Earth.",
      "Most months have one full moon and one new moon because the lunar calendar largely lines up with a calendar year. But just as it's possible for there to be two new moons in a single month, there can also be two full moons, with the second full moon in a single month considered a blue moon. Similar to how black moon can have more than one meaning, blue moon also refers to the third full moon in a season with four full moons.",
      "There are no monthly or seasonal blue moons in 2025, according to TimeAndDate.com. The next monthly blue moon is on May 31, 2026 and the next seasonal blue moon will fall on May 20, 2027, with dates varying depending on time zone.",

      "The upcoming year is poised to bring a packed schedule of astral shows, from lunar phenomena to planetary wonders that involve several of Earth's neighbors in the solar system. For skywatchers looking to mark their calendars, here are the top celestial events to watch in 2025.",
      "Jan. 3: Quadrantid meteor shower",
      "Next year's first astral spectacle comes early, on Jan. 3, when the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks. Considered one of the most impressive annual meteor showers to witness, the event can produce between 60 and 200 visible meteors under perfect weather conditions, according to NASA.",

      "The first full moon of 2025 is called the Wolf Moon. It's also a supermoon, set to appear in night skies Jan. 13, and will pass in front of Mars during a phenomenon known as occultation. People across the United States should be able to see the moon covering Mars before the red planet eventually shows itself again.",
      "March 14: Total lunar eclipse and Blood Moon",
      "A total lunar eclipse will occur March 14, the first of two in 2025 but the only one that will be visible in North America. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the moon and the sun, and for a time all three are perfectly aligned. The planet casts a shadow onto the moon and prevents most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "This eclipse coincides with the Blood Moon, where the moon bears a reddish hue. The phenomenon happens because some sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon during a total lunar eclipse, but in the case of a Blood Moon, only colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange, actually make it there.",
      "March 29: Partial solar eclipse",
      "A partial solar eclipse will take shape a couple weeks later, on March 29. Like the lunar eclipse preceding it, this is the first of two partial solar eclipses slated for 2025, but the only one that will be visible in North America next year.",
      "The opposite of a lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, casting its shadow onto the planet as it appears to cover the star. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen across the U.S. and Mexico last April, the moon completely blocks the sun's rays. A partial eclipse does not have the same effect, but people in some areas will be able to see the moon positioned in front of a portion of the sun.",
      "April 21: Lyrid meteor shower",
      "The Lyrid meteor shower\u00a0is active from April 15 to April 30 next year, according to the American Meteorological Society. It is expected to peak between April 21 and April 22, with people in the Northern Hemisphere most likely to spot the sparkling display.",
      "Aug. 12-13: Perseid meteor shower",
      "The Perseid meteor shower\u00a0will peak between Aug. 12 and Aug. 13. Dubbed the \"best meteor shower of the year\" by NASA, this shower typically has the capacity to produce 50 to 100 visible meteors per hour when skies are clear enough to see them and they aren't overpowered by moonlight.",
      "Unfortunately, the American Meteorological Society notes the Perseids may not be as striking in 2025 because the shower is due to happen at the same time as a waning gibbous moon, and strong moonlight could hide as much as 75% of the meteors.",
      "Aug. 12: Venus-Jupiter conjunction",
      "The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter will fall into place around the time of the Perseids peak, Space.com reports. This alignment of two of the brightest planets in the solar system will bring Venus and Jupiter much closer to each other in the sky than they usually appear.",
      "Sept. 7: Total lunar eclipse",
      "The second total lunar eclipse of 2025 will fall on Sept. 7, according to NASA. People will be able to see it in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.",
      "Sept. 21: Partial solar eclipse",
      "Another partial solar eclipse is set for Sept. 21. This one will be visible in parts of Australia, in addition to Antarctica and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.",
      "Oct. 7, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4: Supermoons",
      "There will be three supermoons next fall, on Oct. 8, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. A supermoon happens when the full moon phase of the lunar cycle occurs while the moon is located at one of the closest points to Earth in its orbit. Because of the full moon's proximity to the planet, skywatchers tend to see a brighter and larger moon than they normally do. In 2025, the supermoon on Nov. 5 will appear particularly bright, since the moon will be nearest Earth at that time.",
      "Dec. 13-14: Geminid meteor shower",

      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \"Hey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",

      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",

      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.

That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",

    "story": [
      "Decorated Army Special Forces Master Sgt. Matthew Livelsberger had an 8-month-old daughter at home and a new assignment involving drones that friends said excited him. He wrote glowing Yelp reviews praising the tattoo parlor in his Colorado Springs hometown and touting the benefits of float spas. And when his father last spoke with him on Christmas Day, he told CBS News, all seemed normal.",
      "He \"loved the Army and loved America,\" Roger Livelsberger said.",
      "Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was on holiday leave from his station in Germany and his father had figured he would be returning to Germany. He said nothing with his son seemed amiss.",
      "Days later, though, Matthew Livelsberger would rent a Tesla Cybertruck, purchase two firearms, take a meandering 1,000-mile drive from Denver to Las Vegas, and place himself at the center of one of two concussive New Year's Day attacks. What led him there remains, at least for now, a frustrating mystery to those who knew him, and to those investigating the attack.",
      "\"Obviously, we're always concerned in these sorts of events to ascertain what the motive is,\" said Spencer Evans, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Las Vegas Division. \"We understand that's at the forefront of everyone's thoughts, and so looking into exactly what the motivation is remains our number one priority.\"",
      "Figuring out what drove Livelsberger to explode a ragtag cache of fireworks and fuel tanks in front of the Trump Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip is not only a priority for law enforcement. It is also a question that has left his family and friends with heavy hearts and a yearning for answers.",
      "Livelsberger's history offers few immediate clues.",
      "A football star in high school in Bucyrus, Ohio, he enlisted with the Army after high school through a program called 18xray that allows applicants to train to be in the Special Forces without prior military experience.",
      "He served multiple tours in Afghanistan and even started a charitable drive to bring toys to children there.",
      "In 2010, he helped resettle a former Afghan interpreter he had served with in Afghanistan. CBS News spoke with the interpreter who said that Livelsberger was very kind to him and his family, and would often come to their house for meals, although not for many years.",
      "Livelsberger was divorced from his first wife, remarried and had an 8-month-old child with his second wife. She continued to live in Colorado Springs and he traveled back and forth from Germany.",
      "People who served with Livelsberger described him as a kind person who went above and beyond. One described him as an \"idealist\" and a real hero in his continued service to the country, including 5 tours in Afghanistan; Livelsberger, he said, had a \"remarkable\" military career.",
      "\"The American people still don't understand that quality of quantifying that service \u2014 someone could say they went to Afghanistan, but what did they really do?\" this servicemember said. In Livelsberger's case, he said, \"on a Special Forces team at the far fringes of U.S. support, operating with a lot of trust, very little direction, and make it happen, constantly in harm's way.\"",
      "The U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, are a small but elite special operations force inside the U.S. military. Officially founded in 1952, their roots trace to the World War II missions carried out by the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the CIA. Small teams of Green Berets, known as Operational Detachment Alphas, are trained to carry out specialized missions from counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare to combat raids and special reconnaissance missions. \"De Oppresso Liber,\" is their Latin motto: \"To Free the Oppressed.\"",
      "The close-knit Green Beret community has been left reeling in the aftermath of the Cybertruck explosion. Numerous former Green Berets spoke to CBS News to express their dismay over Livelsberger's actions.",
      "Many spoke of his accolades as a soldier and how he was a \"stand-up guy.\" Others, shocked by the news, didn't believe him to be involved \u2014 that perhaps someone had stolen Livelsberger's identity, they conjectured. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on Thursday confirmed that Livelsberger was positively identified as the driver of the Tesla Cybertruck. His death was ruled a suicide by the Clark County Office of the Coroner. Authorities said he shot himself in the head prior to the vehicle explosion at the Trump International Hotel and that they recovered a handgun at his feet.",
      "According to his LinkedIn profile, Livelsberger previously served in Tajikistan and received the Department of State Meritorious Honor Award there for services at the Embassy. Now, the seemingly sterling r\u00e9sum\u00e9 left only questions.",
      "Those answers may yet come, law enforcement officials said Thursday, with aid from those who knew Livelsberger best.",
      "\"We have to focus on what we know and what we don't know,\" the FBI's Evans said at a press conference Thursday. \"We know we have a bombing and it's a bombing that certainly has factors that raise concerns. It's not lost on us that it's in front of the Trump building, that it's a Tesla vehicle, but we don't have information at this point that definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular ideology, or any of the reasoning behind it.

      "The Cybertruck pulled up to the glass entrance of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas a little after 7:30 a.m., and exploded about 15 seconds later.",
      "The sheriff told reporters that gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were discovered in the back of the truck, although it was unclear exactly how the explosives were ignited.",
      "McMahill called the explosion \"an isolated incident\" and said there was no indication it was connected to ISIS. The blast came just hours after a man intentionally\u00a0drove a pickup truck flying a black ISIS flag\u00a0into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "The Las Vegas sheriff reiterated Thursday that the two incidents were unrelated, although he acknowledged some similarities between the cases and subjects. The drivers in both the Cybertruck explosion and the New Orleans rampage had rented their respective vehicles using the company Turo, and both were members of the U.S. military.

    "summary": "Vehicles used in deadly New Orleans attack and Las Vegas explosion at Trump hotel were rented via same app, Turo.",
    "story": [
      "The vehicles used in two separate incidents, the deadly New Orleans attack and the explosion in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, were rented via the same app, a peer-to-peer service called Turo, the company said.",
      "Authorities are looking into several parallels between the incidents, including that both involved trucks \u2014 a Ford pickup in New Orleans and Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 were rented from Turo and occurred on New Year's Day. Both also involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe, but don't appear to have any known connections.",
      "But on Thursday, an FBI official, Christopher Raia, said that at this point, there's \"no definitive link\" between the two occurrences.",
      "In an email to CBS News, a Turo spokesperson said the company is \"actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.\"",
      "They added, \"We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Turo operates similarly to Airbnb, but with cars instead of houses or apartments. Car owners who aren't using their vehicles can rent them out to others via the app, which handles screening, billing and other services. In some cases, individuals have become \"professional hosts\" by renting out fleets of cars via Turo, according to a company filing.",
      "In a separate email to CBS MoneyWatch, a Turo spokesperson said, \"We are outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Turo.",
      "How many people use Turo?",
      "Turo, which started in 2009, had about 150,000 active hosts who rented out about 350,000 vehicles as of Sept. 30, according to the company's filing. About 3.5 million people rented those cars in the 12-month period through the end of September, it added.",
      "The car rental service operates in 16,000 cities in the U.S., Australia, France, the U.K. and Canada.",
      "How do you rent a car on Turo?",
      "Turo says that in order to use its service, individuals need an email address, Google account or Apple ID, and a valid driver's license. Renters must also provide a home address and payment card.",
      "Customers must be at least 18 years old to rent a car on Turo, or over 25 for more expensive vehicles. For instance, to rent a \"deluxe\" car \u2014 those valued between $45,000 to $85,000 \u2014 drivers must be older than 25. \"Super deluxe\" cars, or those valued over $85,000, are limited to people over 30.",
      "Does Turo screen people who rent cars?",
      "On its website, Turo says \"We may ask for additional photos and information and/or may check your personal and/or business credit report, auto insurance score, and criminal background to verify your account.\"",
      "The man who drove the Ford truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges tied to driving under the influence (DUI), according to CNN.",
      "In the state of Louisiana, a DUI offense is considered a felony on third and subsequent convictions,\u00a0according to Louisiana Court Records, although first-time DUI offenders can face felony charges in instances where a death or violation of child endangerment laws is involved.",
      "Turo also says it relies on its proprietary \"risk score\" to assess potential renters, which relies on \"more than 50 data inputs,\" such as information submitted by customers as well as parameters set by the car owner.",
      "\"Every Turo renter is screened through a proprietary multilayer, data science-based trust and safety process,\" the Turo spokesperson wrote to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"These individuals in question had valid driver's licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military,\" the spokesperson added. \"They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain. We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\"",
      "Who are the men who rented the cars used in the attacks?",
      "The driver in the New Orleans attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas, was a U.S. Army veteran who lived in Houston. The FBI said he posted several videos before the attack proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck from Turo in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove the vehicle to New Orleans on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, he bypassed barriers put in place on Bourbon Street, which included patrol cars and law enforcement, before plowing onto the sidewalk, according to police officials. The attack killed at least 14 people and injured dozens.",
      "In the second Jan. 1 occurrence, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany but on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, rented a Tesla Cybertruck from Turo in Denver.",
      "That Cybertruck, a 2024 model, pulled up to the Trump hotel's glass entrance doors on Wednesday morning, officials said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred. Gasoline and camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building.",
      "The Cybertruck explosion, which is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, killed the driver of the car and injured seven people outside of the vehicle.",
      "The body was \"burnt beyond recognition,\" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a briefing Thursday, but the coroner's office later confirmed it was Livelsberger. Investigators said Livelsberger's military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on X, his social media app, that the vehicle's structure helped limit the damage.",
      "\"The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Musk. \"Cybertruck actually contained the explosion and directed the blast upwards.   Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken.\"",

      "An orca who made headlines in 2018 after she carried her dead calf\u00a0for more than two weeks was again spotted carrying the body of her newborn, just days after researchers confirmed she'd given birth.",
      "J35, a southern resident killer whale also known as Tahlequah, carried her child's body on her head for 17 days across a distance of 1,000 miles in 2018, according to the Center for Whale Research. In December, the center determined Tahlequah had given birth again, identifying the newborn girl as J61.",
      "\"New Year's Eve 2024 was a day of extreme highs and lows,\" the center wrote in a Wednesday social media post. \"We have confirmation of another new calf in J pod, but sadly, this was combined with the devastating news that J61 has not survived.\"",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it believes J61 only lived about a week and has been dead for a few days.",
      "While it's not common, J35 isn't the only whale to have carried a dead calf, Dr. Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research told CBS News.",
      "\"What made J35's case in 2018 unusual was how long she carried the calf for,\" Weiss said. \"It's interesting that it's the same whale doing this behavior again; it does seem to suggest that there's something about her as an individual that makes this behavior more prominent. We don't know what that would be.\"",
      "In 2020, experts were excited when J35 gave birth to another calf because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth.",
      "But after J35 gave birth to J61 late last year, the Center for Whale Research said last month it was worried for the calf's health based on the behavior of both the calf and the mother.",
      "\"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year,\" the center, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, wrote in a social media post.",
      "The Center for Whale Research did not specify what sparked the concern, but the Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media last year that researchers believed J61 was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said at the time that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",
      "The Center for Whale Research did share the good news that the newborn calf spotted on New Year's Eve \"appeared physically and behaviorally normal.\" The new calf has been identified as J62. Researchers do not yet know J62's gender or who J62's mother is.",
      "Southern resident killer whales are the only endangered population of killer whales in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. There were 72 southern resident killer whales counted during the 2020 census, though several calves have been born since then. A recovery plan was completed in 2008, but the population continues to struggle and has declined over 10% since 2005.",
      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves. We continue to advocate for salmon recovery through habitat restoration, removal of dams, and rational management of fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.\"",

Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",

    "summary": "President Biden delivered remarks from the White House highlighting the 235 judges confirmed by the Senate during his single term in office.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Thursday marked the 235 judicial confirmations he secured during his single term in the White House, a figure that surpasses that of his predecessor, President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Joined by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, Mr. Biden delivered remarks from the White House highlighting the judges that he had nominated and the Democrat-led Senate confirmed to the federal bench.",
      "\"They represent the best of America,\" the president said of his nominees.",
      "Mr. Biden underscored how judges shape many aspects of American life, from voting rights to workers rights to environmental rules, and said he is proud of his administration's impact on the federal courts.",
      "\"Judges matter, shaping the everyday lives of Americans, protecting our basic freedoms ... defending constitutional liberties, respecting the idea that precedent matters,\" he said. \"These judges will be independent, they'll be fair, and they'll be impartial and respect the rule of law. And most importantly \u2014 I never thought I'd be saying this \u2014 they'll uphold the Constitution.\"",
      "The president's judicial record includes one appointment to the Supreme Court, 45 to the federal courts of appeals, 187 to the U.S. district courts and two to the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Mr. Biden's pick of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court was historic, as she is the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court.",
      "\"The record is clear: the nominees of President Joseph Biden to the federal bench represent the best of the judiciary, the best of America,\" Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in brief remarks.",
      "One out of every four judges now on the federal bench were nominated by Mr. Biden, he said.",
      "Schumer called the 235 appointments \"historic\" and said the president's judicial picks \"will be a barrier against attacks on our democratic institutions.\"",
      "\"When people look back at the most consequential accomplishments of the last four years, two things will stand out: the legislation we passed between 2021 and 2022, and the historic judges we confirmed to the bench,\" the Democratic leader said, adding that Mr. Biden's picks \"will be the shield that protects our democracy\" and \"one of the most important hallmarks of your legacy.\"",
      "Since the start of his administration in 2021, the president, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was in the upper chamber, had pledged to diversify the federal bench by appointing judges from varying professional and personal backgrounds. Mr. Biden's judicial nominees included more than 45 public defenders, including Jackson, and 25 civil rights attorneys.",
      "In addition to tapping the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Mr. Biden also named more Black women to the federal courts of appeals than every previous presidential administration combined, according to the White House.",
      "The 235 judicial confirmations marks the largest number in a four-year term since the late President Jimmy Carter was in office and surpasses Trump's appointments to the federal bench by one. Carter did not appoint any justices to the Supreme Court, but selected a record 262 judges to the federal courts after Congress in 1978 passed legislation creating 35 new appeals court judgeships and 117 district court seats.",
      "Trump, though, named three justices to the Supreme Court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority, and 54 judges to the federal appeals courts.",
      "The 13 courts of appeals hear more than 40,000 cases annually and typically issue the final decision in a legal dispute given that the Supreme Court hears fewer than 100 cases each year.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a near-six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him. It's the latest confrontation in a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.",
      "The country's anti-corruption agency said it withdrew its investigators after the presidential security service blocked them from entering Yoon's residence for hours due to concerns about their safety.",
      "The agency said its outnumbered investigators had several scuffles with presidential security forces and expressed \"serious regret about the attitude of the suspect, who did not comply with the legal process.\"",
      "The National Police Agency said it planned to investigate the chief and deputy chiefs of the presidential security service on suspicion of obstructing official duty and summoned them for questioning on Saturday.",
      "Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.",
      "Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon's detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence.",
      "Yoon's lawyers, who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday, say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "The office said it will discuss further actions, but did not immediately say whether it would make another attempt to detain Yoon. The warrant for his detention is valid for one week.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have also argued that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. They said police officers don't have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon, and could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens.\" They didn't elaborate further on the claim.",
      "If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, called the anti-corruption agency's withdrawal regrettable and urged the agency to make another attempt to detain Yoon on Friday.",
      "Kwon Young-se, who heads the emergency leadership committee of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, called the agency's effort to detain Yoon \"highly unfair and exceedingly improper,\" saying there is no risk of Yoon attempting to flee or to destroy evidence.",
      "Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon's residence on Friday, forming a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters who braved freezing temperatures for hours, waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans vowing to protect him. There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence.",
      "Dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon's detention, but the dramatic scene quickly developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il, were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. It wasn't immediately clear what the lawyers discussed with the president.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, another lawyer on Yoon's legal team, said the agency's efforts to detain Yoon were \"reckless\" and showed an \"outrageous discard for law.\"",
      "South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence's grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service, which controls the residence itself, refused to comment. South Korea's YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces.",
      "As the standoff progressed, the Democrats called on the country's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn't immediately comment on the situation.",
      "\"Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,\" said Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must \"remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility,\" Jo said.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.",
      "Yoon's presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon's fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor to remove him from office.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting president after Yoon's powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court's review of Yoon's case.",

    "summary": "China's Ministry of Commerce adds 28 U.S. entities to export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:12:27 -0500",
    "summary": "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found matching dinosaur footprints on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "Last year, engineers working to prevent flooding on a beach in the U.K. made a \"dramatic discovery\" of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "story": [
      "A rare collection of ancient coins was discovered last week by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins are more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty that presided over Judea in the final centuries leading up to the common era, according to the University of Haifa in Israel.",
      "Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during ongoing excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan. The project is headed by researchers at the University of Haifa and the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, the university\u00a0said in a news release translated from Hebrew.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed Friday, coinciding with the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "Each coin bears inscriptions that include an eight-pointed star and the phrase \"King Alexander 25\" written in Aramaic, one of the world's oldest known languages that originated in the region around what's now Syria and is closely related to both Arabic and Hebrew. These types of coins date back to about 80 B.C.E., according to the University of Haifa.",
      "\"The site where the treasure was discovered is, apparently, a way station, which had not been recognized in research until now,\" said Shai Bar, one of the leaders of the excavation, in a statement to the university. Bar said the station included a purification bath, used for religious ritual, and a water storage area in addition to other buildings. It's located along a main road leading to the Alexandrion fortress, built atop a mountain in the Jordan Valley by Alexander Jannaeus.",
      "Bar told the university that students and volunteers were involved in the dig that uncovered the monarch's ancient coins. He said they were particularly excited to find the trove during Hanukkah.",
      "\"This added special meaning to the holiday for them, including in the difficult days our people are going through at the moment,\" Bar said. \"I hope that the place will become a site that attracts a crowd, and will be added to the archaeological and heritage sites of our country.\"",

    "summary": "If 12 grapes are eaten at the stroke of midnight, Spanish tradition holds good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
    "story": [
      "Can grapes bring you luck? Spaniards believe so, and at midnight on New Year's Eve all across the country it's a race to gobble 12 grapes all before the first minute of the year passes.",
      "The 12 grapes, which stand for the months of the year, need to be eaten one by one before the clock changes to 12:01. If the grapes are consumed, the tradition states good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
      "Where does the tradition of eating 12 grapes come from?",
      "The origins of the \"uvas de la suerte\" tradition\u00a0are hard to trace. The idea might have begun with grape farmers in Alicante, Spain, to unload a surplus in the early 1900s, reported Atlas Obscura. Grapes are a reasonably priced crop that tends to fare well, and there are often surpluses so the fruit can be brought cheaply.",
      "Or it might have been Madrid's bourgeoisie copying the French tradition of having grapes and champagne on the last day of the year, NPR reported. But the story goes that the Madrid residents wanted to rebel against class distinctions and decided to mock aristocrats by going to Puerta del Sol to eat grapes accompanied by the sound of the bells.",
      "Whatever the beginnings were, the tradition has caught on like wildfire in Spain. Supermarket chains such as Mercadona and Super Sol advertise and sell \"uvas de la suerte\" across Spain.",
      "Mercadona, one of Spain's largest grocery chains, advertised four ways to purchase grapes for the occasion. Natural bunch grapes with seeds from Alicante add \"an element of fun to the tradition of the 12 grapes.\" The seeds provide a \"crunchy touch,\" the supermarket said. Consumers can also buy grapes without seeds, or prepackaged grapes \"specially selected and packaged with the exact amount needed for each chime.\"",
      "Prepackaged grapes allow revelers to open the grapes at the precise moment the clock changes and not worry about counting or peeling the grapes in the midst of the excitement of the celebration.",
      "Grapes can also be bought peeled and pitted in a can. These grapes are among the most popular for Spaniards due to their convenience, the supermarket said.",
      "What are the exact rules for the New Year's grape tradition?",
      "Regardless of how the grapes are purchased, eating them at midnight on Nochevieja is key to celebrating\u00a0in Spain. Celebrants need to eat the grapes before the clock chimes 12:01 a.m., and if consumed in full, tradition holds that good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
      "Spaniards commonly choose green grapes for this tradition.",
      "Where did the idea of eating grapes under the table come from?",
      "Eating grapes under a table isn't part of the original tradition from Spain, but may be a 21st-century twist spreading on social media. TikTok users posted on social media and said they were eating 12 grapes \u2014 either red or green \u2014 under a table, in the hopes that single people who eat the grapes under a table on New Year's will soon fall in love.",

      "In the past, drug cartels in Mexico have often handed out gifts or bags of food to local people around the holidays, to try to improve their image or build local support. The cartels often want local people to warn them of army raids, but at the same time the gangs usually extort protection money from local residents.",
      "Videos posted on social media last week from the town of Coalcoman, in the western state of Michoacan, showed a sign at a Christmas fair thanking Jalisco cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera -- better known by his nickname \"El Mencho\" -- for the gifts.",
      "\"The children of Coalcoman thank Mr. Nemesio Oseguera and his sons, 2, 3, and Delta 1, for their noble gesture. Thank for your gifts,\" the sign read.",
      "A person speaking over a loudspeaker repeated that message, but it was unclear how much local officials were involved in or aware of the message, or whether they had approved of it. Such fairs are often in part organized by civic, neighborhood or other groups.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that local officials were being investigated for any possible links to the sign.",
      "\"Obviously we condemn these signs,\" she said. \"A criminal group cannot hold a public event to promote the acceptance of violence.\"",

      "\"El Mencho\" has also been indicted in the United States and the State Department just this month increased a reward to\u00a0$15 million\u00a0for his capture.

The cartels have also obliged some local residents to join demonstrations against army operations.",
      "The Mexican government's policy of not confronting the cartels has often left local officials in the uncomfortable position of having to deal with the local gangs, and even in some cases, hand over part of the municipal budget to them.",
      "Sometimes local officials are even implicated In murders. Just last month, former prosecutor and local police official Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested in connection with the grisly\u00a0decapitation of a mayor\u00a0on Oct. 6.

      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants. He's ignored repeated requests by investigative authorities to appear for questioning, and the presidential security service has blocked attempts to search his office and residence citing a law that bans raids on sites with state secrets.",

      "The German government, under fire for failing to prevent a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market, said Monday that the tragedy would have been hard to prevent and said that the suspect appeared to be mentally disturbed.",
      "Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, along with security and intelligence chiefs, faced questioning by a parliamentary committee about the attack and on whether there had been missed clues and security lapses. Five people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Dec. 20 attack in the eastern city of Magdeburg.",
      "Faeser said no motive had yet been established but \"there are striking signs of a pathological psyche\" in the suspect, a Saudi-born doctor who had lived in Germany for years.",
      "She added that lessons must be learned about how to track potential attackers who don't fit conventional threat categories and who \"are psychologically disturbed and... driven by confused conspiracy theories.\"",
      "The minister argued that \"such attackers do not fit any threat profile\" \u2014 such as far-right extremist or Islamist \u2014 and warned that German security services will need \"other indicators and action plans\" to deal with them in future.",

The attacker was killed in a shootout days later. That same year, ISIS claimed responsibility after another attacker killed 86 people in a truck rampage in the\u00a0French city of Nice.",
      "Abdulmohsen, by contrast, has in the past voiced strongly anti-Islam views and sympathies with the far right in his social media posts, as well as anger at Germany for allowing in too many Muslim war refugees and other asylum-seekers.",

      "\"That explains why not everything is on the table yet,\" she said. \"Who knew about which clues and what was passed on when must be carefully clarified.\"",
      "Reuters reported that he posted rambling commentary on X, among other things blaming Germany's supposed liberalism for the death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, and accusing police of stealing a USB stick from him and destroying a criminal complaint he had filed.",
      "Abdulmohsen, 50, is the only suspect in the attack in which a rented BMW sport utility vehicle plowed through the crowd of revelers at high speed, leaving a bloody trail of carnage.",
      "He has been remanded in custody on five counts of murder and 205 counts of attempted murder, prosecutors said, but so far not on terrorism-related charges.",
      "The state premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, described it at the time as \"a lone attack.\"",
      "According to media reports citing unnamed German security sources, the suspect had in the past been treated for mental illness and tested positive for drug use on the night of his arrest.

Guys, honestly like, t-minus two years from now, good luck finding any job, because the studios will have a technology \u2026 it\u2019s already basically here.\"",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "\"Imagine if you will, not only will every studio have possessed this technology, but then they\u2019ll go to you and say, \u2018Hey as a part of your HBO Max subscription you can pay ten extra dollars, and you get to use the creator sandbox, and in there, you can make your own movies. And you can type in anything that\u2019s a Warner Brothers asset, so it can be Shazam and Batman and Neo from \u2018The Matrix,\u2019 and you can type in all these characters, and you want them to go on a treasure hunt on Mars and I want it to feel like a Stephen Spielberg movie, go.\u2019 And then it will make that movie, and it will look indiscernible from human-made, in fact it will look amazing. And it will be entirely animated, but it will look like real life. This is where we\u2019re about to be.\"",
      "The \"Tangled\" star mentioned that he is working on his own studio to stay ahead of the curve, saying, \"Right now, the studio I\u2019m trying to build feels very much like the ark that God was telling Noah, \u2018You gotta go build this thing, because the flood is coming.\u2019\"",
      "When asked by host George Janko why he wanted to continue working in entertainment if AI poses such a threat, Levi focused on the power of the human element.",

Most people think, \u2018Yeah, but I\u2019m never going to want a computer-generated movie.\u2019 If we\u2019re being super-altruistic, obviously, but if a human-made movie still costs you twenty bucks, but for two bucks you can make a movie where you, by the way you get to scan your own face and your own voice and you get to be Superman or, better yet your kid gets to be Superman, and now you can shut them up for the next couple hours for two bucks and watch themselves be Superman in the movie, you are absolutely going to pay for that movie.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t think the flood is water. Honestly, I think the flood is AI.\"",
      "The \"Chuck\" star also pointed out that he\u2019s facing new competition from actors of the past whose likenesses may be signed away by their families. He explained a hypothetical situation where Gene Kelly\u2019s descendants could sell the rights to the star\u2019s likeness. \"And then all of a sudden we\u2019re going to get to watch Gene Kelly movies again. Like how insane! And again, I don\u2019t want to support that, but are you kidding me?! . . . Like a new \u2018Singing in the Rain\u2019 sequel? I want to watch that, take my money!\"",

It is not, \u2018Oh that\u2019s fun,\u2019 or some passing fad or whatever. It is going to replace so many jobs, and it\u2019s going to happen way faster than you think it\u2019s going to happen,\" he said.",

So, we\u2019re not going to stop this flood. We can only build levees and dams and channels and things to try to make sure we\u2019re guiding it in the best possible way. There\u2019s still going to be casualties, there\u2019s still going to be a lot of people who get hurt in the process, unfortunately.

      "\"Ultimately, and this is part of the reason why I want to build, why I feel like I need to build the campus, or campuses plural if I can do multiple, is because I think that really, as humans, what we want to be focusing on are just, there\u2019s two areas of vocation that mean anything anymore, moving into the future, and that\u2019s creation and discovery.\"",
      "He that added AI will still be a tool used in creation and discovery, but those two things are what \"stimulates the human heart, mind, and soul, and I think as long as we really hold onto lots of places for people to work, because work is not just a matter of making income. Work is purpose. How many people retire, and they die just a few years after they retire, and why? Because they have nothing to do. They literally are sedentary, and we\u2019re already sedentary a lot, and now they\u2019re super-sedentary, and now they don\u2019t have any purpose, and they die.\"",

      "\"Doom-scrolling\" on social media is a potentially addictive behavior, the psychologist noted. (iStock)",
      "Social media is another form of addiction, the expert said.",
      "\"When your phone buzzes or pings, you don't know what's there, so it\u2019s a novelty that's interesting, and it releases dopamine,\" he said. \"You almost literally cannot help yourself.\"",
      "Identifying the \u2018hooks\u2019",
      "Many people assume that the behavior itself is the problem, Jaffe said \u2014 but there is almost always an underlying reason for those unhealthy or harmful choices.",
      "\"The behavior was actually a medicine of sorts for a problematic undercurrent.\"",
      "\"The reason you do it is that at some point earlier in your life, there was pain or struggle or emotional discomfort,\" he said.",

      "More than a third of Americans report making New Year\u2019s resolutions, statistics show, many of which are focused on kicking bad habits. (iStock)",
      "For Jaffe, when he was 14 or 15 years old, his \"hook\" was social anxiety.",

      "\"We start living our lives trying to escape the discomfort of the hooks,\" he said.",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"We try to stop ourselves from doing what we don't like,\" he noted. \"Especially around New Year\u2019s, people might say, \u2018I'm going to stop eating bad foods or I'm going to stop being lazy.\u2019\"",

      "For example, if someone wants to quit smoking, they might keep gum or sunflower seeds in their pocket, he said.",
      "\"You just have to keep going.\"",
      "Or, if someone is too focused on work, that might mean letting go of some tasks and delegating them to other people.",

Trump's first term as president saw multiple attacks carried out by individuals pledging allegiance to ISIS or other jihad groups\u2014even if they had not been operating at the direction of the group itself.

      "Several \"winners\" and \"losers\" emerged in 2024 as the year comes to a close after Republicans took control of Congress in the November election and several prominent Democrats ended up on the losing side.",
      "WINNER -\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump",
      "Pundits in the media largely wrote Trump off after he left office and argued his political career was over in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and House impeachments. That critique intensified after he found himself facing indictments in several different jurisdictions and battling with several prominent Republicans during the GOP primary.",
      "However, Trump weathered the political storm while surviving two assassination attempts and won back the White House in November in what\u00a0many described as the greatest political comeback in American political history.",

      "Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Jan. 20 for a term that will be bolstered by Republican control of the House and Senate for at least the next two years.",
      "LOSER -\u00a0VP Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz",
      "President Biden made history this summer when he dropped out of the presidential race amid pressure from many within his own party and essentially handed the reins to his vice president despite calls to hold an open primary process.",
      "After several months of campaigning along with a spending blitz of $1 billion, Harris ultimately failed to make the case to voters that the Biden-Harris administration policies should be continued with four years of a Harris presidency.",
      "Harris lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College to Trump, and Republicans down the ballot secured enough seats to keep control of the House and retake control of the Senate.",

      "Harris was\u00a0widely criticized for her decision to select Walz as her running mate, with many political experts making the case that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was the optimal choice. Walz had been labeled by many media outlets as a personable and popular governor who brought \"Midwestern charm\" to the ticket but also consistently brought negative attention to the campaign with a series of gaffes and controversial statements about his past military service.",
      "\"Historically, vice presidents have little impact on a presidential candidate\u2019s fate,\" Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of the Daily Signal, told Fox News Digital last month.",
      "\"But in the case of Tim Walz, it proved to be a disastrous decision that doomed Kamala Harris from the moment she made it. Not only was Walz ill-prepared for the national spotlight and media scrutiny, but Harris passed over several better options. Given how little Americans knew about Harris or her policy positions, they were right to question her judgment on this big decision.\"",
      "WINNER -\u00a0Elon Musk",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO officially threw his support behind Trump shortly after the former president survived being shot during a failed assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.",
      "Musk quickly became a fixture on the campaign trail and spoke at a rally at the site of the assassination attempt.",
      "\"As you can see, I am not just MAGA. I am Dark MAGA,\" Musk joked at the rally in October, a nod to the Dark Brandon meme. He called the upcoming Nov. 5 election \"the most important election of our lifetime.\"",
      "Over the past few months, Musk has positioned himself as a key voice in the Trump administration and has been seen at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida several times \u2013 some outlets have reported that he is living on the property \u2013 and his influence has grown to the point that liberal pundits are accusing him of being the \"co-president.\"",
      "Musk, along with former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, was appointed by Trump to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which has already made waves in Washington, D.C., with elected officials on both sides of the aisle supporting the agency's stated goal of slashing government waste.",

      "When Proposition 47 passed in 2014, it downgraded most thefts from felonies to misdemeanors if the amount stolen was under $950, \"unless the defendant had prior convictions of murder, rape, certain sex offenses, or certain gun crimes.\"",

      "In another loss for Soros-backed prosecutors in the Golden State, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price\u00a0was recalled, less than two years after taking office, after backlash for her alleged soft-on-crime approach.",
      "Oakland Democrat Mayor Sheng Thao, who faced heat from her constituents amid rising crime, was also ousted from office after her recall effort passed with 65% of the vote.",
      "In San Francisco, where crime has been a major concern with voters, Democrat Mayor London Breed\u00a0lost her re-election campaign.",
      "\"I think that this is broader than just a message from people who care about crime,\" Cully Stimson, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation and co-author of the book \"Rogue Prosecutors: How Radical Soros Lawyers Are Destroying America's Communities,\" told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"I thought people would be more unnerved by JD Vance,\" MSNBC host Rachel Maddow told Semafor this week.",
      "Vance, 40, will be the third-youngest vice president in American history when he is sworn in next month. As Trump is prevented by the Constitution from seeking another term in office, Vance is already viewed as a front-runner for the 2028 Republican presidential nomination.",

      "In February, however, Biden\u2019s 81 years of age and mental acuity fell under public scrutiny after years of conservatives questioning the commander-in-chief\u2019s mental fitness. Special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"",

      "When the big debate day arrived, Biden missed his marks repeatedly, tripping over his responses and appearing to lose his train of thought as he squared up against Trump.

      "Fox News' Bret Baier has the latest on concerns over the retirement of the International Space Station on 'Special Report.'",
      "Before the International Space Station was launched into orbit in 1998, the U.S. signed a document with several other countries to agree to the peaceful use of the orbital laboratory. The agreement included Russia, Japan, Canada and 11 European countries. China was left out of the plan.",
      "Nearly a decade later, China expressed interest in joining those on board the space station. The European Space Agency signaled support for the addition, along with South Korea. The final decision was ultimately opposed by the United States.",

      "Melroy insists the agency will not let China be the sole operator of a space station in orbit, but the storyline resonates with that of the space shuttle program.",
      "The American-made space shuttle was the world\u2019s first reusable aircraft. It launched like a rocket and landed like an airplane. In 2004, then-President George W.

      "\"Pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy. In part, this is because the old strategy, including the Constellation program, was not fulfilling its promise in many ways,\" then-President Barack Obama said in April 2010.",
      "The administration instead directed more than $6 billion to support commercial companies building spacecraft. The shuttle program came to an end a year later. American-made rockets were still not yet available. The U.S. was forced to rely on Russia for continued space travel.",

We needed to make a strategic investment in our own industry to develop the capability to take humans to space,\" Melroy said. \"There were a lot of people who thought we'd canceled the space program.\"",
      "NASA would finally launch an American-made rocket that could carry humans to the space station, nine years after the shuttle\u2019s retirement. It was a delay of six years from Bush\u2019s initial projection. The 2020 SpaceX launch also marked the first of a commercial rocket on U.S. soil.",

      "The rise of international call scams",
      "International call scams have become increasingly common in recent years. One particularly prevalent scam is known as \"Wangiri,\" which originates from Japan and means \"one-ring-and-cut.\" These scammers typically let your phone ring once or twice before hanging up, hoping to pique your curiosity and prompt a callback.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Why are you receiving these international scam calls?",
      "There are several reasons why you might be receiving calls from unfamiliar international numbers.",
      "Wangiri scam: Scammers use automated systems to call thousands of numbers, disconnecting after one ring. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate number, incurring significant charges.",

      "Is your phone at risk?",
      "While receiving unexpected international calls doesn't necessarily put your phone at immediate risk, there are several potential dangers to be aware of.\u00a0The primary risk lies in potential financial losses if you engage with these scammers. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate service number owned by the fraudster. You could also be charged heavily for these calls, with the scammer aiming to keep you on the line to increase the billed amount.",
      "While less common with Wangiri scams, there's always a risk of personal information theft if you engage with unknown callers. Sharing sensitive data like bank account numbers or Social Security numbers could lead to identity theft.",
      "Answering or returning these calls may signal to scammers that your number is active, potentially leading to more scam calls in the future. Although not typically associated with Wangiri scams, some sophisticated phone scams can potentially install malware on your device if you click on certain links, prompts or follow instructions given by the scammer.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "1) Don't answer or call back: If you receive a call from an unknown international number, resist the urge to answer or return the call.",
      "2) Block suspicious numbers: Use your phone's built-in features to\u00a0block these numbers and prevent future calls.",
      "3) Report the calls: Inform your phone carrier and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about these suspicious calls.",
      "4) Use call-blocking apps: Consider installing\u00a0call-blocking apps to identify and block spam calls.",
      "5) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive data over the phone, especially with unfamiliar callers.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using services that remove your personal data from the internet, reducing the chances of scammers obtaining your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Using a\u00a0VPN service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously.

      "1) Unsolicited pop-ups claiming to be from Microsoft or other security services:\u00a0Janet\u2019s story highlights a common scam tactic, which is fake alerts masquerading as official warnings. Microsoft and other legitimate companies do not issue pop-ups with support numbers or direct you to download remote access software.",
      "2) Urgent audio and visual cues: Scammers create a sense of urgency with sirens, flashing messages and warnings of dire consequences to push victims into immediate action without thinking critically.",
      "3) Requests to install remote access software: Scammers often use tools like UltraViewer, TeamViewer or AnyDesk to gain access to victims\u2019 systems. While these tools are legitimate for remote tech support, downloading them at the request of an unknown party is a red flag.",

      "Why Janet didn\u2019t receive a warning from her antivirus software",
      "Janet also mentioned that her antivirus software didn\u2019t flag the scam. Unfortunately, many of these scams rely on social engineering rather than malware to bypass antivirus detection. They exploit human psychology, not just technical vulnerabilities. However, running regular scans can still help detect hidden threats.",

      "Stop all communication: Cease all contact with the scammer immediately. Do not engage further or respond to any messages or calls from them.",
      "Report the scam: Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or the cybercrime unit in your country. Provide them with all the information you have about the scammer and the communication you had with them.",
      "Notify your bank and credit card companies: If you shared any financial information, contact your bank and credit card companies right away. Inform them about the potential scam and ask for advice on how to secure your accounts.",
      "Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately.",
      "Inform credit bureaus: Consider contacting credit reporting agencies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent the scammer from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "Be cautious about future communications: Be vigilant regarding any future communications from unknown sources. Scammers may try to target you again using different tactics.",
      "Use identity theft protection: If a scammer gets a hold of your personal information, you may consider a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process. One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service. One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0Read more of my review of the best identity theft protection services here.",

By recognizing red flags like unsolicited pop-ups, high-pressure tactics and requests for remote access, you can protect yourself and your personal information. If you ever encounter a situation like Janet\u2019s, remember to stay calm, verify the legitimacy of any alerts and take the necessary steps to secure your system. Scammers rely on quick reactions, so slow down, stay in control and don\u2019t let them manipulate your next move.",

    "summary": "A new study says outdoor security camera apps are among the biggest collectors of user data, including phone numbers, payment details and precise location.",
    "story": [
      "More than 20 years later, the system is getting a makeover.",
      "Smart home cameras have become a necessity. You already know they help keep an eye on what\u2019s happening indoors and outdoors, even when you\u2019re not home.",
      "But while these cameras are undeniably useful, they also pose a privacy risk. A new study highlights outdoor security camera apps as some of the biggest collectors of user data.",
      "This includes sensitive personal information like email addresses, phone numbers, payment details, precise location and more.",

      "Smart outdoor camera\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How smart home cameras can be spying on you",
      "According to a\u00a0study conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That\u2019s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What\u2019s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity.",
      "Indoor security camera apps are slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn\u2019t actually necessary for the apps to do their job.",
      "Smart camera\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Which apps collect the most data?",

      "The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers. While outdoor security cameras typically avoid tracking, indoor cameras like Nooie and Canary Connect engage in user tracking, further complicating privacy concerns.",

      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "9 ways to stay safe from the risks associated with smart home cameras",
      "1. Limit data sharing:\u00a0Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information.",
      "2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:\u00a0Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It\u2019s important to regularly review the app\u2019s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren\u2019t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers.",
      "3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Make sure your camera\u2019s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible: This adds an extra layer of security in case your account information is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Be mindful of camera placement: If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture.",
      "6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it\u2019s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach.",
      "7. Use a VPN: Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "8. Regularly review privacy policies: Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information.",
      "9. Consider\u00a0home security systems with enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps:",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 08:00:33 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network (VPN) allows computer and smartphone users to mask an IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between a device and the internet.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful tool that allows you to mask your IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. This means you can browse the web more privately, especially when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Another use case for VPNs is accessing sites that are blocked in your region. For example, you could be sitting in New York and accessing content on Chinese social media platforms (though I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing that). However, a VPN can sometimes have the opposite effect, blocking you from accessing content that you were otherwise able to view.",
      "I recently received an email from Carol in Douglasville, Georgia, who asked:",
      "\"Why am I blocked from seeing a site when I use a VPN? I am being blocked from answering emails I receive from the VA, Social Security and government sites that I need to connect to concerning my benefits.\"",
      "She says she attempted changing servers and even switched to different cities within the U.S., but she still couldn\u2019t access the sites. Carol, that sounds like a serious issue. Understandably, you would want to use a VPN when visiting websites, and not being able to access them can be quite frustrating. This situation may even force you to disable your VPN, which could put you at risk. Below, I\u2019ll discuss why this happens and how you can work around the issue.",

      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A\u00a0virtual private network (VPN) is a secure connection method used to add privacy and security to private and public networks, like the internet and Wi-Fi hotspots. VPNs are often used to protect sensitive data and to ensure that online activities are safe from cyber threats. By encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online identity, a VPN provides anonymity and protects against hackers, snoopers and data breaches. It also allows you to access content that may be restricted based on your geographic location, making it a great tool for boosting your online privacy and freedom.\u00a0Here are 10 reasons you need a VPN at home.",
      "Why are you not able to access certain websites when using a VPN?",
      "Website owners can decide who gets to access their sites and who doesn\u2019t. Many sites block IPs from known VPNs or data centers, especially if their content is restricted to certain countries or regions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Big platforms like Netflix or banking sites often use VPN detection tools to prevent people from accessing their services anonymously. Government websites do this, too, mostly to prevent people from bypassing regional or national restrictions. For instance, in countries with strict content rules, blocking VPNs helps prevent people from accessing content the government doesn't want them to see.",
      "But even setting your VPN to a different location in the same country doesn\u2019t always work. Why? Because some sites are trying to keep cybercriminals out. VPNs can hide your identity and location, which is great for privacy but can also be misused for fraud. Government websites dealing with things like taxes, voting or benefits need to verify who you are and where you\u2019re logging in from to prevent misuse. Allowing VPNs could make it easier for fraudsters to slip through.",
      "Another reason for blocking VPNs is to keep bots at bay. Bots can use VPNs to scrape government websites or overload their systems. Blocking VPN traffic helps protect sensitive information and makes it easier to trace and authenticate real users.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO USE VPNS WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR BANKING APPS",
      "6 ways to bypass VPN blockers",
      "If you're having trouble accessing certain sites with your VPN on, try the steps below. Start from the first step and keep going until the issue is resolved.",
      "Using a reliable VPN service is one of the best ways to work around VPN blocks. Not all VPNs are created equal, and choosing a high-quality provider can make a significant difference. Look for a VPN that offers obfuscated or \"stealth\" servers, which disguise VPN traffic to appear as regular internet usage, making it harder for detection systems to block you.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A good VPN should also have a large server network with plenty of options across different locations so you can easily switch if one server is blocked. Some services even offer dedicated IP addresses, which are less likely to be flagged compared to shared ones.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOTSPOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH A VPN",
      "If one server isn\u2019t working, try connecting to another in the same country or region. VPN providers usually have multiple servers, and switching might help you bypass the block. If this doesn\u2019t work, use obfuscated servers. These servers are designed to hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN. They can bypass strict VPN detection systems, especially on government or streaming websites.",
      "To bypass VPN blocks, you can change the connection protocol your device uses. VPN protocols determine how devices link to servers, and some protocols are more adept at evading detection than others.",
      "If you're facing issues accessing specific websites, switching to a different protocol may help. For instance, some protocols offer a good balance of speed and security, while others prioritize faster performance or efficiency, potentially improving your ability to bypass restrictions.",
      "For more detailed information, it's important to research which protocols are best suited for specific use cases, as the effectiveness of different protocols can vary.",
      "WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?",
      "If you only need the VPN for certain apps or websites, enable split tunneling in your VPN settings. This lets you access blocked sites using your regular connection while keeping the VPN active for other purposes. For example, you can enable split tunneling to watch a movie on Netflix using your regular internet connection while keeping your banking app secure with the VPN.",
      "Not all VPNs are created equal. Some are better at bypassing blocks than others. If your current VPN isn\u2019t working, consider switching to one that specializes in evading detection.",
      "If all else fails, switch to a mobile data connection or a different network. Sometimes, the issue is with your current ISP (internet service provider) rather than the VPN.",
      "30% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEB. HERE\u2019S WHY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "VPNs are great for getting around restrictions, but some websites have blockers to stop VPN traffic. There are a few ways to get around these blockers, and sometimes, it's just as easy as switching servers. You\u2019ll have the best chance of getting your VPN unblocked if you're using a reliable service. They keep an eye on their servers to make sure everything\u2019s running smoothly and offer extra features like dedicated IP addresses.",

      "\"In many authoritarian states, Christianity is seen as a proxy for Western influence and values, which regimes often reject as imperialistic or destabilizing,\" King told Fox News Digital. \"Christianity and other faiths emphasize allegiance to a higher moral authority, which inherently challenges authoritarian regimes that demand complete loyalty to the state.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 06:00:46 -0500",
    "summary": "A third year of war in Ukraine drags on as the new year and the conflict&apos;s February anniversary approach. The war in 2024 saw major shifts on the battlefield and in Western politics.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram provides details on the White House response to Russia's Christmas Day attack and the incoming Trump administration's push for a rapid end to the war.",
      "As the third year of war in Ukraine nears a close as the new year approaches and ahead of the Feb. 24, 2025, anniversary date, new battle lines have once again been established after Russia made advances in the east and Kyiv opened a new battlefront, this time in Russia.",
      "The war that had already plagued Europe, the U.S. and, to an extent, the Middle East, costing a whopping $278 billion\u00a0in aid for Ukraine, including\u00a0nearly $87 billion\u00a0from Washington, expanded to Asia in 2024 as geopolitical rivalries in the Indo-Pacific began playing out through proxy in Ukraine.",
      "2024 began with a heated fight in Congress over whether the U.S. should supply more military aid to Ukraine, a fight that highlighted major divisions in the Republican Party and Kyiv's deep reliance on Washington's military support.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers are shown during a training exercise on Dec. 15, 2024. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The monthslong debate, which finally ended in April, had major implications for Ukraine when it came to its ability to defend against Moscow's missiles and its ability to counter Russian offenses. In 2023, Russia was unable to make any major advances despite the sheer number of men the Kremlin has long been able to throw into its war machine.",
      "But 2024 politics in the U.S. changed the reality of war for Ukraine.",
      "NATO LEADERS PREDICT ERA OF 2% DEFENSE SPENDING 'PROBABLY HISTORY' AS TRUMP REPORTEDLY FLOATS HIGHER TARGET",
      "The stalled supplies not only significantly increased Ukraine\u2019s vulnerabilities in the east, particularly in Donetsk, it enhanced frustration from Kyiv, NATO allies and those who argued that defending Ukraine is in the U.S.\u2019s security interest. It escalated attention around the Biden administration\u2019s strike bans on U.S.-supplied long-range missiles, which the president eventually lifted in November.",
      "As U.S. politics at home grew increasingly volatile ahead of the presidential election, uncertainty mounted over what another Trump White House could mean for Kyiv; a question that has already had other geopolitical consequences.",
      "In late April, the House passed a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine that pushed U.S. financial commitments to $183 billion since Russia first launched its invasion in 2022. The package was meant to prompt an immediate surge in the delivery of military equipment and supplies, which, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, had fallen to 10% of what it had been the year before.",
      "The European Union in June officially began membership talks with Ukraine after determining Kyiv had met the necessary requirements to join an economic and political partnership by countering corruption, reining in political lobbying, increasing transparency around officials\u2019 wealth and bolstering the rights of national minorities.",
      "By the July NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., some members began ramping up pressure on the Biden administration, along with other allies like the U.K. and Germany, to lift any and all strike restrictions enforced on Ukraine, which prevented Kyiv from hitting military targets and weapons depots deep inside Russia, a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly said was needed to better stop Russia\u2019s missile and drone attacks.",

      "Moscow in September looked to secure its defense budget for 2025, and the federal government submitted a plan to its State Duma that called for $183 billion to be allocated for national security and defense next year, which amounted to some 41% of its annual expenditures, according to the Institute for the Study of War.",
      "That figure appeared to have been whittled down by the time it reached Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s desk in early December as he signed off on a 13.5 trillion ruble plan ($124 million), and it accounts for 32.5% of Russia\u2019s 2025 budget, according to the Associated Press.",
      "In October, the G-7 finalized a $50 billion loan to Ukraine that would be paid using frozen Russian assets, and on Christmas Eve, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv had received its first $1 billion from the U.S.",

      "President Biden has vowed to fast-track as much military assistance to Ukraine as he can during the final days in office.",
      "Throughout the war, Russia has relied on a heavy missile and drone campaign to brutalize the entirety of Ukraine. But in 2024, Moscow escalated its aerial attacks targeting towns and cities, particularly in eastern Ukraine, ahead of its infantry advances, even if it meant the complete decimation of urban areas.",
      "The ruins of Toretsk, Ukraine, are shown on Dec. 19, 2024. (Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "2024 saw more battlefield movement than 2023, though according to data provided by the Institute for the Study of War, this was largely seen in the second half of the year, a price for which Russian paid heavily.",
      "November proved to be a particularly brutal month, with Russia seeing its highest battlefield losses ever with 45,720 casualties reported in November, which was up from nearly 42,000 in October, along with an estimated $3 billion worth of military equipment, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.",
      "Moscow also twice set the record for the greatest number of drone strikes it levied against Ukraine in a single campaign since the war began, first with 145 drones fired overnight on Nov. 9, followed by 188 strikes beginning the night of Nov. 25.",
      "After more than a year of a relatively stagnant front line, Russia in May launched a new front in Kharkiv, which Ukraine had liberated in 2022, though the Kremlin\u2019s renewed offensive largely failed.",

      "RUSSIAN PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS KILLED IN FRIENDLY FIRE ATTACK BY NORTH KOREANS AFTER ENLISTING DPRK HELP",
      "By early August, Ukraine made international headlines when it launched a surprise ground incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region. It was an apparent attempt to divert forces from eastern Ukraine to the Kremlin\u2019s home turf and give it a bargaining chip when the time comes for peace negotiations.",
      "The campaign was the largest attack on Russia since World War II, and by mid-October the Pentagon had confirmed that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia, with some 11,000 North Korean soldiers believed to be fighting Ukraine in Kursk, the first foreign nation to send in troops since the war began.",
      "Though North Korea is not the only nation to aid Russia in its invasion, Iran has for years been sending Shahed drones. In September, the U.S. accused Iran of supplying Russia with short-range ballistic missiles.",
      "Ukraine is estimated to have lost 40% of the land it initially seized in Russia, according to reports last month. But North Korea is also reported to have endured heavy losses, with Zelenskyy claiming this week that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed in the fighting while others face extreme logistical shortages, including access to clean water, the Associated Press reported.",

      "China has also been accused of aiding Russia by covertly sending it military support in the form of microelectronics and semiconductors, among other items.",
      "North Korea\u2019s direct involvement in Russia\u2019s war has further highlighted the divisions in the Indo-Pacific that have arisen in recent years, not only in the face of Chinese aggression, but Pyongyang\u2019s, which is a dynamic that has become caught up in the largest war Europe has seen since World War II as Japan and South Korea increasingly back Western allies and view the Russia-North Korea alliance as a threat.",
      "North Korea\u2019s deployment of troops to Russia reportedly prompted South Korea to consider escalating its non-lethal aid by mulling over a supply of missiles. Japan on Christmas Day sent Ukraine $3 billion in frozen Russian assets, adding to the $12 billion Tokyo has provided to Kyiv. In addition, Japan also pledged to support Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, which Russia routinely targets.",
      "Russia once again solidified its primary winter strategy by attacking Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure on Christmas Day by firing 184 drones and missiles across the country, according to Ukraine\u2019s air force. The attacks sparked mass blackouts amid freezing temperatures in multiple regions, including Kharkiv in the north, the central Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava areas, as well as Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine.",

      "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT. Syria's Bashar Assad has been accused of extreme torture and murder within his prison system. (Getty Images, Reuters, AP)",
      "In the shadow of Syria\u2019s brutal civil war, one institution stands as a chilling symbol of the regime\u2019s systemic violence: Sednaya prison. Referred to as the \"Death Factory\" or the \"Human Slaughterhouse,\" Sednaya became a site of unimaginable suffering.",
      "Around 100,000 individuals, according to reports, have disappeared into Assad'a prisons, where people, including thousands of women and children, were detained, tortured and killed.",
      "\"Rights groups have documented that at least 10% of those detained lost their lives in these prisons, though some reports suggest the figure could be as high as 20%,\" said Joseph Braude, founder of the Center for Peace Communications, an NGO dedicated to resolving identity-based conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, whose group gained rare access to Sednaya. \"The number continues to rise as families speak out about the whereabouts of their missing loved ones, many of whom remain unaccounted for.\"",

      "A bloodied noose at a recently liberated prison in Syria. (Reuters)",
      "Sednaya was not just a prison, it was a tool to crush any form of resistance or humanity. \"The prison was located on a hill outside Damascus,\" Ahed Al Hendi, a former political prisoner and Syrian affairs analyst, told Fox News Digital. \"We would see it while going to a nearby tourist area, but even if you were just driving by, you were afraid to talk about it. If you said, \u2018Sednaya,\u2019 you would end up there.\"",
      "Al Hendi continued: \"I\u2019ve heard from my friends describing the sights going into Sednaya this week. They found bags of bones, there was still fresh blood on the floor, the smell of death, and the torture machines, which were the most horrible things they\u2019ve seen. One friend told me he saw a mother hugging the torture machine, believing her son had died there. It was a tragic image, seeing her holding the machine that killed her son, thinking she could still smell him in the machine. The tools were unimaginable, like a massive metal press designed to liquefy bodies and make them unrecognizable.\"",
      "As Assad regime\u2019s atrocities at Sednaya become clearer, and after days of looking for survivors and realizing that some people may never be found, attention has shifted to mass graves. Braude\u2019s team on the ground in Syria is currently collecting evidence. \"We're documenting, we're interviewing people who are there, trying to use equipment to discover any possibility of secret underground prisons.\" He said the team had recently worked at a mass grave site \"where we estimate 100,000 people were buried.\"",
      "\"Some of the people in these mass graves came from Sednaya and died under torture,\" Al Hendi said. \"Many show gunshot wounds, and their bodies were moved to a large area where the regime placed old military equipment to create the illusion of a restricted military zone. Locals reported seeing refrigerated trucks entering the area with security forces blocking the roads. The trucks stayed for hours before leaving. People became accustomed to the smell of death.\"",

      "Sednaya prison became a symbol of the regime\u2019s relentless repression. \"It wasn\u2019t just political opponents,\" said Al Hendi,\u00a0who was arrested for establishing a secular anti-regime student organization. \"Children and women were also taken as hostages to pressure their fathers or husbands. We found children born there as a result of rape by prison guards. Entire families were destroyed by the regime.\"",
      "The conditions in Sednaya were inhumane. Prisoners were often starved, beaten and tortured with electricity. \"When they execute someone, they don\u2019t feed them for three days before the execution. The guards say, \u2018Why feed him? We will take the food for ourselves.\u2019 Imagine someone about to die, and they are starved first, denied even the dignity of a last meal,\" Al Hendi said.",

Outside, hundreds of families anxiously wait for news of their missing or disappeared loved ones, clinging to the hope of a reunion.

      "The atrocities committed at Sednaya were part of a broader campaign by the Assad regime to exterminate its opposition in the most horrific ways. Both Braude and Al Hendi emphasize the need for accountability. \"What we need now is truth and reconciliation,\" Braude says. \"Only by acknowledging the suffering and recognizing the full scope of the atrocities can Syria begin to heal. If we don\u2019t do that, we risk perpetuating cycles of vengeance.\"",
      "After the fall of the Assad regime earlier this month, Sednaya was liberated, and thousands of prisoners were freed. \"The prisoners who emerged from Sednaya were traumatized, many of them unable to even remember their own names,\" Al Hendi said. \"They had been detained for so long they didn\u2019t even know that Assad\u2019s father had died. They thought Assad was still in power.\"",

      "Robert Petit, the Head of the International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism for Syria (IIIM), visited Damascus and observed the extensive documentation of the regime\u2019s atrocities, noting in a press release the \"chilling efficiency\" with which these crimes had been systematized. He emphasized the urgent need to preserve this evidence, warning, \"Time is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold. Each day we fail to do so, we risk losing the chance for comprehensive accountability.\"",
      "The investigations into Sednaya and the mass graves have painted a horrific picture of the regime\u2019s violence, but they also serve as a call for justice, Braude said. \"The consequences of the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities are profound. The key question now is how the population can move forward and rebuild, rather than descending into further civil conflict. There is a fear of cycles of vengeance, but true reconciliation can only come through truth and acknowledgment.\"",
      "He said that \"99% of Syria\u2019s prison guards belong to the Alawi community.\" \"We\u2019re talking about half the young population of the Alawi sect, as most of them work in the army or secret police. The rebels have proposed a solution: Russia will surrender Assad and 100 top officials responsible for the atrocities. In return, rebels would offer amnesty to low-level perpetrators who were following orders. If Russia facilitates this, it could help prevent further violence and bring stability to Syria.\"",

      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",

Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida, told the AP.",

      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said. Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They told the AP there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",

    "story": [
      "New Orleans had access to effective anti-vehicle barriers ahead of the Bourbon Street attack on New Year\u2019s Eve revelers that killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more, but the city did not deploy those barriers until a day after the carnage unfolded, and the head of the local police department said she had been unaware of them.",
      "New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said Thursday while reopening Bourbon Street that the city had added more protections, including heavy trucks and Archer barriers \u201cthat would be preventive if someone had, or if this particular terrorist, went around up on the sidewalk.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what authorities say occurred just after 3 a.m. Wednesday, when a Texas man inspired by the Islamic State group drove a pickup truck onto a sidewalk filled with people on Bourbon Street, mowing down pedestrians before opening fire on police, wounding two officers and dying in the shootout.",
      "The L-shaped Archer barriers that were installed one day later are portable, reusable and designed to stop a car that is careening toward a pedestrian-only area. The 700-pound steel barriers, which are certified by the Department of Homeland Security, were credited with preventing casualties in a similar incident last year in California at the Rose Parade.",
      "When asked about where the Archer barriers came from, Kirkpatrick told reporters: \u201cActually, we have them. I didn\u2019t know about them, but we have them, and so we have been able now to put them out.\u201d",
      "New Orleans bought the Archer barriers in 2017 from Meridian Rapid Defense Group, which manufactures them, according to Peter Whitford, the company\u2019s CEO. He confirmed that the barriers that appeared on Bourbon Street on Thursday looked the same as the ones from eight years ago.",
      "\u201cThey bought them from us and I don\u2019t know where they were on that day \u2014 so I can\u2019t answer that question,\u201d he said of the New Year\u2019s Day attack.",
      "The barriers helped protect central New Orleans during the Mardi Gras parade in 2017, according to a news release Meridian put out that year. \u201cPainted a festive canary yellow, the barriers allowed free pedestrian flow and emergency vehicle access, through the streets while providing a solid perimeter to unwanted vehicles,\u201d the release said.",
      "The New Orleans mayor\u2019s office and police department did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon.",
      "Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s attack, the city had recently removed security barriers known as bollards from Bourbon Street because they were malfunctioning, and the city\u2019s Department of Public Works was in the process of installing new ones. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Bourbon Street was protected by patrol cars, other barriers and a large law-enforcement presence, but they weren\u2019t enough to stop the attacker, Kirkpatrick said at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe terrorist just went all the way around up onto the sidewalk,\u201d she said.",
      "When asked Thursday about whether she was upset she hadn\u2019t known about the Archer barriers, Kirkpatrick demurred.",
      "\u201cThis is not a matter of pointing blame anywhere \u2014\u00a0a terrorist is hell-bent on destruction. This man was going to do his best, and if it hadn\u2019t been on Bourbon, he was going to go somewhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have this. We\u2019re going to implement it. End of story.\u201d",
      "The Archer barriers played a key role in preventing a similar tragedy last year at the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, when a woman rammed into one of the barricades protecting the crowd at the packed New Year\u2019s event, according to Lisa Derderian, a Pasadena spokesperson.",
      "The city uses a \u201ctiered\u201d approach to keep people from driving into the parade route, including public works trucks filled with sand, bollards and the Archers. When the woman drove into one of the Archers, it stopped her, Derderian said.",
      "\u201cIf those barriers were not up \u2014 she could have more than likely killed people in her path,\u201d Derderian said.",
      "Pasadena has rented the barriers to protect the Rose Bowl parade for the last five years, costing the city $110,000 a year, according to Derderian."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean authorities tried and failed Friday to carry out an unprecedented arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to declare martial law in a dramatic standoff at the presidential residence where Yoon has been staying since he was impeached last month.",
      "Investigators and police officers began leaving Yoon\u2019s official residence in central Seoul around 1:30 p.m. local time (11:30 p.m. Thursday ET), more than five hours after they first passed through the steel gates.",
      "They said they had suspended the execution of the arrest warrant for the day \u201cbecause we have concluded that it is impossible to execute it today,\u201d citing safety concerns as they were blocked by Yoon\u2019s presidential security detail.",
      "\u201cIt is to our extreme regret that the suspect did not respond to the legal proceedings,\u201d a joint team of investigators said in a statement.",
      "The warrant, which Yoon\u2019s lawyers say is illegal, does not expire until Monday and officials could try to execute it again before then.",
      "They are seeking to detain Yoon for questioning on possible charges of insurrection, one of the few crimes for which South Korean presidents do not have immunity. Officials would then have to apply for a separate court warrant in order to formally indict and continue to hold him.",
      "Thousands of police officers arrived at the compound on Friday, a month to the day after Yoon\u2019s short-lived declaration of martial law.",
      "In addition to Yoon\u2019s security detail, they faced a growing crowd of Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters outside the residence who were trying to form a \u201chuman shield\u201d to protect him from arrest, some of whom waved American flags in a show of support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance.",
      "Officials said Yoon\u2019s arrest warrant had been served to the presidential security chief, Park Jong-joon, at 10:11 a.m. Friday.",
      "The Presidential Security Service, which has also blocked investigators from searching Yoon\u2019s office and residence in recent weeks, told NBC News that it was required by law to protect the president, including from anyone entering the premises to execute warrants.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Investigation Headquarters said Friday afternoon that Park had been summoned \u201cover obstruction of special official duties.\u201d",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party criticized the actions of the presidential security detail and said Choi Sang-mok, South Korea\u2019s second acting president since Yoon\u2019s impeachment on Dec. 14, should take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to ensure Yoon\u2019s arrest.",
      "Though Yoon, 64, is not the first South Korean president to be impeached, he would be the East Asian democracy\u2019s first sitting president to be arrested. He has been suspended from presidential duties since his impeachment pending a Constitutional Court trial to determine whether it should be upheld.",
      "The court, which held a second hearing Friday, said that oral arguments would begin Jan. 14. The court has 180 days to make a ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment, which if confirmed would trigger a presidential by-election within 60 days.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said Friday that he is \u201cready to abide by the law as long as it is the rightful due process of law.\u201d",
      "They have challenged the warrant issued Tuesday to arrest Yoon and search the presidential office and residence, saying the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading the joint investigation team, does not have comprehensive command authority over the police.",
      "\u201cLegal actions will be taken against any unlawful circumstances arising during the execution of this illegal warrant,\u201d one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, Yoon Kap-geun, said by text message Friday.",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament.",
      "In a surprise late-night address on Dec. 3, he accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist North Korea and declared emergency martial law, which included a ban on all political activity.",
      "He lifted the order about six hours later after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Though Yoon has apologized for the martial law declaration, he has repeatedly defied summonses to appear for questioning in the criminal investigation, saying it was within his power as president to issue the order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980.",
      "The episode has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a long history of military-authoritarian rule but has since transitioned into one of Asia\u2019s most vibrant democracies and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "A Gallup Korea poll released Dec. 13 found Yoon had an approval rating of 11%, down from 19% before the martial law declaration.",
      "Yoon still has some supporters, however, thousands of whom have gathered outside the presidential residence in recent days. Some waving American flags argued that Yoon and his conservative People Power Party are more supportive of the U.S. alliance than the liberal Democratic Party, which they accused of being friendlier toward China and North Korea.",
      "Others held signs adopting a slogan associated with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud in 2020, \u201cStop the Steal.\u201d",
      "Kang Minwoo, a 30-year-old office worker, said the suspension of the arrest warrant on Friday was a victory for Yoon supporters like him.",
      "\u201cWe need to continue to protect the president because it is not over yet,\u201d said Kang, whose voice was hoarse from shouting at the protest all night. \u201cI am planning to stay here over the weekend.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the protesters late Wednesday, Yoon said he had been watching their efforts via YouTube.",
      "\u201cThank you so much and I feel sad,\u201d he wrote, adding that he worried for their health in the bitterly cold weather.",
      "Yoon, who was once the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, said South Korea was in \u201cdanger\u201d because of efforts by \u201canti-state forces\u201d inside and outside the country \u201cto steal the sovereignty of this nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will fight until the end standing with you to protect our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country belongs to each and every person in South Korea and not a government or a party.\u201d",
      "The Democratic Party said Yoon\u2019s message to supporters was \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cdemonstrates that he remains trapped in his delusions.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost concerning is his incitement of extreme conflict and chaos among his supporters through this message,\u201d Cho Seung-rae, the party\u2019s chief spokesperson, said Thursday. \u201cAs if orchestrating a rebellion was not enough, he is now stirring his followers to provoke extreme clashes and disorder.\u201d",
      "State media in North Korea, which technically remains at war with the South, said Friday that the crisis in South Korea had resulted in \u201cparalysis of its state administration and spiraling socio-political confusion.\u201d",
      "While Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was initially acting president after Yoon\u2019s impeachment, he was in the job for less than two weeks before he was also impeached\u00a0on Dec. 27 after he refused to immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies on the Constitutional Court.",
      "Choi, the former deputy prime minister and minister of economy and finance, became the new acting president two days before a\u00a0Jeju Air plane crashed\u00a0in the southwest city of Muan, killing 179 of the 181 people on board in the world\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster of 2024.",

    "summary": "A new test can differentiate between various types of asthma via a nasal swab. Researchers hope it can eventually help match patients with better treatments.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "A new paper describes a test that can differentiate between different types of asthma via a nasal swab.Researchers hope the test can eventually be used to help match patients with better treatments.The research focused on Black and Puerto Rican children, who have higher rates of asthma and asthma-related deaths than white children.",
      "A new paper describes a test that can differentiate between different types of asthma via a nasal swab.",
      "Researchers hope the test can eventually be used to help match patients with better treatments.",
      "The research focused on Black and Puerto Rican children, who have higher rates of asthma and asthma-related deaths than white children.",
      "For many children diagnosed with asthma, pinpointing the particular nature of their case and finding appropriate treatment is far from simple.",
      "The lung disease, which affects more than 4.6 million children in the U.S., is often broken down into two categories. The first, known as \u201cT2-high\u201d asthma, is caused by inflammation from a particular type of immune system cell called T helper 2. Until recent years, it was assumed to be the most common form.",
      "The second category, \u201cT2-low\u201d asthma, is essentially a catchall for other forms. It encompasses two subtypes \u2014 one involving less inflammation, and another characterized by inflammation from a different kind of T cell.",
      "In some moderate or severe cases, figuring out which type of asthma a child has can help doctors match patients with proper treatment. But testing options have long been limited: Typically, doctors either draw blood to measure levels of immune cells or antibodies, or have children breathe into a mouthpiece to measure the nitric oxide in their breath.",
      "However, the tests aren\u2019t always accurate, and they only detect T2-high asthma, and thus can\u2019t differentiate between other subtypes.",
      "So researchers at the University of Pittsburgh developed a more precise way to diagnose different asthma subtypes: collecting nasal swabs, then sequencing the RNA they contain. In people with two of the asthma subtypes, certain genes associated with inflammation are more highly expressed, so the researchers looked for those hallmarks. The third subtype was identified through the absence of those genetic hallmarks.",
      "They describe the novel test in a paper published Thursday in the journal JAMA. The researchers used the test on more than 450 children and teens across three studies: one in Puerto Rico, one in Pittsburgh and one in both locations. The study participants were predominantly Puerto Rican or non-Hispanic Black.",
      "The analysis showed that the nasal swabs could accurately diagnose several asthma subtypes. It also found that \u201cT2-low\u201d asthma \u2014 which has been associated with air pollution \u2014 was most common among the participants.",
      "Black and Puerto Rican children have higher rates of asthma and asthma-related deaths than white children in the U.S. and are more likely to be exposed to asthma triggers like air pollution, dust or mold.",
      "The research builds on previous studies that have similarly detected asthma via nasal swabs.",
      "The researchers hope the test can improve the process of matching kids to appropriate asthma treatments, said Dr. Juan Celed\u00f3n, one of the paper\u2019s authors and chief of pulmonary medicine at UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh.",
      "\u201cTo me, this is a necessary first step for better personalized medicine,\u201d he said.",
      "The default treatment for any type of asthma is steroids, usually delivered through an inhaler. But in moderate or severe cases, that might not be enough. In the last decade, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several injectable or intravenous drugs for such patients. These counteract molecules that trigger inflammation in the airways, but they are largely geared toward T2-high asthma.",
      "Celed\u00f3n said the nasal swab test could help researchers identify people with T2-low asthma for the purpose of enrolling them in studies that test new treatments for that target.",
      "\u201cInstead of treating most people the same, in a few years, we can treat you better according to the type of asthma you have,\u201d he said.",
      "The new findings are also noteworthy because the research involved children of color, who are often underrepresented in asthma studies, said Dr. Gurjit Hershey, director of the asthma research division at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, who was not involved in the new paper.",
      "\u201cMany studies have been done traditionally in white, European populations. \u2026 To be able to have a study that really focuses on Puerto Rican and Black children is important,\u201d she said.",
      "However, the technology isn\u2019t ready to go mainstream. Celed\u00f3n said it would need FDA approval before doctors could use it.",
      "Plus, Hershey said, more research is needed to determine if a child\u2019s asthma type is consistent throughout their youth, or if it changes in response to environmental exposures such as pollution or allergens.",
      "\u201cThe place to be cautious is, does it make sense to treat based on this?\u201d she said, referring to the nasal swab test results. \u201cWe would have to do a study to figure that out.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jessica Hui, a pediatric allergist at National Jewish Health, a respiratory hospital in Denver, also cautioned that genetic sequencing is expensive, and the results would need to be analyzed by someone proficient in studying RNA.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very specialized type of analysis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is something we can implement immediately, but for sure it\u2019s an exciting direction.\u201d"

      "John Greer resigned from the sheriff\u2019s office in October 1980 amid an internal investigation that the release said may have been prompted by Greer's actions with another woman, who is not identified in the release. That woman's husband told the sheriff\u2019s office at the time that Greer had been following his wife and trying to have sex with her.",
      "The woman died on Sept. 29, 1980, in what the sheriff\u2019s office described as a possible suicide.",

      "\"Although investigators suspected something was not right about the incident, there was no evidence to prove the case was anything other than suicide,\" the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "Seventy-one days later, at 1:40 a.m., John Greer radioed dispatch and reported discovering Easterly's body at a farm store in the nearby city of Punta Gorda, according to the release. The medical examiner's office found Easterly had been shot twice with a 12-gauge shotgun \u2014 once in the head and once in the back, the sheriff's office said.",
      "A friend of Easterly's later told investigators that the clerk had dated a deputy she believed was Greer but had become fearful of him, according to the release. The friend recalled Easterly describing the deputy's account of his wife's death as an accidental shooting that occurred after an argument.",
      "Decades later, after the sheriff's cold case unit put out a release seeking information about Easterly's death, a woman who had been in a youth program at the sheriff's office told investigators that Greer repeatedly sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her, according to the release.",
      "During one assault after Easterly's death, the release says, the woman said Greer invoked the dead woman's name: \"Ask them dead b----es like Adele Easterly what happens when they say no to me.\u201d",
      "The release does not say whether investigators questioned Greer in 2023 about the woman\u2019s allegations, and a spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. The release says detectives interviewed several former employees in the sheriff's office and people associated with the youth program and obtained statements that supported some of the woman's account.",
      "After detectives developed probable cause for Greer's arrest, they found him in Tennessee and questioned him at the long-term care facility.",
      "At the time, the release says, he was bedridden and could not carry on long conversations, but he appeared to understand the questions and answered in the affirmative when he was asked directly whether he had shot his Easterly and his wife.",
      "The detectives were unable to determine whether Jackie Greer's shooting was intentional or an accident, according to the release.",
      "The sheriff's office said it will continue to investigate Greer, who worked for other law enforcement agencies after he left Charlotte County, to determine whether he is linked to other crimes."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to avoid the same fate that his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, experienced two years ago: an embarrassing, drawn-out floor fight for the speaker\u2019s gavel.",
      "A small band of right-wing rabble-rousers is threatening to derail Johnson\u2019s bid Friday to retain the speakership. It typically would be a difficult task to take on an incumbent speaker. But Republicans hold such a paper-thin majority in the new 119th Congress that just two GOP defectors could block Johnson from winning the top job for another two years.",
      "Three days ago, Johnson received a big boost when President-elect Donald Trump publicly gave the Louisiana Republican his \u201cComplete & Total Endorsement,\u201d arguing that Johnson's election would help the GOP-controlled Congress execute his 2025 agenda. The speaker said he spent New Year's Day with Trump at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, shortly after an explosion in a Cybertruck outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas.",
      "But Johnson has already lost one GOP vote; Rep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, is rallying colleagues on X against Johnson, whom he blames for striking deals on government spending, Ukraine aid and the renewal of a powerful surveillance program known as FISA Section 702.",
      "Lawmakers said the unpredictable Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., is also someone to watch; she has not committed to backing the speaker and is seeking some assurances.",
      "\u201cI respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan,\u201d Massie wrote on X before the new year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.\u201d",
      "On Thursday afternoon, Johnson hosted a handful of detractors in his office to hear their demands. Spartz was there, along with several members of the House Freedom Caucus: Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md.; past chairmen Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Scott Perry, R-Pa.; and Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C.",
      "Norman described it as a good discussion that focused on things like spending cuts but said he remained undecided and wouldn't announce his decision about Johnson until Friday's floor vote, leaving the chamber in suspense.",
      "Trump's endorsement \"matters a whole lot,\" Norman said, adding that \"people trust Mike Johnson.\"",
      "For his part, Johnson is expressing confidence that he\u2019ll retain the gavel in the public roll call set for noon Friday \u2014 the first vote of the new Congress when each House member present must verbally cast their vote for speaker.",
      "Democrats are expected to vote for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. And nearly all Republicans are expected to cast their vote for Johnson, who won his party\u2019s nomination for speaker shortly after the Nov. 5 election.",
      "After his meetings Thursday, Johnson emerged from his office and said he was hopeful he would win the election on the first ballot. \"I hope so. That's the plan,\" he told reporters.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News earlier in the day, Johnson touted Trump\u2019s endorsement and warned that any political games with the speakership could delay Congress\u2019 certification of Trump\u2019s election victory on Monday, Jan. 6. The Louisianan also suggested that the House could not afford to delay organizing itself in the new Congress due to national security threats like the deadly New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "No other business can get done until the House chooses its leader. That means House committees can't be organized, bills can't be introduced, and other votes can't happen.",
      "\u201cWe will get this done. Look, the things that we\u2019re talking about this morning are an illustration that we live in very serious times. We cannot afford any palace drama here. We have got to get the Congress started, which begins tomorrow, and we have to get immediately to work,\u201d Johnson said on Fox News.",
      "\u201cWe have to certify the election of President Donald J Trump on Jan. 6, on Monday. And we have many important things pressing on us right now, so there\u2019s no time to waste. We have to stay unified.\u201d",
      "Johnson is facing a similar math problem that McCarthy faced just two years ago when a small bloc of conservative rebels \u2014 led by then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. \u2014 teamed with Democrats to prevent McCarthy from winning the gavel. It took 15 rounds of voting over multiple days, and personal phone calls from Trump, to convince the Gaetz group to stand down.",
      "Because of his own small majority, McCarthy would only narrowly win the speakership. But just 269 days later, Gaetz worked with Democrats again to topple McCarthy, sparking a no-holds-barred battle to succeed him which drew all House business to a standstill for three weeks.",
      "In the end, Johnson, then the congenial No. 7 GOP leader in the House with no known enemies, was unanimously elected speaker after more senior-ranking leaders tried and failed.",
      "On Fox, Johnson acknowledged that he's dealing with a challenging \"numbers game.\" Republicans won a 220-215 majority in November. But Gaetz resigned from office after the election and said he would not be sworn in for the new 119th Congress on Friday, cutting the GOP advantage to 219-215.",
      "Johnson would need at least 218 votes \u2014 a simple majority \u2014 to win the gavel if all House members are present on Friday.",
      "He said he spent the holidays reaching out to \u201cevery single one\u201d of his GOP critics. And, he told Fox, he's making the case that he\u2019s the best person for the job and that Republicans \u2014 who starting later this month will control all the levers of power in Washington \u2014 cannot afford to delay enacting Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, which includes renewing tax cuts and strengthening border security.",
      "He recently told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity he had a 45-minute phone call with one of his loudest critics, Spartz.",
      "\u201cWe have unified government that begins tomorrow. We have the White House, the Senate and the House \u2014 a totally different situation than we dealt with over the last 14 months since I\u2019ve been speaker,\u201d Johnson said on Fox. \u201cSo we\u2019re excited to deliver on the America First agenda.\u201d",
      "If Johnson manages to secure the gavel, House Republicans are set to quickly vote on a rules change that would make it harder to oust him from the speaker's office midway through his two-year term.",
      "Under the current rules, any House member can force a vote to expel the speaker by filing a resolution known as a \"motion to vacate.\" It's how McCarthy was removed from power.",
      "But the proposed GOP rules package for the new Congress states that no less than nine lawmakers are needed to trigger a floor vote to oust the speaker and the nine must be members of the majority party \u2014 in this case, Republicans.",
      "The rules change was part of a deal negotiated between the leaders of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and the leadership-friendly Main Street Caucus shortly after the November election."

      "In an appearance on Fox News, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Thursday also sought to portray the attack as a border security failure, said that congressional Republicans had been \"ringing the alarms\" about \"the idea that dangerous people were coming here in droves and setting up potentially terrorist cells around the country.\"",
      "Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., wrote in response to images of the dead suspect on X Wednesday that the \"open border,\" the nation's immigration system and Congress' inaction on the issue \"have created the perfect storm to endanger Americans.\"",
      "Similarly, Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., shared on X a video of an interview he did Wednesday about the terror attack and wrote, \"We must secure the border & guarantee our local enforcement is empowered to enforce the law and protect the American people from these cowards!\"",
      "NBC News reported earlier this year that about 0.014% of migrants who had tried to cross the border in fiscal year 2024, or fewer than 2 out of every 10,000, were on the terrorist watchlist. The total number who have tried to cross during the Biden administration is just over 1,700. During the Trump presidency, it was 1,400.",
      "A Trump spokesperson on Thursday defended the president-elect's remarks surrounding the New Orleans attack.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump rightfully highlighted that criminals crossing the border have committed some of the most heinous crimes this country has witnessed in its history,\" Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said in a statement. \"It is also true that radical Islamic terrorism and its warped ideology have crossed into our country and infected those looking to spread hate and violence.\u201d",
      "The offices of Greene, Johnson, Gimenez and Crane did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fox News also did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Once he reached Bourbon Street, he planted two improvised explosive devices and then got back into his truck and plowed into revelers, killing 14 before police shot and killed him in a gunbattle.",

We\u2019re digging through more of the social media, more interviews, working with some of our other partners to ascertain a little bit more about that connection.\u201d",
      "\u2018Time is of the essence\u2019",
      "Jabbar grew up in Beaumont, a city in eastern Texas near the Louisiana border. He attended Central High School, where he was known for his polite, easygoing way and polished appearance. He tended to wear button-up shirts and polos, former classmates said.",
      "\u201cHe was very grounded, reserved, quiet,\u201d said Chris Pousson, who attended middle school and high school with Jabbar.",
      "After he graduated in 2001, Jabbar sought to serve his country. He initially tried to enlist in the Navy in 2004, according to three U.S. defense officials, but he left after only a month. He then joined the Army, working as a human resource specialist and information technology specialist from 2007 to 2015.",
      "His unit deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010.",
      "Groen, Jabbar\u2019s commander, wrote on social media that he worked \u201cquietly and professionally\u201d as a human resources officer and mail clerk in Afghanistan, \u201censuring the little things that kept us all connected to home were done with care and precision.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo think that the same individual who once embodied quiet professionalism could harbor so much hate, leading to such unspeakable atrocities, is incomprehensible and heartbreaking,\u201d added Groen, who declined an interview request.",
      "After his time in the military, Jabbar attended Georgia State University and majored in computer information systems, a university spokesperson said.",
      "He was quoted in an article for the student newspaper in 2015 about the challenges military veterans face navigating college life.",
      "\u201cThe culture isn\u2019t too much different but once you get out of the military there\u2019s so many different acronyms you\u2019ve learned,\u201d Jabbar said. \u201cAnd as you transition out ... you don\u2019t know how to speak without using these terms and you\u2019re not sure what terms are used outside the military.\u201d",
      "He also said veterans have to be extremely diligent to ensure they receive payments through the GI Bill.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a large agency,\u201d he said, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs. \u201cYou have to do your due diligence, make sure you have your paperwork together.\u201d",
      "Jabbar looked back fondly on his time in the service and encouraged his half-brother to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cIt set him straight,\u201d Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said, referring to a period after high school when Jabbar was partying and had some minor run-ins with the law. \u201cIt gave him some discipline and grounded him.\u201d",
      "After he graduated in 2017, Jabbar tried his hand in real estate. In a promotional video posted to YouTube in 2020, he said his time in the military helped him learn \u201cthe meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive.\u201d",
      "But his real estate career was short-lived. He began working for the Deloitte consulting firm in 2021, a company spokesperson said.",
      "By then, his life was already beginning to fray. He was in divorce proceedings with his third wife \u2014 his first marriage ended around 2012 and his second in 2016 \u2014 and in deep financial trouble, according to court records.",
      "The company he formed, Blue Meadow Properties, lost $28,000 in 2021 and he had $16,000 in credit card debt, he wrote in an email to his then-wife\u2019s attorney.",
      "\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Jabbar wrote. \u201cI cannot afford the house payment. It is past due in excess of $27,000 and in danger of foreclosure if we delay settling the divorce.\u201d",
      "Jabbar made about $58 an hour at Deloitte and worked 40 hours a week, taking home a net income of $7,876.70 a month, according to documents he filed with the court.",
      "But his monthly expenses totaled around $9,000. In August 2022, he had only $2,012 in his bank accounts, according to the filings.",
      "Despite his financial troubles, Jabbar still showed up for his family. His half-brother said that their father had a stroke in 2023 and that Jabbar frequently came by to help take care of him.",
      "\u201cHe helped me bathe him, change him, feed him,\u201d Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said.",
      "\u2018Prays at home\u2019",
      "It remains unclear when Jabbar first became attracted to ISIS. His half-brother said that their father was Muslim and that Jabbar\u2019s mother was Christian but converted when they married.",
      "Jabbar was open about his Muslim faith. He made it clear that he wasn\u2019t into drinking or partying, but he didn\u2019t talk about it in a strident way, his half-brother said.",
      "They rarely discussed religion, but the war in Gaza did come up in a conversation last year.",
      "\u201cHe was upset about what\u2019s happening in Palestine,\u201d Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said. He remembered his brother saying \u201cit was genocide on both sides.\u201d",
      "Jabbar seemed to become more devout after his most recent divorce, Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said, but he never discussed ISIS or any radical ideologies.",
      "\u201cHe was trying to find himself,\u201d he said.",
      "Jabbar posted audio messages about Islam to a SoundCloud account in early 2024. In one titled \u201cSatan\u2019s Voice,\u201d he describes music as the \u201cvoice of Satan.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is a gentle, gradual luring into the things that God has made forbidden to us \u2014 the intoxicants like marijuana, alcohol, sedatives, opioids, stimulants and others,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there is the way that music entices us to elicit sex, vulgarity, violence, betrayal, arrogance, burglary, cheating.\u201d",
      "Pousson, his high school friend, said Jabbar frequently posted about his Islamic faith on Facebook but gave no hint of radicalization.",
      "\u201cIt was always positive \u2014 peace be with you, uplifting type of stuff,\u201d Pousson said. \u201cNothing that he posted online that I saw was negative.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see this coming from a mile away,\u201d he added.",
      "One of Jabbar\u2019s neighbors in Texas said he never saw him at the local mosque. \u201cHe says he prays at home,\u201d said the neighbor, who asked to remain anonymous.",
      "The neighbor said Jabbar was \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cquiet\u201d and largely kept to himself.",
      "On the morning of New Year\u2019s Eve, the neighbor said, he saw Jabbar loading a white truck outside his home. The neighbor went over to see whether he needed a hand, and Jabbar said he was moving to Louisiana.",
      "\u201cHe said he got a job over there,\u201d the neighbor recalled.",
      "It was sometime on New Year\u2019s Day that the neighbor learned Jabbar had traveled to New Orleans for a very different reason."

      "The court, which held a second hearing Friday, said that oral arguments would begin Jan. 14. The court has 180 days to make a ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment, which if confirmed would trigger a presidential by-election within 60 days.",

      "\u201cLegal actions will be taken against any unlawful circumstances arising during the execution of this illegal warrant,\u201d one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, Yoon Kap-geun, said by text message Friday.",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament.",
      "In a surprise late-night address on Dec. 3, he accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist North Korea and declared emergency martial law, which included a ban on all political activity.",
      "He lifted the order about six hours later after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Though Yoon has apologized for the martial law declaration, he has repeatedly defied summonses to appear for questioning in the criminal investigation, saying it was within his power as president to issue the order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980.",
      "The episode has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a long history of military-authoritarian rule but has since transitioned into one of Asia\u2019s most vibrant democracies and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "A Gallup Korea poll released Dec. 13 found Yoon had an approval rating of 11%, down from 19% before the martial law declaration.",
      "Yoon still has some supporters, however, thousands of whom have gathered outside the presidential residence in recent days. Some waving American flags argued that Yoon and his conservative People Power Party are more supportive of the U.S. alliance than the liberal Democratic Party, which they accused of being friendlier toward China and North Korea.",

      "In a letter to the protesters late Wednesday, Yoon said he had been watching their efforts via YouTube.",
      "\u201cThank you so much and I feel sad,\u201d he wrote, adding that he worried for their health in the bitterly cold weather.",
      "Yoon, who was once the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, said South Korea was in \u201cdanger\u201d because of efforts by \u201canti-state forces\u201d inside and outside the country \u201cto steal the sovereignty of this nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will fight until the end standing with you to protect our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country belongs to each and every person in South Korea and not a government or a party.\u201d",
      "The Democratic Party said Yoon\u2019s message to supporters was \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cdemonstrates that he remains trapped in his delusions.\u201d",

      "John Greer made the admission to investigators in April 2023 while he was living at an extended care facility in Tennessee, the sheriff\u2019s office said. He died March 2, 2024, at age 77, according to the release.",

      "John Greer resigned from the sheriff\u2019s office in October 1980 amid an internal investigation that the release said may have been prompted by Greer's actions with another woman, who is not identified in the release. That woman's husband told the sheriff\u2019s office at the time that Greer had been following his wife and trying to have sex with her.",

      "\"Although investigators suspected something was not right about the incident, there was no evidence to prove the case was anything other than suicide,\" the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "Seventy-one days later, at 1:40 a.m., John Greer radioed dispatch and reported discovering Easterly's body at a farm store in the nearby city of Punta Gorda, according to the release. The medical examiner's office found Easterly had been shot twice with a 12-gauge shotgun \u2014 once in the head and once in the back, the sheriff's office said.",
      "A friend of Easterly's later told investigators that the clerk had dated a deputy she believed was Greer but had become fearful of him, according to the release. The friend recalled Easterly describing the deputy's account of his wife's death as an accidental shooting that occurred after an argument.",
      "Decades later, after the sheriff's cold case unit put out a release seeking information about Easterly's death, a woman who had been in a youth program at the sheriff's office told investigators that Greer repeatedly sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her, according to the release.",
      "During one assault after Easterly's death, the release says, the woman said Greer invoked the dead woman's name: \"Ask them dead b----es like Adele Easterly what happens when they say no to me.\u201d",
      "The release does not say whether investigators questioned Greer in 2023 about the woman\u2019s allegations, and a spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. The release says detectives interviewed several former employees in the sheriff's office and people associated with the youth program and obtained statements that supported some of the woman's account.",
      "After detectives developed probable cause for Greer's arrest, they found him in Tennessee and questioned him at the long-term care facility.",
      "At the time, the release says, he was bedridden and could not carry on long conversations, but he appeared to understand the questions and answered in the affirmative when he was asked directly whether he had shot his Easterly and his wife.",
      "The detectives were unable to determine whether Jackie Greer's shooting was intentional or an accident, according to the release.",
      "The sheriff's office said it will continue to investigate Greer, who worked for other law enforcement agencies after he left Charlotte County, to determine whether he is linked to other crimes."

Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",
      "Lively said in a statement, \u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d",
      "Dec. 21, 2024: Baldoni reportedly dropped by talent agency",

      "Hoover responded to the complaint on her Instagram story on Dec. 21, posting a photo of her and Lively in an embrace with a link to the Times article.",
      "\u201c@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient since the day we met,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.\u201d",

      "Slate, who portrays the sister of Baldoni\u2019s character in the movie and the sister-in-law of Lively\u2019s, shared an exclusive statement Dec. 23 with TODAY.com in support of Lively.",
      "\u201cAs Blake Lively\u2019s castmate and friend, I voice my support as she takes action against those reported to have planned and carried out an attack on her reputation,\u201d Slate said. \u201cBlake is a leader, loyal friend and a trusted source of emotional support for me and so many who know and love her. What has been revealed about the attack on Blake is terribly dark, disturbing, and wholly threatening. I commend my friend, I admire her bravery, and I stand by her side.\u201d",

      "Baldoni and his publicists filed a lawsuit against The New York Times on Dec. 31, the Times reported the next day.",
      "The lawsuit seeks $250 million in damages and accuses the news organization of defaming Baldoni and his publicists in the Dec. 20 article that detailed Lively's allegations of being retaliated against after speaking up about sexual harassment on set, according to the Times.",
      "Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, provided the following statement to TODAY.com about the lawsuit against the Times.",
      "\"In this vicious smear campaign fully orchestrated by Blake Lively and her team, the New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites, disregarding journalistic practices and ethics once befitting of the revered publication by using doctored and manipulated texts and intentionally omitting texts which dispute their chosen PR narrative.",
      "\"In doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public. The irony is rich.",
      "\"Make no mistake however, as we all unite to take down The NY Times by no longer allowing them to deceive the public, we will continue this campaign of authenticity by also suing those individuals who have abused their power to try and destroy the lives of my clients. While their side embraces partial truths, we embrace the full truth \u2014 and have all of the communications to back it. The public will decide for themselves as they did when this first began.\"",
      "The New York Times shared a statement in response to Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit, stating, \u201cWe plan to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe role of an independent news organization is to follow the facts where they lead,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cOur story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article.\u201d",
      "Dec. 31, 2024: Lively files lawsuit against Baldoni",
      "The same day that Baldoni sued The New York Times, Lively initiated litigation against Baldoni in federal court in New York.",
      "The lawsuit, obtained by NBC News on Dec. 31, names Baldoni as well as Wayfarer Studios, Heath, Nathan and Abel.",
      "\"Earlier today, Ms. Lively filed a federal complaint against Wayfarer Studios and others in the Southern District of New York,\" attorneys for Lively said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"Ms. Lively previously sent her California Civil Rights Department Complaint in response to the retaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns. Unfortunately, Ms. Lively\u2019s decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks. As alleged in Ms. Lively\u2019s federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.",
      "\"Now, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court. Ms. Lively has brought this litigation in New York, where much of the relevant activities described in the Complaint took place, but we reserve the right to pursue further action in other venues and jurisdictions as appropriate under the law.\"",
      "Lively\u2019s attorneys also sent the following comment to NBC News in response to Baldoni's lawsuit against The New York Times.",
      "\u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis lawsuit is based on the obviously false premise that Ms. Lively\u2019s administrative complaint against Wayfarer and others was a ruse based on a choice \u2018not to file a lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer,\u2019 and that \u2018litigation was never her ultimate goal.\u2019\u00a0As demonstrated by the federal complaint filed by Ms. Lively earlier today, that frame of reference for the Wayfarer lawsuit is false.\u00a0While we will not litigate this matter in the press, we do encourage people to read Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint in its entirety. We look forward to addressing each and every one of Wayfarer\u2019s allegations in court.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION:\u00a0(Jan. 2, 2024, 3:12 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated when The New York Times published an article about Blake Lively's claims. It was on Dec. 21, not Dec. 20."

      "Not only has the actor called LA his home for more than two decades, but it\u2019s also provided plenty of fodder for his latest role as JD Campbell in the new Netflix series \u201cNo Good Deed.\u201d Campbell is a washed-up soap star, or, as Wilson puts it, \u201ca not-very-smart guy.\u201d",
      "\"For me, it was funny to play an empty-headed soap opera actor. I heard the description of the character, and it just started making me laugh just thinking of the ideas you could bring to it,\" Wilson tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "\"I mean, just living in LA, you come across successful actors and people that want to be successful actors, and there's all kinds of material for it,\" he explains.",
      "Wilson is no stranger to the Hollywood-style hijinx that play out in \"No Good Deed,\" a dark comedy that revolves around a group of scheming LA house hunters hoping to score a home being sold by Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano), a grieving couple with some surprising secrets of their own.",

      "What happened to Charmaine in Season 6 of \u2018Virgin River\u2019?",
      "After giving birth to her twin boys in Season 5, Charmaine adjusted to life as a new mom in Season 6. She wanted to shield her sons from their father Calvin (David Cubitt), a known criminal, but he insisted on being involved in their lives.",
      "In an effort to discourage Calvin and keep her family safe, Charmaine started the process of taking out a restraining order against her children's father.",
      "The hairstylist was supposed to help Mel and her bridal party get ready for her wedding to Jack (Martin Henderson), but was a no-show on the big day. The next morning, Mel was concerned that Charmaine wasn't answering her phone. Jack volunteered to stop by Charmaine's house to check in on her.",
      "When he arrived, Jack noticed that the door was ajar. Worried that someone had broken in, he entered the house and looked around. Jack then entered the nursery and seemed terrified as he looked around the room.",
      "The season ends before viewers can see what shocked Jack. Enter: Fan theories.",
      "\u2018Virgin River\u2019 fans have a theory about Charmaine\u2019s baby and Mel and Jack\u2019s adoption plans",
      "Throughout \u201cVirgin River,\u201d Mel has expressed her desire to become a mother, but it\u2019s been a heartbreaking road filled with several miscarriages.",
      "Now that Mel and Jack have opened up their hearts to adoption, some viewers are wondering if the show\u2019s writers will continue the parenthood arc by killing off Charmaine and leaving the couple to adopt her twin sons.",
      "One Reddit user made the following prediction, writing, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll go first.... Charmaine \u2014 is dead. The babies (sic) father killed her. The father goes to prison and Mel and Jack raise the twins.\u201d",
      "In the same thread, another Reddit user another theory riffing on the same idea: \u201cCharmaine has been kidnapped but the babies were left behind. Mel and Jack take the babies until Charmaine is found. While Charmaine is gone (this could be 5 years we know how they like to do her) they adopt the baby that\u2019s up for adoption.\u201d",
      "Over on X, viewers were equally intrigued, with one user penning the following reaction to the Season 6 finale: \u201cSo is Charmaine dead, Calvin dead! Will Jack and Mel end up adopting the other baby!\u201d",
      "Another X user agrees with the adoption theory \u2014 but has mixed feelings over what it means for Charmaine: \"I don\u2019t even want to think this but did Jack see Charmaine hurt or worse and him and Mel will get the twins?\"",
      "The cliffhanger also revived questions of Charmaine's twins' parentage. She told Jack that he was the father when she was first pregnant, then revealed Calvin was.",
      "\"When are we going to find out that Charmaine\u2019s twins are definitely Jack\u2019s?\" the X user wrote.",
      "One other fan thought Jack\u2019s frightened expression was less about Charmaine's fate and more about the state of her house.",
      "\u201cI really think the plot with Charmaine will not be as exciting or shocking as people want it to be. I don\u2019t think anything happened to her or the babies. The house was probably a mess because Charmaine was overwhelmed taking care of them,\u201d they wrote.",
      "What does Alexandra Breckenridge, who plays Mel, think happened to Charmaine?",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Breckenridge said she\u2019s just as unaware of Charmaine\u2019s fate as viewers, but is optimistic.",
      "\u201cHopefully Charmaine\u2019s OK. I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s OK somewhere. I\u2019m hoping,\u201d Breckenridge said.",
      "The actor is confident that her own character will end up becoming a mother sooner rather than later.",
      "\u201cMel and Jack are definitely going to end up having a child at some point. We don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be. They\u2019re moving towards that direction. It might be a bumpy road,\u201d she said.",
      "In the Season 6 finale, Mel gets a opportunity at motherhood when one of her clients at the birthing center calls and says the couple who was supposed to adopt her unborn child might be backing out. She then says she wants Mel and Jack to have her child.",
      "What happened to Charmaine in the \u2018Virgin River\u2019 books?",
      "Since \"Virgin River\" is based off a book series, some fans are turning to the books for clues about Charmaine's fate. Since Charmaine doesn't die in the books, killing her off on the show would be a bold move, but not beyond this dramatic show.",

    "summary": "Where is Matthew Miller, the subject of 'American Nightmare' who kidnappd Denise Huskins, now? What he had to say about his crime and the latest charges he is facing.",
    "story": [
      "The Netflix docuseries \"American Nightmare\" focused on the harrowing kidnapping of Denise Huskins, during which she was abducted from her California residence in front of her boyfriend Aaron Quinn in 2015 and held for two days before she was released.",
      "Authorities later arrested Matthew Muller on robbery and assault charges in 2015, suspecting him to be behind the abduction plot. Muller, a 2006 graduate of Harvard University and a U.S. Marine from 1995 to 1999, was once a practicing immigration attorney in San Francisco, according to an FBI arrest warrant obtained by NBC Bay Area. Muller, 47, has since been disbarred, according to the California State Bar.",
      "On Monday, Dec. 30, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office announced in a news release that Muller has been charged in two 2009 home invasion sexual assault cases that occurred in Mountain View and Palo Alto, California. The district attorney's office said in a statement that \"advances in forensic DNA testing\" helped the attorney's office connect Muller to the crimes. Muller, who is currently in prison, is now being charged with two felony counts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Muller\u2018s crimes and where he is serving his 40-year prison sentence for kidnapping Huskins.",
      "How did Matthew Muller kidnap Denise Huskins?",
      "Muller broke into Huskins and Quinn\u2019s home on Mare Island in Vallejo, California, between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 23, 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California.",
      "He used a stun gun and a simulated gun with a laser attached to order the victims to the ground, where he bound and blindfolded them with blackened swim goggles, before forcing them to drink sedative, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Muller also played a prerecorded message indicating that not following the commands would lead to physical punishment or electric shock.",
      "He then put Huskins into the trunk of his vehicle, which he drove to his residence in South Lake Tahoe, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Huskins said Muller forced her to have sex with him twice, which he videotaped, while she was held in captivity at the cabin.",
      "During this time, he also sent two emails to Quinn, demanding a ransom of $17,000. Muller released Huskins in Huntington Beach on March 25, 2015, with no ransom ever being paid, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "While Huskins was missing, a Vallejo Police Department detective questioned Quinn for hours, at times suggesting Quinn was involved with Huskins\u2019 disappearance, according to video footage of the interrogation aired in \u201cAmerican Nightmare.\u201d",
      "The day Huskins was released, the department said in a statement investigators had found no evidence of a kidnapping and accused Huskins and Quinn of faking the abduction.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all,\u201d Vallejo police said in the statement. \u201cGiven the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping.\u201d",
      "The Vallejo Police Department did not respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com.",
      "When was Matthew Muller arrested?",
      "Quinn and Huskins\u2019 case remained unsolved until the Dublin Police Services of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Department arrested Muller on charges from a separate home invasion case on June 8, 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "In the Dublin home invasion, a couple had been tied up while Muller attempted to abduct their daughter. Investigators found a cellphone they later traced to Muller, according to authorities.",
      "Dublin police searched Muller\u2018s South Lake Tahoe cabin and located evidence related to Huskins\u2019 abduction, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The FBI then searched the cabin, two other residences, a vehicle and a storage locker.",
      "FBI analysis of Muller\u2018s computers found a \u201csound recording consistent with the instructions given to Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins,\u201d as well as video recordings of Muller sexually assaulting Huskins, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Muller pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping in September 2015 in Huskins and Quinn\u2019s case, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Muller in 2022 pleaded no contest to two counts of forcible rape in California in Huskins\u2019 case, according to the District Attorney\u2019s office. He also pleaded guilty to state charges of robbery of an inhabited dwelling, residential burglary and false imprisonment.\u2013",
      "When was Matthew Muller sentenced?",
      "U.S. District Judge Troy L. Nunley sentenced Muller to 40 years in prison for Huskins\u2019 kidnapping in 2017.",
      "\u201cThe sentence imposed today reflects the egregiousness of Muller\u2019s conduct in this case. Muller had advantages in life that most people only dream of, yet he used his considerable intelligence to plan and execute the physical assault and psychological torture of two innocent strangers,\u201d Nunley said during the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to imagine the level of suffering that Muller inflicted on his victims,\u201d Nunley continued. \u201cThe sentence handed down today takes into account that suffering and strives to ensure that Muller will never again commit such crimes.\u201d",
      "Muller\u2018s defense attorney Thomas Johnson declined to comment to the Associated Press after the sentencing hearing, where he argued for a 30-year sentence, as his client had been diagnosed as manic and depressive and could be rehabilitated with proper treatment. (The 2015 FBI arrest affidavit stated Muller told authorities that he suffered from \u201cGulf War Illness\u201d and was bipolar.)",
      "In 2022, Muller was sentenced to 31 years in prison after he pleaded no contest to two counts of forcible rape and guilty to three other charges in Solano County Superior Court. His state sentence will be served concurrently with the federal sentence.",
      "Where is Matthew Muller now?",
      "Muller is serving his prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson, Arizona, according to the Bureau of Prisons. His release date is scheduled for July 8, 2049, per the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "He gave a jailhouse interview to NBC Bay Area in 2018. Muller said he was married and also said he was not guilty. He said he pleaded guilty to the federal kidnapping charge in 2015 because he felt sorry for the couple.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuse for the way the Vallejo Police Department handled it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I thought it was worth it to take a dive and made sure they achieved justice for that wrongful accusation.\u201d",
      "He also said his guilty plea had to do with a \"severe depression\" he fell into while in the Sacramento jail. \"I didn\u2019t care what happened to me,\u201d he said.",
      "Now, Muller is also facing two felony counts for sexual assaults during two home invasions in 2009. He was arraigned on Monday, Dec. 30 and faces life in prison if convicted, the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed in a statement.",
      "\"The details of this person\u2019s violent crime spree seem scripted for Hollywood, but they are tragically real,\" \u00a0District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a news release about Muller's latest charges. \"Our goal is to make sure this defendant is held accountable and will never hurt or terrorize anyone ever again. Our hope is that this nightmare is over.\"",
      "According to the district attorney's office, Muller allegedly broke into a woman's home in Mountain View, California, in the early hours of the morning of Sept. 29, 2009. He allegedly attacked her, bound her and forced her to drink a mixture of medications. He also threatened to rape her.",
      "\"After the victim, in her 30\u2019s, persuaded him against it, he suggested the victim get a dog, then fled,\" the district attorney's office said.",
      "A few weeks later, on Oct. 18, 2009, Muller then allegedly broke into another home in Palo Alto, California. There, he tied and gagged a woman also in her 30's and forced her to drink Nyquil. He then allegedly started assaulting her before the victim persuaded him to stop. He gave her crime prevention advice and left.",
      "The district attorney's office said both cases were investigated at the time but not solved."

      "The actor learned he had cancer after undergoing a colonoscopy and is receiving treatment, though he didn\u2019t specify the type. Colorectal cancer can be treated with medication, surgery and chemotherapy, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "Like many people, Van Der Beek thought colon cancer was an older person's disease, but it's now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50, the American Cancer Society notes. This may be due to factors such as eating more processed foods, higher rates of alcohol consumption, obesity and more sedentary lifestyles.",

      "The diagnosis came after a routine mammogram showed \u201csomething in my left breast,\u201d she added. Since Fischer has dense breasts, which can make cancer harder to spot, doctors recommended a follow-up breast ultrasound, she told TODAY.",
      "The tumor was so small it couldn\u2019t be felt on a physical exam, so Fischer urged women to get their annual screening.",
      "\u201cIf I had waited six more months, it could have been much worse. It could have spread. It was a very aggressive form of cancer,\u201d Fischer said.",
      "She underwent a lumpectomy to remove the tumor in January and received 12 rounds of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiation. She continues to receive medication infusions.",
      "Jamie Foxx",

      "\u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else,\u201d Coulier, 65, told TODAY.",
      "He started chemotherapy and expects a \u201ctotal remission\u201d when he finishes treatment by February 2025.",
      "Coulier shared an emotional moment with TODAY\u2019s Al Roker, a prostate cancer survivor, when the two men hugged in Studio 1A.",
      "Christie Brinkley",
      "The model, who recently posed for Sports Illustrated at age 70, announced in March that she was diagnosed with skin cancer.",
      "The basal cell carcinoma on her temple was caught early and removed, she wrote on Instagram.",

    "summary": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have reached a divorce settlement eight years after their split in 2016, her lawyer confirmed with NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have reached a divorce settlement after eight years of contentious back and forth in the public eye, a lawyer for Jolie confirmed to NBC News on Monday night.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family,\" Jolie's attorney, James Simon of Hersh Mannis, said in a statement. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "The settlement was signed and filed on Dec. 30, Jolie's team confirmed with NBC News. Pitt's team declined to comment.",
      "Once Hollywood's most famous couple, Pitt, 61, and Jolie, 49, met on the set of the 2005 movie \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" and got married in 2014. They share six children.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, citing irreconcilable differences. They were officially declared single in 2019 after being granted a bifurcated judgment, which meant they were technically still married but legally separated.",
      "The acrimony since their split has included Pitt filing a lawsuit in 2022 accusing Jolie of intentionally harming him and the French winery business they once shared. The former couple purchased shares in the 148-acre French vineyard Chateau Miraval together in 2008.",
      "The divorce agreement does not affect the legal dispute over the winery, which is ongoing.",
      "Following Pitt's lawsuit about the winery, Jolie filed a cross-complaint in which she alleged Pitt subjected their family to verbal and physical abuse. The \"Maria\" star alleged that Pitt choked one of their children and struck another in the face during a 2016 trans-Atlantic flight.",
      "No criminal charges were ever filed against Pitt. The FBI and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services closed an investigation into allegations of abuse on board the flight in 2016.",
      "\"Brad has owned everything he\u2019s responsible for from day one ... but he\u2019s not going to own anything he didn\u2019t do,\" Anne Kiley, an attorney for Pitt, told NBC News in part in 2022 following Jolie's cross-complaint.",
      "Earlier this year, the couple's daughter Shiloh, 18, was granted a request by a judge to drop \"Pitt\" from her last name.",
      "Another one of their daughters, Zahara, 19, also publicly excluded \u201cPitt\u201d from her name in 2023 when she\u00a0formally joined her sorority at Spelman College,\u00a0as seen in a video shared by Essence."

    "story": [
      "Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet is earning raves for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in \"A Complete Unknown.\"",
      "The 29-year-old actor practically channels the music legend as a burgeoning star in the early 1960s, transforming his shaggy locks to resemble Dylan's hairstyle and adopting Dylan's signature nasally speaking and singing style.",
      "Chalamet ultimately sang and performed over 40 songs for the movie.",
      "\u201cIt was important for me to sing and play live. Because if I can actually do it, why should there be an element of artifice here? And I\u2019m proud that we took that leap,\u201d Chalamet said in a featurette released ahead of the premiere.",
      "Here's what to know about how Chalamet became Dylan.",
      "Is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing in 'A Complete Unknown'?",
      "Chalamet not only sang all of Dylan's song for the film \u2014 he actually performed the songs live on camera, giving James Mangold, the movie's director, and others on the set \"chills,\" Mangold told an audience at the WGA during a post-screening in Beverly Hills this month, according to\u00a0Variety.",
      "Chalamet did originally pre-record Dylan's vocals, revealed Mangold, but the actor wanted to take a stab as performing live in character during an early scene depicting Dylan and Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy).",
      "\u201cWe shot that in the first five or six days,\u201d Mangold recalled. \u201cAnd there was a whole backstage thing with Timmy saying, \u2018I want to try it live.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mangold said his suggestion was met with some skepticism. \u201cSome of the sound and music direction people were like, \u2018It\u2019s not a good idea,'\" Mangold said.",
      "But he opted to allow Chalamet to give it a shot. \u201cAnd he was phenomenal. Not only that, he proved the brilliance of the method,\u201d said the director.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this moment where he finishes that song and he holds a note and just keeps hitting the low string on the guitar over and over again, and he\u2019s just his eyes are kind of boring into Woody, and he\u2019s just holding this note, and it gave him chills,\" Mangold recalled.",
      "\u201cI remember sitting there eight feet from him as he did it, and I remember thinking, \u2018Holy s---.\u2019 That could not have happened if there was an earwig in his ear,\" he added.",
      "Tod Maitland, the movie's sound mixer, told Variety that the biggest musical challenge for Chalamet was varying his vocal stylings to match Dylan's during specific performances.",
      "\"Bob\u2019s a mutterer, and Timmy gave his best mutter, so it was pulling that out. He would go from there to that twangy, tough voice that could shrill your eardrums,\" Maitland said. \"But there were, like four different voices inside of Timmy capturing all those and giving them all character was a whole other dimension.\u201d",
      "Though \"A Complete Unknown\" doesn't show Chalamet singing entire songs, each song was filmed \u201cfrom top to tail,\u201d Ted Caplan, the movie's supervising music editor, said.",
      "Chalamet even performed the entire set of Dylan's landmark 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance, which saw him swap his acoustic guitar for an electric one, much to folk music fans' disapproval.",
      "\u201cThat was recorded as a full concert; from the Hammer song to \u2018Baby Blue,\u2019 it was one run,\u201d Caplan said, adding, \u201cI think it gave it a special live real magic.",
      "\"You can see Timmy is so into it and in the mindset of it,\" Caplan added.",
      "Is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet playing the guitar in \u2018A Complete Unknown\u2019?",
      "In addition to singing, Chalamet played accompanying instruments.",
      "Guitar coach Larry Saltzman told the New York Post he began working with Chalamet in 2019, and said the actor \"took to\" playing the guitar \"immediately.\"",
      "\u201cHe never got hung up on something. He just rose to the occasion every time. I think it\u2019s a combination of hard work and just a gift,\u201d he said.",
      "Executive music producer Nick Baxter explained, speaking to the Gibson Gazette, a publication put out by the guitar manufacturer Gibson, how he worked with Chalamet to learn Dylan\u2019s guitar style. They went through the script and emphasized the \u201crawness,\u201d Baxter said.",
      "\u201cDylan\u2019s guitar playing is so unique; it\u2019s sort of messy and violent but also incredibly technically advanced, too. He\u2019s a great player. When you hear some of these early recordings, you can tell he\u2019d been playing guitar all the time, for many years. The technique is there, the playing is there, but there\u2019s a rawness to it. If you don\u2019t capture that, it sounds wrong immediately,\u201d he said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean authorities tried and failed Friday to carry out an unprecedented arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to declare martial law in a dramatic standoff at the presidential residence where Yoon has been staying since he was impeached last month.",
      "Investigators and police officers began leaving Yoon\u2019s official residence in central Seoul around 1:30 p.m. local time (11:30 p.m. Thursday ET), more than five hours after they first passed through the steel gates.",
      "They said they had suspended the execution of the arrest warrant for the day \u201cbecause we have concluded that it is impossible to execute it today,\u201d citing safety concerns as they were blocked by Yoon\u2019s presidential security detail.",
      "\u201cIt is to our extreme regret that the suspect did not respond to the legal proceedings,\u201d a joint team of investigators said in a statement.",
      "The warrant, which Yoon\u2019s lawyers say is illegal, does not expire until Monday and officials could try to execute it again before then.",
      "They are seeking to detain Yoon for questioning on possible charges of insurrection, one of the few crimes for which South Korean presidents do not have immunity. Officials would then have to apply for a separate court warrant in order to formally indict and continue to hold him.",
      "Thousands of police officers arrived at the compound on Friday, a month to the day after Yoon\u2019s short-lived declaration of martial law.",
      "In addition to Yoon\u2019s security detail, they faced a growing crowd of Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters outside the residence who were trying to form a \u201chuman shield\u201d to protect him from arrest, some of whom waved American flags in a show of support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance.",
      "Officials said Yoon\u2019s arrest warrant had been served to the presidential security chief, Park Jong-joon, at 10:11 a.m. Friday.",
      "The Presidential Security Service, which has also blocked investigators from searching Yoon\u2019s office and residence in recent weeks, told NBC News that it was required by law to protect the president, including from anyone entering the premises to execute warrants.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Investigation Headquarters said Friday afternoon that Park had been summoned \u201cover obstruction of special official duties.\u201d",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party criticized the actions of the presidential security detail and said Choi Sang-mok, South Korea\u2019s second acting president since Yoon\u2019s impeachment on Dec. 14, should take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to ensure Yoon\u2019s arrest.",
      "Though Yoon, 64, is not the first South Korean president to be impeached, he would be the East Asian democracy\u2019s first sitting president to be arrested. He has been suspended from presidential duties since his impeachment pending a Constitutional Court trial to determine whether it should be upheld.",
      "The court, which held a second hearing Friday, said that oral arguments would begin Jan. 14. The court has 180 days to make a ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment, which if confirmed would trigger a presidential by-election within 60 days.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said Friday that he is \u201cready to abide by the law as long as it is the rightful due process of law.\u201d",
      "They have challenged the warrant issued Tuesday to arrest Yoon and search the presidential office and residence, saying the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading the joint investigation team, does not have comprehensive command authority over the police.",
      "\u201cLegal actions will be taken against any unlawful circumstances arising during the execution of this illegal warrant,\u201d one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, Yoon Kap-geun, said by text message Friday.",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament.",
      "In a surprise late-night address on Dec. 3, he accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist North Korea and declared emergency martial law, which included a ban on all political activity.",
      "He lifted the order about six hours later after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Though Yoon has apologized for the martial law declaration, he has repeatedly defied summonses to appear for questioning in the criminal investigation, saying it was within his power as president to issue the order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980.",
      "The episode has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a long history of military-authoritarian rule but has since transitioned into one of Asia\u2019s most vibrant democracies and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "A Gallup Korea poll released Dec. 13 found Yoon had an approval rating of 11%, down from 19% before the martial law declaration.",
      "Yoon still has some supporters, however, thousands of whom have gathered outside the presidential residence in recent days. Some waving American flags argued that Yoon and his conservative People Power Party are more supportive of the U.S. alliance than the liberal Democratic Party, which they accused of being friendlier toward China and North Korea.",
      "Others held signs adopting a slogan associated with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud in 2020, \u201cStop the Steal.\u201d",
      "Kang Minwoo, a 30-year-old office worker, said the suspension of the arrest warrant on Friday was a victory for Yoon supporters like him.",
      "\u201cWe need to continue to protect the president because it is not over yet,\u201d said Kang, whose voice was hoarse from shouting at the protest all night. \u201cI am planning to stay here over the weekend.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the protesters late Wednesday, Yoon said he had been watching their efforts via YouTube.",
      "\u201cThank you so much and I feel sad,\u201d he wrote, adding that he worried for their health in the bitterly cold weather.",
      "Yoon, who was once the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, said South Korea was in \u201cdanger\u201d because of efforts by \u201canti-state forces\u201d inside and outside the country \u201cto steal the sovereignty of this nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will fight until the end standing with you to protect our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country belongs to each and every person in South Korea and not a government or a party.\u201d",
      "The Democratic Party said Yoon\u2019s message to supporters was \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cdemonstrates that he remains trapped in his delusions.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost concerning is his incitement of extreme conflict and chaos among his supporters through this message,\u201d Cho Seung-rae, the party\u2019s chief spokesperson, said Thursday. \u201cAs if orchestrating a rebellion was not enough, he is now stirring his followers to provoke extreme clashes and disorder.\u201d",

      "The IDF alleged that Kamal Adwan had been used as a \"Hamas command center.\" More than 240 people were detained over the weekend, all of them \u201cterrorists,\u201d it added in a statement.",
      "Sharing a photo of Abu Safiya, over the weekend, the international human rights group Amnesty International said it was \"extremely concerned over the fate & wellbeing\" of the medical director.",

      "The IDF said it has been \u201cwell documented that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers\u201d for its operations and pointed to weapons and tunnel systems found at and around hospitals. It also pointed to the alleged confession of former Kamal Adwan Hospital Director Ahmad Kahalot, whom the IDF detained last year and said had confessed to being a senior Hamas member.",
      "Local health officials vehemently dispute claims that medical centers are used by Hamas or other militants. NBC News was not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s claims.",
      "Israeli forces' repeated attacks on hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza have left the enclave's health care system decimated amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis, with most facilities damaged or destroyed in Israel's more than a yearlong military offensive.",
      "\"If a hospital has been reduced to a bombed-out shell, it would cease to be protected, but otherwise a hospital, whether immediately used or not, is presumptively protected as an important civilian institution,\" Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, previously told NBC News. \"It can be attacked only if actively used for military purposes, and even then, only if the civilian harm is not disproportionate.\"",
      "The Illinois-based nonprofit organization MedGlobal was also among those to condemn the IDF's attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital, calling it a \"brutal violation of a protected medical space\" as it echoed calls for Abu Safiya's release.",
      "\"Dr. Abu Safiya and his team constitute the lifeline of healthcare provision in northern Gaza,\" Rajaa Musleh, MedGlobal\u2019s Gaza country director, said in a statement.",
      "More than 45,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israeli forces launched their offensive in the enclave after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict."

      "2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Ukraine.",
      "After a year of significant gains for Russia, looming large is the presidency of Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war in \u201ca single day\u201d \u2014 even if he has indicated that he is in part sympathetic to Moscow\u2019s arguments and has remained skeptical of promising open-ended military aid to Kyiv.",
      "Some experts believe that, for this reason, it\u2019s likely that Ukraine, and Europe, will need to prepare for a prolonged war.",
      "\u201cTrump, with his unpredictable policy on military support for Kyiv and on how to end the war, will be the biggest challenge,\u201d Justyna Gotkowska, the deputy director of the Center for Eastern Studies, a think tank based in Warsaw, said in an op-ed last week.",
      "After more than 1,000 days of war, Ukraine is running short on manpower while the Kremlin has stepped up bombings of cities and infrastructure, launching missiles, drones and artillery rounds at civilian targets.",
      "Nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by the Russian forces, though Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive efforts have driven the fight onto Russian land, where large swathes of territory in the Kursk border region have been seized.",
      "And while the country has successfully fended off a number of air attacks in recent months, the Ukrainian military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, conceded on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops have advanced significantly in the eastern Donetsk region in the past few months. The area of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian defense linchpin, could especially pave the way for Moscow to seize swathes of more territory.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now walks a diplomatic tightrope.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy\u2019s greater challenge right now is to ensure continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine,\u201d said Ann Dailey, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank.",
      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cWe are not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukrainian membership in NATO for 20 years, as well as to introduce a peacekeeping contingent of British and European forces into Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov told state-owned TASS news agency.",
      "\u201cSince NATO\u2019s long-standing expansion was one of the main causes of the Ukrainian crisis, ensuring Ukraine\u2019s nonaligned status remains among the goals of the special military operation that must be achieved,\u201d the foreign minister said.",
      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",
      "Dailey said it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to think that \u201cyou could enter negotiations with Russia and believe you would get any concessions that you did not force them to concede at the tip of a spear.\u201d",
      "Put simply, Russia currently sees itself as having the advantage both militarily and politically.",
      "\u201cUnder these conditions, I do not anticipate Russia would concede much of anything,\u201d she added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s unease is underscored by the seemingly cordial terms between the American and Russian leaders.",
      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

      "The move was no surprise; Ukraine repeatedly said it would not renew the deal, which Zelenskyy said last month gave Russia \u201cthe opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood.\u201d",
      "But it will not be painless, with Ukraine losing up to $1 billion a year in transit fees it charged Russia to use its pipeline, Reuters reported. That\u2019s less than the $5 billion Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant, is set to lose annually, according to the news agency.",
      "Gazprom confirmed in a statement Wednesday that the pipeline agreement had lapsed following \"repeated and explicit refusal to extend these agreements\" by Ukraine.",
      "Most European countries no longer depend on Russian gas, having diversified their supplies \u2014 to the United States, Qatar and others \u2014 after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Nevertheless, halting the pipeline sent European Union natural gas prices rising to 50 euros ($52), their highest since the 330-euro spike in 2022 after the invasion.",
      "Turning off the taps may also affect Austria, Slovakia and particularly Moldova \u2014 which is not part of the E.U. \u2014\u00a0all of whom rely on Russian gas more than most in Europe. Already in the Moldovan breakaway region of Transdniestria, home to 450,00 people and 1,500 Russian troops, the local energy company cut off domestic hot water and heating supplies Wednesday, Reuters said.",
      "Not only is Russia's Ukrainian natural gas artery down, but the Nord Stream gas pipelines also remain damaged by as-yet unexplained explosions in September 2022. That leaves only the TurkStream pipeline linking Russia with Turkey, Hungary and Serbia.",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 2, 2025, 7 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the pipeline deal gave Russia \u201cthe opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood.\u201d It was last month, not earlier this month."

      "Whereas 3.5 million cases of the painful parasitic infection were recorded in 1986, preliminary data indicates there were just 11 this year.",
      "Carter died Sunday at age 100.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter hoped to outlive the Guinea worm \u2014 and he came achingly close to achieving that goal.",
      "Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, and his nonprofit, the Carter Center, led a decades-long campaign against the disease, marshalling funding, tracking cases, helping to quell outbreaks and organizing support among world leaders and health agencies.",
      "Guinea worm infections are caused by a parasitic worm whose larvae can contaminate water. When people consume the tainted water, the larvae mature inside the body, growing to about 3 feet long. The worms then burrow out of people\u2019s bodies, blistering the skin as they exit in an agonizingly painful process that can take weeks.",
      "In 1986, five years after Carter\u2019s presidency ended, 3.5 million cases of the disease were recorded globally. As of early December, preliminary data indicates that just 11 cases have been recorded this year, and in just two countries \u2014 Chad and South Sudan, according to Adam Weiss, the director of the Carter Center\u2019s Guinea Worm Eradication Program.",
      "\u201cWe continue to see a tightening of how widely distributed the disease is from more than 20 countries in the 1980s to just a few so far this year,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cA lot of good progress is being shown.\u201d",
      "In 1986, the World Health Assembly called for eradication of Guinea worm disease. The Carter Center, a nonprofit created by the former president, stepped in to lead the effort, partnering with health departments in partner countries, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carter visited a village in Ghana in 1988 that was suffering from Guinea worm infections, and he often spoke about an image that haunted him from that visit \u2014 of a Guinea worm emerging from a woman\u2019s swollen breast.",
      "\u201cIt left such a deep imprint on him, not because he saw despair. He felt the despair, but what he saw was there\u2019s an opportunity,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt was something he couldn\u2019t turn his back on.\u201d",
      "Carter remained focused on the project until his death, telling reporters in 2015 that he wanted \u201cthe last Guinea worm to die before I do,\u201d according to The Associated Press. He received updates on Guinea worm even after he entered hospice care, the AP reported.",
      "Only one human disease \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated by human efforts. Guinea worm disease could become the second, though it may take years and new methods to push the effort across the finish line.",
      "The disease, which is most often reported in rural, impoverished areas without clean drinking water, remains endemic in several African countries. People can be infected by multiple worms at a time \u2014\u00a0one man in Nigeria suffered as health workers removed more than 80 worms from his body in 1999.",
      "Unlike smallpox, there is no vaccine or treatment to stop Guinea worm disease. So the Carter Center has worked with African and Asian health agencies to change how rural villagers live daily life by offering education about how the disease spreads and how to prevent it, providing water filters to those in need and using larvicides to control outbreaks.",
      "By 2000, the disease had been eliminated from Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cYou need a champion like President Carter to say, \u2018This is the flagship program of the Carter Center in health. We want this done,\u201d said Dr. Jordan Tappero, the deputy director of neglected tropical diseases for the Gates Foundation, which has given funding to the Carter Center\u2019s work.",
      "The World Health Organization\u2019s goal is to eradicate Guinea worm disease by 2030. For that to happen, global cases have to remain at zero for three consecutive years.",
      "This year\u2019s preliminary case total of 11 represents a record low, but Tappero said more work lies ahead and new methods are likely required to achieve eradication.",
      "Complicating the efforts are cases of Guinea worm disease detected in domestic animals. Guinea worm disease was first detected in dogs in 2012, forcing a shift in strategy.",
      "\u201cInfection in dogs and cats in these last countries makes it harder to get there by 2030,\u201d Tappero said. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach a dog to say this pond is safe to drink from, and that one\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "Tappero said researchers are developing tools to immediately detect signs of the disease in water samples, working on diagnostic tests that could identify cases months before the parasite emerges and pursuing trials of a drug called Flubendazole for use in infected dogs.",
      "In 2022, the Carter Center held a summit for some of the last countries fighting the disease. Angola, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mali, South Sudan and Sudan all agreed to accelerate their efforts to eradicate Guinea worm.",
      "\u201cThat kind of political will is so important \u2014 having that kind of high-level commitment coupled with at the village level. People just want to get this done,\u201d Weiss said. The path Carter paved, he added, makes it \u201cpretty straightforward now.\u201d",

By law, a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament\u2019s operations even under martial law.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party \u2014 which he has called \u201ca monster\u201d and \u201canti-state forces\u201d \u2014 that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government\u2019s budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants.",
      "Yoon Kap-keun, a lawyer for the president, called the detainment warrant \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cillegal,\u201d saying the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. The presidential security service said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on when it would proceed with the warrants.",
      "\u201cUnless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\u201d said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \u201cShould investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\u201d",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon\u2019s residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",
      "Park Sung-min, president of Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant is likely an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with investigations.",
      "Former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 following an impeachment over a corruption scandal, also refused to meet with prosecutors while in office. She underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Despite Yoon\u2019s deployment of troops and police, enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law enactment.",
      "Yoon has claimed he wasn\u2019t trying to stop the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. But comments by now-arrested commanders of military units sent to the assembly have contradicted this claim.",
      "Kwak Jong-keun, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, testified at the National Assembly that Yoon called on troops to \u201cquickly knock down the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\u201d Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "The country\u2019s political crisis deepened last Friday, when the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo as well over wrangling over his refusal to fill in three justice seats at the nine-member Constitutional Court. Observers say adding more justices could increase prospects for the court\u2019s endorsement of Yoon\u2019s impeachment as that requires support from at least six justices.",
      "The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, has become South Korea\u2019s new interim leader. On Tuesday, Choi appointed two new justices, saying he feels the urgency to resolve political uncertainty and national divide."

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:01:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Sanctions introduced after Vladimir Putin launched his war in Ukraine are affecting the price of Russia's traditional new year dish, the Olivier Salad.",
    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 It\u2019s akin to Turkey at Thanksgiving: On New Year\u2019s in Russia, revelers traditionally consume lashings of Olivier salad.",
      "It was introduced to the then-Russian Empire in 1860 by French chef Lucien Olivier, but these days everyone has a slightly different recipe. It\u2019s so popular that the cost of its staple ingredients \u2014 which usually include sausage, potatoes and dollops of mayonnaise \u2014 have their own price index that\u2019s tracked by the media.",
      "With soaring inflation and the ruble dropping to one of its lowest levels against the dollar since President Vladimir Putin launched his war in Ukraine, this year Russians will have to pay more for the dish, which is traditionally served alongside caviar and tangerines, before the New Year is toasted in.",
      "Along with rising food prices, a weaker ruble following the latest round of American sanctions in November has fueled inflation and driven up the cost of imports into Russia. A huge increase in military spending has also led to labor, supply and production shortages. And while workers from every industry have volunteered or been called up to serve in Ukraine, farming has been among the worst affected.",
      "The so-called Olivier Index, which monitors how much it costs to make one of the salads for four people, is up 16% year over year, to 414 rubles from 348, according to Rosstat, Russia\u2019s federal statistics agency. (That\u2019s equivalent to a jump to $3.94 from $3.31.)",
      "And prices have shot up for other groceries such as eggs (up 45% since January) and butter (up almost 40%), according to data released this month by Rosstat. Potatoes, meanwhile, cost almost twice as much as they did a year ago. Between November and December alone, they rose 10% from 99.99 rubles to 109.99, according to an NBC News analysis. While not a staple food, caviar has shot up to almost 9,000 rubles per kilo from 6,000 in December 2023, Rosstat found.",
      "So ordinary people, for whom the average salary is around $830 a month, are feeling the pinch.",
      "\u201cEverything\u2019s getting more expensive \u2014 bread, meat, vegetables, fruit,\u201d Svetlana Govorukhina told NBC News in a telephone interview earlier this month.",
      "\u201cI can see everything is getting more expensive but as I can still afford all I need,\u201d added Govorukhina, a 69-year-old music teacher from Kaluga, a city around 125 miles south of Moscow.",
      "\u201cI can support myself even in the current situation. But as long as I cannot do anything about the economic situation, I prefer not to waste my emotions on it,\u201d she added.",
      "But that puts her in the minority, as rising prices become the most pressing concern for Russians in most regions, according to a study published Dec. 27 by CROS, a Moscow-based marketing and communications agency. Prices replaced the war in Ukraine as the main concern for the first time since February 2022, when Putin ordered the invasion of his neighbor, according to the findings, which are based on analysis of social media trends and reports in traditional news media.",
      "\u201cThe rise in prices is particularly painful for the poorest, but the middle class \u2014 accustomed to higher levels of consumption and frequently purchasing imported goods \u2014 may feel the impact more acutely,\u201d Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin based nongovernmental organization, said earlier this month.",
      "And that was certainly the case for Moscow-based university worker Anna, 37, who said the cost of \u201cbaby foods, diapers and so on grew colossally,\u201d as sanctions started to bite shortly after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine and her son turned 1.",
      "Prices \u201cbounced back a bit later, but since then everything has rather been getting more and more expensive,\u201d she said.",
      "Anna did not want her last name or the name of her husband to be published out of fear of retribution against her family. Putin\u2019s war next door has brought a far-reaching crackdown on dissent at home, and anything that can be perceived as an anti-war stance could result in arrest or even jail time.",
      "She added that meat and fruit prices had also risen, but she was still prepared to splurge.",
      "\u201cWhen I see the final sum at the checkout, I start worrying as it used to be significantly smaller for the same list,\u201d Anna said. \u201cBut I still buy the same, I am not cutting back on anything.\u201d",
      "She added that she was going to make Olivier salad for New Year's but would use potatoes grown by her mother-in-law, who like many Russians is mindful of previous economic hardship and keeps her own vegetable garden.",
      "\u201cAs for the sparkling wine, we will go with Italian. We are ready to pay more for it,\u201d Anna said.",
      "Her husband\u2019s \u201cmajor complaint is that there is no good beer anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just does not like Russian beer brands.\u201d",
      "An overheating economy?",
      "Addressing the economy at his annual end-of-year news conference earlier this month, Putin said that inflation was a problem and that  the country\u2019s economy was \u201coverheating.\u201d In part, he blamed international sanctions for price rises, \u201cbecause they make logistics more expensive,\u201d but he also appeared to criticize Russia\u2019s central bank for failing to tame inflation.",
      "In an apparent response, the bank did not raise its interest rate to 23% the following day, a move that had been widely expected.",
      "While the social and financial difficulties have yet to translate into significant political dissent \u201ceven with substantial repression,\u201d avoiding large-scale anger over economic issues \u201cmatters to the authorities and it appears to matter to Putin,\u201d Alex Brideau, of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy, said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "He added that Putin had \u201cbeen able to shift the blame for high prices away from himself and onto the government or businesses in the past and will probably do that again.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said, the rising prices would \u201cput a lot of pressure on the government to show that it is handling the situation with minimal disruption to the public\u2019s holiday festivities.",
      "Back in Russia, music teacher Govorukhina was determined to make the best of the New Year celebrations.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t eat a lot when we were younger, and now as we have gotten older we need even less. I can afford caviar, but not crab meat, though it is now hard to find a good one,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI have friends who complain, but I am not like that. Your lifestyle is more important than money. I love music and going to concerts, I love my job \u2014 this helps to somewhat cushion these blows. We have never had a rich life.\u201d",
      "Lena Medvedeva reported from Moscow. Karen Glichrist and Henry Austin from London."

    "summary": "A woman will lead the Central Bank of Syria for the first time in the institution's 70-year history after the country\u2019s new leadership appointed Maysaa Sabrine.",
    "story": [
      "A woman will lead the Central Bank of Syria for the first time in the institution's 70-year history after the country\u2019s new leadership appointed Maysaa Sabrine, a former deputy governor of the bank, to helm it.",
      "In leading the institution that manages the country's currency and sets its monetary policy, she will be in a prime position to help heal an economy shattered by 13 years of war and stringent international sanctions. Today, about 70% of Syria's population lives in poverty, and another 30% in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "Sabrine, whose appointment was reported by Reuters, is expected to replace Mohammed Issam Hazime, who had been named governor in 2021 by since-ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad.",
      "She now faces the task of leading the bank through a dire financial landscape, with Syria\u2019s economy having deteriorated significantly in the years since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011.",
      "Her rise to the top role comes as Syria's new de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and his Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham\u00a0group, which led rebel forces in the Assad regime's ouster, seek to project a more moderate image, promising an inclusive society in which the country's myriad religious and ethnic groups, as well as women, will be represented.",
      "In a recent interview with the BBC, Sharaa sought to contrast his vision for a future Syria against the leadership of the Taliban in Afghanistan, where women have faced extreme restrictions that bar them from public spaces, as well as from seeking higher education.",
      "Pointing to HTS' record in Idlib in Syria's northwest, where the rebel group has governed for years, he noted that he believed in educational access for women.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had universities in Idlib for more than eight years,\u201d Sharaa said, adding: \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sabrine had already held a number of prominent roles within Syria's central bank, including first deputy governor and supervising director, according to the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya.",
      "In addition, Sabrine, who holds a master\u2019s degree in accounting, has also served as a member of the Damascus Securities Exchange Board of Directors since 2018, representing the Central Bank, according to the broadcaster.",
      "In the days since Assad's ouster, the Central Bank has sought to liberalize Syria's economy, which was previously heavily controlled by his regime.",
      "Sharaa has called on Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to lift the crippling sanctions that targeted the Assad regime.",
      "The U.S. earlier this month removed a $10 million bounty that was placed on Sharaa himself after meetings between U.S. diplomats and the HTS leadership. But HTS itself remains on Washington's terrorist list.",
      "While the weeks since Assad's ouster Dec. 8 have remained relatively stable in Syria, Sharaa said over the weekend in an interview with Al Arabiya that it could take up to four years for new elections to be held.",
      "And fears have grown that the delicate and relative peace that has washed over Syria in the days since Assad's overthrow could be easily disrupted. Protests by members of the Alawite community, the minority sect the Assad family belongs to, erupted last week in Homs after video showing an Alawite shrine in Aleppo being vandalized circulated online.",
      "The demonstrations prompted the country's revamped security forces to institute new security measures in Homs, the country's third-largest city, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters also took to the streets in Christian neighborhoods of Damascus last week after a Christmas tree burning deepened fears that new leadership would still oversee a crackdown on religious minorities in the country.",
      "But in Homs, which has a diverse population of Sunni and Shia Muslims, as well as Christians and Alawites, a relatively peaceful Christmas in the Christian suburb of Fayrouzeh appeared to help assuage some fears.",
      "\u201cWe had a very beautiful holiday even though there was some anxiety before it,\u201d one Fayrouzeh resident, Sarab Kashi, told the AP. \u201cThe guys from HTS volunteered and stood as guards on the door of the churches.\u201d",
      "But whether Syria\u2019s new leadership will be able to maintain that relative calm remains to be seen, with the international community keeping a close eye on the shifting circumstances in Damascus."
