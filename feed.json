      "\"Predator: Badlands\" has topped the North American box office with a $40 million debut, according to studio estimates",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d led all films in North American theaters with a debut of $40 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, a better-than-expected result that slightly lifted the box office from its autumn doldrums.",
      "On the heels of the worst box office weekend of 2025, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d faced little competition from new titles. Not accounting for inflation, the $40 million opening marked a new high for the dreadlocked alien franchise, besting the $38.3 million launch of 2004\u2019s \u201cAlien vs. Predator.\u201d",
      "\u201cPredator: Badlands,\u201d written and directed by Dan Trachtenberg, collected another $40 million overseas for the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s 20th Century Studios. A key factor for \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d is that, with a budget of $105 million, it\u2019s also the most expensive \u201cPredator\u201d film.",
      "\u201cBadlands,\u201d the eighth movie in the franchise that began with 1987\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d offers a novel twist for the sci-fi series. On a remote planet, a young, outcast predator (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) encounters an android researcher (Elle Fanning), and the two set off on a journey. Reviews (85% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been good. Moviegoers gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Good news had lately been hard to find in movie theaters. On Wednesday, AMC Theaters, the largest theater chain, posted a $298.2 million quarterly loss, partly due to a less-than-stellar summer season. But the fall has been worse. Last month was the lowest-grossing October in nearly three decades. Few awards hopefuls have made much of a mark.",
      "This weekend, a new wave hit theaters. But despite plenty of star power, most fell flat.",
      "\u201cDie My Love,\u201d starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, launched with $2.8 million from 1,983 theaters. The film, directed by Lynne Ramsay, stars Lawrence as a new mother and Pattinson as her husband. Mubi plunked down a reported $24 million for \u201cDie My Love\u201d after its debut at the Cannes Film Festival. Audience slammed it with a \u201cD+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cChristy,\u201d starring Sydney Sweeney as the professional boxer Christy Martin, debuted with $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. The film, the first one distributed by production company Black Bear Pictures, has earned Sweeney awards buzz since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.",
      "Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 \u201cNuremberg,\u201d a post-World War II drama about the Nuremberg trials starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, managed to do a bit better. It opened with $4.1 million in 1,802 theaters.",
      "It was slightly edged by the best performer of the newcomers: \u201cSarah\u2019s Oil.\u201d The Amazon MGM release opened with $4.5 million from 2,410 locations. It stars Naya Desir-Johnson as a young Black girl in the early 1900s who learns that her Oklahoma land allotment is rich with oil. \u201cSarah\u2019s Oil\u201d scored a rare \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from ticket buyers.",
      "Arguably the most promising of the prospective awards movies to open in theaters over the weekend was Neon\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value.\u201d The film, a prize-winner at Cannes, directed by Norwegian-Danish filmmaker Joachim Trier, has been tabbed as a major Oscar contender this year. The family drama\u2019s cast includes Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and, in her second movie of the weekend, Elle Fanning. It opened in four theaters with $200,000, giving it a $50,000 per-screen average. That\u2019s the third best of the year.",
      "The debut of \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d sealed the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s fourth straight year of $4 billion in worldwide ticket sales. It also broke a short streak of disappointments for the studio, including \u201cTron: Ares\u201d and \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d With potentially two of the biggest box-office hits of the year still to come in \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d Disney is poised to surpass $5 billion.",

      "PARIS -- The diamond and emerald-studded crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, which was found damaged outside the Louvre after apparently being dropped during the Oct. 19 robbery, will be restored as a symbol of \u201crenaissance,\u201d the museum's director Laurence des Cars said Friday.",
      "Thieves made away with eight objects on display at the Paris museum, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century Queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense. They forced their way through a window into the Apollo Gallery with the help of a freight lift, using disc cutters to cut through display cases and steal the jewels.",
      "Only Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s imperial crown, with more than 1,300 diamonds, was recovered on the day of the robbery outside the museum.",
      "Des Cars said the crown was likely damaged when it was removed from its display case through a \u201csmall cut\u201d made by the disc cutter, rather than when it fell down on the ground.",
      "\u201cAll of the most important pieces, the diamonds and emeralds, are actually still there,\u201d she said in an interview with the France Info news broadcaster. \"A few small pieces of diamonds are missing, but that\u2019s about it,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cone of the eight gold eagles on the crown is missing.\u201d",
      "Des cars confirmed the crown will be restored with financing from patrons who already offered their support.",
      "\u201cWe're going to set up a scientific committee to supervise the restoration and it will be a beautiful symbol of the Louvre\u2019s renaissance,\u201d she said.",

      "Des Cars said she pushed for modernizing the museum soon after she was was named its head in 2021. Problems she listed include \u201cthe obsolescence of our technical facilities, the dilapidation of the building, structural issues related to welcoming visitors and overcrowding in the pyramid, which was designed for four million visitors but now welcomes nine million, and the problem with the display of the Mona Lisa, which is very unsatisfactory.\u201d",
      "Her comments come a day after France's court of auditors urged the Louvre to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority. The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period and conducted before the robbery, said the museum\u2019s investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations,\u201d such as buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience, rather than security.",
      "Des Cars rejected the criticism, arguing that the Louvre is tasked with all missions together.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year.

      "Lea Michele returns to Broadway's Imperial Theatre, where she first heard a song from \u201cChess\u201d as a child",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lea Michele was just a kid actor backstage at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway when she first heard a song from the musical \u201cChess\u201d on a stereo. Some three decades later, she finds herself singing that same tune in the same theater.",
      "The \u201cGlee\u201d and Broadway veteran, who got her professional start in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at age 8, has returned, now a mother and a bankable star, to her old stomping grounds, which coincidentally is the very theater where \u201cChess\u201d made its debut in 1988.",
      "\u201cThe Imperial Theatre really has a soul. Every show that\u2019s ever been in it is absorbed in the walls. It\u2019s a little eerie, but very powerful. Other theaters can feel a little sterile, but this does not feel that way,\u201d she says.",
      "She remembers exactly where she sat the first time she saw \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d \u2014 orchestra left, six rows in \u2014 hearing Paige O\u2019Hara as Fantine sing \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d in the musical that she would soon join, playing Young Cosette and Young Eponine.",
      "\u201cI was in the show and I told my parents, I said \u2018I love this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s really very emotional to be here 30 years later still working, thank God, back at this theater,\u201d she says. The icing on the cake? An electrician on her return simply said: \u201cWelcome home.\u201d",
      "\u201cChess,\u201d which opens Nov. 16 and is set primarily in Bangkok and Budapest during the Cold War, tells the fictional story about two chess grandmasters \u2014 an American played by Aaron Tveit and a Soviet, portrayed by Nicholas Christopher \u2014 facing off to win for their respective nations, a task complicated by the appearance of a woman they both love, played by Michele.",
      "\u201cThis is the hardest character in a lot of ways that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Michele says. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s strong. I don\u2019t have comedy to lean on as a crutch or as a kind of like a protective cloak.\u201d",
      "The show reunites Michele with Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who directed her both in her breakout \u201c Spring Awakening \u201d in 2006 and also in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d in 2022.",
      "Mayer also has great memories of the Imperial Theatre. It was the place where he saw his first Broadway show \u2014 \u201cPippin\u201d in 1976 with Ben Vereen. He was in the back row of the mezzanine, eight seats in from the right aisle. \u201cI sat there and everything came back,\u201d he says.",
      "The show, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, originated as a concept album in 1984 and includes the goosebump-raising \u201cAnthem,\u201d the pop-pulsing \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d\u2014 which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 and the lilting \u201cI Know Him So Well.\u201d",
      "The musical, first staged in London in 1986 and heavily revised for a Broadway production in 1988, has a cult fan base, but the Broadway production was a flop, lasting less than 90 performances. Attempts have been made to resuscitate it over the years with concerts and new stagings. A new story has been written for the latest iteration by screenwriter Danny Strong.",

    "story": [
      "The theft of the Louvre's crown jewels has increased calls for the museum to be more transparent about the colonial origins of the treasures it displays",
      "PARIS -- As French police race to track where the Louvre's stolen crown jewels have gone, a growing chorus wants a brighter light on where they came from.",
      "The artifacts were French, but the gems were not. Their exotic routes to Paris run through the shadows of empire \u2014 an uncomfortable history that France, like other Western nations with treasure-filled museums, has only begun to confront.",
      "The attention sparked by the heist is an opportunity, experts say, to pressure the Louvre and Europe\u2019s great museums to explain their collections' origins more honestly, and it could trigger a broader reckoning over restitutions.",
      "Within hours of the theft, researchers sketched a likely colonial-era map for the materials: sapphires from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), diamonds from India and Brazil, pearls from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and emeralds from Colombia.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make the Louvre robbery less criminal. It does complicate the public's understanding of what was lost.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously no excuse for theft,\u201d said Emiline C.H. Smith, a criminologist at the University of Glasgow who studies heritage crime. \u201cBut many of these objects are entangled with violent, exploitative, colonial histories.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s no credible evidence these specific gems were stolen \u2014 experts say that doesn\u2019t end the argument: What was legal in the imperial age could still mean plunder in today\u2019s lights. In other words, the paperwork of empire doesn\u2019t settle the ethics.",
      "Meanwhile, the heist investigation grinds on. Police have charged suspects, but investigators fear the jewels could be broken up or melted down. They are too symbolic to fence, but easy to monetize for metal and stones.",
      "The Louvre provides scant information about how the gems in the French crown jewels \u2013 showcased in the Apollo Gallery until the theft \u2014 were originally extracted.",
      "For example, the Louvre\u2019s own catalog describes the stolen diadem of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie as set with \u201cCeylon sapphires\u201d in their natural, unheated state, bordered with diamonds in gold. It says nothing about who mined them, how they moved, or under what terms they were taken.",
      "Provenance isn\u2019t always a neutral ledger in Western museums. They sometimes \u201cavoid spotlighting uncomfortable acquisition histories,\u201d Smith said, adding that the lack of clarity about the gems\u2019 origins is likely no accident.",
      "The museum did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The stolen tiaras, necklaces and brooches were crafted in Paris by elite ateliers, and once belonged to 19th-century figures such as Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Queen Hortense, and the wives of two Napoleons, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Their raw materials, however, moved through imperial networks that converted global labor, resources \u2014 and even slavery \u2014 into European prestige, experts say.",
      "Pascal Blanchard, a historian of France\u2019s colonial past, draws a line between craftsmanship and supply. The jewels \u201cwere made in France by French artisans,\u201d he said, but many stones came via colonial circuits and were \u201cproducts of colonial production.\u201d They were traded \u201cunder the legal conditions \u2026 of the time,\u201d ones shaped by empires that siphoned wealth from Africa, Asia and South America.",
      "Some French critics press the point further. They argue that national outcry over loss should sit beside the history of how imperial France acquired the stones that court jewelers later set in gold.",

      "India has repeatedly pressed the U.K. to return the mythologized 106-carat jewel, now set in the Queen Mother\u2019s crown at the Tower of London. It likely originated in India's Golconda diamond belt \u2014 much like the Louvre's dazzling Regent diamond, one that was also legally acquired in imperial times and spared by the Oct. 19 robbers.",
      "The Koh-i-Noor passed from court to court before landing in British hands, where it is hailed in London as a \u201clawful\u201d imperial gift and denounced in India as a prize taken under the shadow of conquest. A 2017 petition to India\u2019s Supreme Court seeking its return was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but the political and moral dispute endures.",
      "France is not Britain, and the Koh-i-Noor is not the Louvre's story. But it frames the questions increasingly applied to 19th-century acquisitions: not only \u201cwas it bought?\u201d but \u201cwho had the power to sell?\u201d On that measure, experts say, even jewels made in France can be considered products of colonial extraction.",
      "The Louvre case lands in a world already primed by other fights. Greece presses Britain to reunite the Parthenon Marbles. Egypt campaigns for the Rosetta Stone in London and the Nefertiti bust in Berlin.",
      "France has moved \u2014 narrowly. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to return parts of Africa\u2019s heritage produced a law enabling the return of 26 royal treasures to Benin and items to Senegal. Madagascar recovered the crown of Queen Ranavalona III through a specific process.",
      "Critics say restitution is structurally blocked: French law forbids removing state-held objects unless Parliament makes a special exception, and risk-averse museums keep the rest behind glass.",
      "They also say that under former Louvre chief Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum's narrow definition of what counts as \u201clooted\u201d \u2014 and its demand for near-legal levels of proof \u2014 created a chilling effect on restitution claims, even as the museum publicly praised transparency. (The Louvre says it follows the law and academic standards.)",
      "Asking museum visitors to marvel at artifacts like the French crown jewels without understanding their social history is dishonest, says Erin L. Thompson, an art-crime scholar in New York. A decolonized approach, she and others argue, would name where such stones came from, how the trade worked, who profited and who paid \u2014 and share authorship with origin communities.",
      "Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna calls the contradiction glaring.",
      "\u201cYes, the irony is profound,\u201d she said of the outcry over last month's Louvre theft, \u201cand it\u2019s central to the conversation about restitution.\u201d She expects the heist will trigger action on restitutions across Western museums and fuel debate about transparency.",
      "At a minimum, Hanna and other experts say, what's needed from museums are stronger words: plain-spoken labels and wall texts that acknowledge where objects came from, how they moved, and at whose expense. It would mean publishing what is known, admitting what isn\u2019t, and inviting contested histories into the gallery \u2014 even when they cloud the shine.",
      "Some offer a practical path.",
      "\u201cTell the honest and complete story,\u201d said Dutch restitution specialist Jos van Beurden. \u201cOpen the windows, not for thieves, but for fresh air.\u201d",

      "Bolle, who performed at the opening ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, is a familiar sight at the Arena, where he travels each summer with his \u201cRoberto Bolle and Friends\u201d annual gala. He is the only talent announced so far.",

      "Thirty years after the death of Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez, the Grammy Museum has announced it is launching a special pop-up exhibit celebrating the Latin music icon",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Thirty years after Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed at 23, regional Mexicana music is now celebrated on the global stage \u2014 no doubt a result of her unending influence.",
      "This year, there have been a number of celebrations for the \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom\u201d singer, including the forthcoming Netflix documentary \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d Now, there's another reason to celebrate the singer known to fans as Selena: In 2026, the Grammy Museum will launch a special pop-up exhibit celebrating the Latin music icon.",
      "\u201cSelena: From Texas to the World\u201d runs from Jan. 15 to March 16 at the museum in downtown Los Angeles.",
      "The exhibit was curated in close collaboration with Suzette Quintanilla, Selena\u2019s sister and president of Q Productions. It will display personal artifacts from the Selena Museum in Corpus Christi, Texas. The exhibit will mark the first time these items have been shown outside of Selena's home state.",
      "Suzette Quintanilla \u201creally handpicked the items that we\u2019re going to have the pleasure of displaying in the pop up,\u201d said Grammy Museum curator Kelsey Goelz in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cSelena\u2019s legacy is not going anywhere. The conversation is still going. So, you know, why not start allowing fans to see some more stuff?\u201d",
      "All of the items at the Grammy Museum pop-up have been sourced directly from the Selena Museum, save for guitars lent from the personal collection of Chris P\u00e9rez, the lead guitarist of Selena y Los Dinos who was married to the singer.",
      "About 15 items are coming from the Selena Museum, says Goelz.",
      "\u201cI think the most spectacular (item) would be her Grammy gown that she wore to the '94 Grammys, when she won best Mexican/Mexican American album. It's a very beautiful white beaded gown,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then also the leather outfit she wore on the cover (of her 1994 album) \u2018Amor Prohibido,\u2019 the ruffle collar, the hoop earrings. Just, like, these little things, like the hoop earrings, make Selena, Selena. We\u2019re also getting the microphone she used in her final performance that still has her lipstick on it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just so intimate and it\u2019s so special to get to bring this to LA,\u201d she continued.",
      "It's an appropriate home for a Selena exhibit: In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Selena's Grammy and Lifetime Achievement Award will be on display at the Grammy Museum, as well as hand-drawn fashion designs from the singer's teen years.",

This exhibit is a beautiful tribute to her spirit, her culture and the unwavering love she had for fans.\u201d",

She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",

      "The report is the 20th edition of the annual tracking by GLAAD and charts a remarkable leap from just 47 LGBTQ+ characters in the first study.

      "PARIS -- France's court of auditors urged the Louvre museum to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority, in a report conducted before the Oct. 19 jewels heist that noted major delays in the renovation of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report by the Cour des Comptes comes after a series of failings and security issues came to light following the robbery of the $102-million worth Crown Jewels that shocked the world. The thieves used a truck-mounted basket lift to reach a window of the Apollo Gallery and fled with the trove within minutes.",
      "\u201cThe theft of the crown jewels is undoubtedly a deafening alarm bell,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, head of the court of auditors, said at a news conference.",
      "The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period, said the museum's investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations\u201d like buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience. That was \u201cat the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical installations, particularly safety and security systems,\u201d it said.",
      "A plan to modernize security equipment was being studied since 2018 but its implementation kept being delayed, the report said. Actual technical work was only to start next year and was planned to be fully implemented by 2032.",
      "\"The pace is far too slow,\" Moscovici said.",
      "The court of auditors believes security can be improved without hiring more staff at the museum, Moscovici added. A previous assessment shows that the Oct. 19 heist was made possible by outdated security systems, not because of lack of staff, he said.",
      "The cost for security modernization is estimated to 83 million euros ($95 million), out of which only 3 million euros ($3.5 million) have been invested between 2018 and 2024, according to the report.",
      "The museum said that over the past three years, 134 digital cameras have been installed to supplement or replace outdated cameras throughout the museum, the report noted.",

That means reducing art acquisition and saving on museum rooms' renovation projects, the report said.",
      "In response to the audit, the Louvre on Thursday said it \u201cregretted\u201d that the report did not take into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the 2024 Paris Olympics, which the museum said impacted certain decisions.",
      "The Louvre said it agrees with most of the court of auditors\u2019 recommendations and already made similar proposals. It noted that the Oct. 19 theft occurred weeks before planned security improvements were to start being implemented.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year. It is estimated it would cost up to 800 million euros ($933 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the famed Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "Last week, Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the Louvre will install streetside anti-ramming and anti-intrusion devices in the next two months, following a provisional investigation that found a \u201cchronic, structural underestimation\u201d of the risk of theft at the Paris landmark.",
      "Dati acknowledged \u201csecurity gaps,\u201d refused the resignation of the museum director and cited four failings: underestimated risk, underequipped security, ill-suited governance and \u201cobsolete\u201d protocols.",
      "Four suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested last week, including three believed to be members of the team of four that was filmed using a basket lift to reach the museum\u2019s window. They face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. The jewels have not been recovered, authorities said.",

      "Joachim Trier's \u201cSentimental Value\" builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life",
      "NEW YORK -- Joachim Trier, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Renate Reinsve have gathered in a backstage room at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall. A screen on the wall shows the crowd inside, raptly watching their film, \u201cSentimental Value.\u201d They have all consciously sat facing away from the movie.",
      "But if there\u2019s one moment from the film they sometimes sneak in for, it\u2019s the final scene. At festivals, they\u2019ve sometimes taken the stage for a Q&A with tears still in their eyes.",
      "\u201cThe ending always moves me,\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd says. \u201cOn the paper, it really scared me. It could have been sentimental hell, not \u2018Sentimental Value.\u2019 What was important to me was that nothing was resolved. I hate the word closure. There\u2019s no closure in life. But there\u2019s something more beautiful.\u201d",
      "\u201cSentimental Value,\u201d written and directed by Trier, builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life. By the time the film reaches its crescendo, a simple exchange of looks is enough to leave you stirred to your core.",
      "That effect isn\u2019t new to fans of Trier\u2019s previous films, like \u201cOslo, August 31st\u201d or his previous one, \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d which starred Reinsve. But \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d which Neon opens in theaters Friday, is uniquely personal statement for Trier that also happens \u2014 because it\u2019s so much about the intermingling of life and art, and how one enriches the other \u2014 to resonate deeply with his two stars.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd plays the venerated filmmaker Gustav Borg, who has long been estranged from his family. But after the death of his ex-wife, Borg comes back into the lives of his daughters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Like her father, Nora is tough and stubborn, and her outlet is in performance. Gustav wants her to star in his new and highly autobiographical film, a project that also draws the interest of an American starlet (Elle Fanning).",
      "Both Reinsve and Skarsg\u00e5rd have direct similarities to their character. Reinsve, 37, experienced a breakthrough in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd, 74, is the father of eight, many of them actors. But \u201cSentimental Value,\" the Grand Prix winner at the Cannes Film Festival, has deeper reverberations for them, and for Trier. In a conversation that, like one of Trier's films, featured embraces and tears and the gratification of feeling seen, the three reflected on making a film poised between life and fiction.",
      "REINSVE: For me it was nerve-racking because he knows me so well. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to find. He\u2019s very smart and very wise, so what he finds is probably the truth.",
      "TRIER: The revealing of something in art is what interests us. So one might think I know too well what to do, but it\u2019s a compliment to these actors that they\u2019re able to come into a position of control and craft and yet (laughs) unhinge themselves in unusual ways in front of the camera. You want that. You yearn for it. What, you were worried I\u2019ll reveal something you don\u2019t want to show?",
      "REINSVE: Yeah.",
      "TRIER: But you are so brave.",
      "REINSVE: But I became brave with you. In the theater, I worked on a lot of characters that you build and construct. You\u2019re making it big for the audience. Playing Julie in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d you encouraged me to let go of that. I remember one of our first conversations, I was worried because I didn\u2019t know how to build her. And you said, \u201cBut do you have to? Can\u2019t you just find it in you?\u201d For me that was so scary.",
      "SKARSGARD: It\u2019s flattering in a way, but you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s flattering. The character on the paper wasn\u2019t really what he is in the film. I remember I said to you, \u201cCan\u2019t you get over your problems with your father?\u201d",
      "TRIER: And I said, (voice intentionally squeaking) \u201cI\u2019m over them!\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: The hard edges of the character were very obvious in the script, but the compassion wasn\u2019t.",
      "TRIER: When you came into it, that solved it. I mean, character is something that happens with actors.",

      "REINSVE: Before I worked with Joachim, I played a lot of characters that keep their emotions really inside and aren\u2019t able to let them out. Joachim built that trust because of how he worked and how he sees people. It was safe to let go of something in there. He sits beside the camera and whispers. He can tap into the actor\u2019s instinct. I\u2019m a person or an actor who has a lot of resistance, which is good for the dynamic in a character. But it can also hinder you from letting go of something you need to. Joachim sits there and knows what the actor wants to do and he says, \u201cLet yourself do it.\u201d It feels like we\u2019re doing it together.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019ve always seen acting as a way of being able to do what you can\u2019t do in your private life. I\u2019m pretty reserved, in a way. I am!",
      "REINSVE: Not with us.",
      "TRIER: I hear you say that!",
      "SKARSGARD: But it\u2019s fantastic to have this art where you can also test everything. Can I feel that? Wow! Yeah! It\u2019s like a child playing in a sandbox. It\u2019s the same mechanism. They play other people from day one. Maybe it\u2019s evolutionary: mimicking the adults to survive.",
      "REINSVE: We\u2019re still children mimicking the adults.",
      "TRIER: It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have trouble making art of a personal sort. They sing a strange, sensual love song in a band and they\u2019re shy that their parents will hear it. Or you write a book that\u2019s transgressive. I'm the opposite. I\u2019m rather proud that I've done personal films because my kids will see them. Maybe they\u2019ll see them and think they\u2019re stupid or my opinions are weird. That\u2019s OK, but they were me. I think this film came out of a climate in my life when I was thinking about these things.",
      "TRIER: That was when I knew I had the film I wanted to make, when I had the idea of ending. We were all nervous about it. The last day of the shoot. I\u2019m so proud of you two. My dream came true.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019m glad that you say I have a rhythm because I really care about rhythm. Scenes are to me like music pieces. He wrote this for me and the (expletive) and he\u2019s seen what I\u2019ve been longing for: the acting between the lines. (Skarsg\u00e5rd begins tearing up.) I\u2019m getting emotional.",
      "TRIER: I think you are incredibly smart with screenwriting, so much so that I was nervous going in. You\u2019re very blunt in a very warm way. You say \u201c(Expletive) this\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t need this.\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: It's being allowed to do a film that\u2019s not written in a head of a director. He\u2019s exploring it. There\u2019s nothing like it. (Again Skarsg\u00e5rd gets emotional before shaking his head.) Enough!",
      "REINSVE: This is it. I feel this moment is it. It brings to the surface something we're longing for. The human mind needs to create a narrative and make things black or white to protect itself. That\u2019s a problem in the world, being so polarized. The wisdom is being safe enough to create a space to let anything happen and see the nuances between people. There are no sets like Joachim\u2019s sets. It's a process \u2014 what is it? Art creates life, imitates\u2026",
      "SKARSGARD: You never get it right.",
      "REINSVE: I never get it right. But it\u2019s both ways! Here, art imitates life, life imitates art. It\u2019s both ways.",

      "A new film, \u201cNuremberg,\u201d starring Russell Crowe and Rami Malek, explores the interactions between Nazi leader Hermann G\u00f6ring and army psychiatrist Dr. Douglas M",
      "NEW YORK -- A once-overlooked army psychiatrist tasked with analyzing Hermann G\u00f6ring and other Nazis accused of war crimes is getting the kind of attention that he had sought in his lifetime.",
      "\u201cNuremberg,\u201d starring Russell Crowe as G\u00f6ring, centers on the Nazi military commander's conversations with Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, played by Rami Malek. Kelley's mission was to determine whether G\u00f6ring and more than 20 other Nazi officials captured at the end of World War II were fit to stand trial in Nuremberg. The movie is directed by James Vanderbilt and based on a 2013 book, \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d by Jack El-Hai, who helped Vanderbilt write the screenplay.",
      "Through many hours at facilities in Luxembourg and Nuremberg, Kelley will find himself alternately taken and frightened by a man notorious for his role in the Nazis' attempted conquest of Europe and beyond. G\u00f6ring turns out to be unexpectedly good and clever company, if not convincing in his assertion that he knew nothing of Hitler\u2019s worst atrocities and cared only to restore Germany to greatness after its humiliating defeat in World War I.",

Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Kelley, an ambitious and demonstrative man who took his own life in 1958, might never have inspired a major Hollywood production had his name not turned up while El-Hai was working on a previous book. While writing about Dr. Walter Freeman, who helped make lobotomy a common treatment, El-Hai came upon an encounter between Freeman and Kelley at an American Psychiatric Association gathering in the late 1930s.",
      "\u201cWhat struck Freeman about Kelley was that Kelley was not there to present a paper or do anything like that. He was there to give a magic show on the stage to entertain all his fellow psychiatrists,\u201d El-Hai told The Associated Press. \u201cSo a few years after I finished \u2018The Lobotomy,\u2019 I decided to find out what I could about Dr. Kelley\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "El-Hai got in touch with Kelley's eldest child, Doug, who gave him access to a trove of his father's archives, some 15 boxes containing everything from medical records to a package of cookies Nazi leader Rudolf Hess refused to eat out of fear they had been poisoned. In \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d El-Hai follows Kelley's life from his rise in the psychiatric profession through the controversies of his years after returning home from Europe, starting with his contention that in the U.S. there are people who, to gain power, \u201cwould willingly climb over the corpses of half of the American public.\u201d",
      "As a professor of criminology at the University of California, Berkeley, Kelley was a showman in the classroom who cracked jokes, drew elaborate designs and performed magic tricks. As a consultant to the Berkeley Police Department, he openly challenged the competence of law enforcement officials and was eventually monitored by the FBI, which suspected him of political subversion. He also gave lectures around the country and published a book about his wartime findings, \u201c22 Cells in Nuremberg,\u201d which sold few copies and is long out of print.",
      "His death echoed the suicide of G\u00f6ring, who 12 years earlier had taken a cyanide pill he\u2019d hidden in his cell. G\u00f6ring\u2019s life ended in secret, Kelley\u2019s in front of his family. After a loud argument with his wife, he rushed upstairs to his study, reemerged with a cyanide capsule in his hand and shouted \u201cI don\u2019t have to take this anymore!\u201d Kelley left no explanation. His son, according to El-Hai, believed he had been overcome by his \u201cemotions and inner pain.\u201d",

      "During a recent interview with The Associated Press, El-Hai spoke of Kelley's findings, the parallels between Kelley and G\u00f6ring and why he believes the story resonates now. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "EL-HAI: One of Kelley\u2019s central questions that he had going into this work was the question that was strongly of interest to me: Did these men who were all defendants in this first Nuremberg trial share any psychiatric disorders, illness, his personality traits, any of that? And Kelley found to his disappointment that they did not \u2014 none of them, with the possible exception of (German Labor Front leader) Robert Ley, who killed himself before the trial. They certainly had neuroses, but many people who function normally have neuroses. That made him afraid and made him believe that people like that are in our population in far greater numbers than any of us.",
      "They were all people who believed that the ends justify the means and that most of them were, on a personal level, on a quest for power. And that was more important than ideology. So they would attach themselves to an ideology that allowed them to rise and to crush anybody else who got in their way.",
      "El-HAI: There was very little remorse.",
      "El-HAI: He wanted to be treated as a head of state, which he considered himself to be. He said to some of his fellow defendants, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, before much time goes by, there will be statues of us all over Germany.\u201d",
      "El-HAI: Especially if the alternative was to be hanged, which they all considered to be an execution method for a common criminal. Kelley observed that by poisoning himself right before the execution, G\u00f6ring was putting a thumb in the eye of the American authorities. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do with what you want to do with me.\u201d And that really resonated with Kelley.",
      "EL-HAI: It was not a concern of mine. As a result of the courtroom scenes that are in the second half of the film, G\u00f6ring loses a lot of his luster, as happened in the real courtroom. Rami, in playing the counterpoint to the villainous G\u00f6ring, maybe had to think about it more, because I have always seen those two characters as being more similar than not similar.",
      "When I was writing the book, I often discussed with Dr. Kelley\u2019s son, Doug, what it must have been like for them to be in this jail cell together, and we always jokingly characterized them as King Kong versus Godzilla. They were both egomaniacs. They were both absolutely certain of their rightness. And they were both socially charming and highly intelligent.",
      "EL-HAI: I was OK with James Vanderbilt\u2019s approach from the start. Whenever he would send me a draft of the screenplay, I didn\u2019t see it as my job to find inaccuracies and things that weren\u2019t factual. I know movies are a different medium from books and that what makes a book good is not the same as what makes a movie good. And so what we\u2019ve ended up with in \u201cNuremberg,\u201d I think, is a movie that is mostly factual, and more important, delivers the messages that are very close to the messages in my book.",
      "Douglas Kelley\u2019s message was that Nazism, fascism, or whatever you want to call it, has always had the potential for coming alive in our country. He saw it immediately when he came back from Europe, and it\u2019s certainly easier to find now.",

      "SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a long-established cinema subgenre: two opposed people reluctantly stuck together with a common purpose.",
      "The film, the seventh in the franchise (not counting the \u201cAlien vs. Predator\u201d offshoots), has the buddy comedy energy that comes with that dynamic. It also belongs to the narrower subgenre of people quite literally stuck together, like 1958's \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d in which Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis were fugitives united by chains.",
      "And, in a scenario that provided special challenges for stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a still narrower subset it may share only with \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d: movies with a broken android worn like a backpack by a tall and powerful creature as they face peril in a strange corner of space.",
      "\u201cThe real physical inspiration for it was C-3PO strapped to Chewbacca\u2019s back,\u201d director Dan Trachtenberg told The Associated Press in an interview where he was joined by the film's two stars. \u201cBut I think the fun of this is that it\u2019s not Chewbacca. It\u2019s not a friendly, well-intentioned creature, it\u2019s a Predator.\u201d",
      "The apt working title of the movie, which will be released Friday by 20th Century Studios, was \u201cBackpack.\u201d",
      "For much of the New Zealand shoot, Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi were every bit as close as they appear to be in the film, where the top half of her artificially intelligent character, Thia, was back-to-back with Schuster-Koloamatangi's young Predator, Dek, who is out to prove himself on a hunt against a seemingly unkillable megamonster.",
      "\u201cHis Predator braids would, like, whip me in the face all the time in our action sequences,\u201d Fanning said with a laugh.",

      "There are three types of Recording Academy memberships: Grammy U, professional and voting memberships. The latter includes performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, instrumentalists and beyond. Those are the members who determine Grammy winners each year.",

      "But there are a few ways around some of those requirements: If you are a current year\u2019s Grammy winner or nominee, you do not need to provide a recommendation from someone in the industry. If you\u2019ve been nominated for a Grammy in the last five years, you do not need to provide proof of your credits.",
      "Entries must adhere to the specific qualifications of the categories they are submitted into. Rules and guidelines can be found at Grammy.com.",
      "There are also frequent changes made to categories and fields. In 2026, there have been a few: best country album has been divided into best contemporary country album and best traditional country album. The best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories have also been combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.",
      "Most importantly: Recordings and music videos must also be submitted within the Grammy eligibility window, which for the 2026 award show means work released between Aug. 31, 2024 \u2013 Aug. 30, 2025.",
      "The category of new artist is constantly evolving, trying to capture the zeitgeist each year as the process of categorizing fame gets more complicated. The Grammy rules currently say nominations hinge on whether \u201cthe artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence\u201d \u2014 and it delegates that determination to a screening committee. Eligible artists must have released at least five singles or one album, but there is no longer a maximum. That\u2019s why someone like, say, Sabrina Carpenter \u2014 who broke out in the summer of \u201cEspresso\u201d \u2014 found herself up for the best new artist trophy in 2025 despite being on her sixth full-length release.",
      "And this year, the category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.",
      "The Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations announced on Friday. It will be broadcast live on CBS and can be streamed on demand via Paramount+.",

Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart.",
      "They\u2019re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a \u201cflare\u201d for no apparent reason.",
      "Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s also can harm major organs, for example.",
      "Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together. There are efforts to improve: The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.",
      "The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou,\u201d what scientists call tolerance.",
      "Sometimes confused immune cells or antibodies slip through, or the peacemakers can\u2019t calm things down after a battle. If the system can\u2019t spot and fix the problem, autoimmune diseases gradually develop.",

      "Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren\u2019t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some \u201cenvironmental\u201d trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.",
      "Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury \u2014 but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.",
      "Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women\u2019s vulnerability.",
      "But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn\u2019t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.",
      "Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.",
      "According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That\u2019s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.",
      "Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.",

      "Doctor after doctor misdiagnosed or shrugged off Ruth Wilson\u2019s rashes, swelling, fevers and severe pain for six years. She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.",
      "That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman\u2019s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her immune system had been attacking her own body all that time and nobody caught it.",
      "\u201cI just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,\u201d she said.",
      "Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms \u2014 and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues\u2019 gallery of autoimmune diseases that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide \u2013 hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine\u2019s biggest mysteries.",
      "Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They\u2019re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones \u2013 in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.",
      "It's a daunting task. That friendly fire ravages nerves in multiple sclerosis, inflames joints in rheumatoid arthritis, dries out the eyes and mouth in Sj\u00f6gren's disease, destroys insulin production in Type 1 diabetes, weakens muscles in myositis and myasthenia gravis \u2014 and in lupus, it can cause body-wide havoc.",
      "The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that\u2019s often invisible.",
      "\u201cYou look normal. People see you and they don\u2019t think you have this horrible disease,\u201d said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.",
      "While there\u2019s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.",
      "In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients' own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It's called CAR-T therapy and early results with these \u201cliving drugs\u201d are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.",
      "And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they\u2019ll need insulin. Citing that \u201ctantalizing evidence,\u201d the NIH\u2019s new five-year plan for autoimmune research \u2014 if it gets funded \u2014 urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",
      "Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells \u2014 how to distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.",
      "Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that once protected our ancestors from long-ago threats including the Black Death but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.",
      "But \u201cgenes are not everything,\u201d said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",
      "Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn't guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.",
      "\u201cAt some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, \u2018That\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle any more of these insults,\u2019\u201d said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.",
      "And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That's especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.",
      "Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.",
      "Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog \u2014 difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking \u2014 wax and wane.",
      "Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.",
      "Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.",

      "They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they\u2019re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.",
      "How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.",
      "But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.",
      "\u201cWe think that\u2019s a fundamental initial process,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.\u201d",
      "Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan\u2019s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key \u2014 by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.",
      "But neutrophils don\u2019t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients\u2019 blood won\u2019t show how they went awry \u2014 something Kwong\u2019s baby neutrophils may aid.",
      "Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.",
      "That suggests \u201clupus is not a single disease,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWhat we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.\"",
      "How to subtype lupus isn't clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.",
      "Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients' joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.",
      "It \u201cchanged how we think about the disease,\u201d said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.",
      "Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs \u2014 and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.",
      "One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she'd answer some medical students' questions. Wilson remembers many knew \u201cwhat lupus looks like in a textbook\u201d but not the patient perspective.",
      "\u201cI realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.\u201d",
      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",
      "Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are \u201conly capturing half the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.\u201d",
      "While her doctor isn't recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. For a long time, \u201cI never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.\u201d",

Luis Cassiano, who's lived here more than 30 years, says he's getting worried as heat waves become more frequent and fierce.",
      "In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning \u2014 Cassiano is one \u2014 can't always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor's, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.",
      "\u201cThe sun in the summer nowadays is scary,\u201d Cassiano said.",
      "As world leaders come to Brazil for climate talks, people like Cassiano are the ones with the most at stake. Poor communities are often more vulnerable to hazards like extreme heat and supersized storms and less likely to have the resources to cope than wealthier places.",
      "Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions. They also need to find the political will to implement them, as well as come up with the billions of dollars needed to adapt everything from harvests to houses to better withstand human-caused climate change.",
      "All of it is sorely needed for the 1.1 billion people around the world who live in acute poverty, according to the United Nations.",
      "That's why many have lauded the choice of Belem, a relatively poor city, to host these talks.",
      "\u201cI am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,\u201d said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.",
      "It's not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.",
      "People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.",
      "They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don\u2019t have savings, that\u2019s really devastating,\u201d Brandon said.",

      "Cheney, who died Monday due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, had his first heart attack at the unusually young age of 37. He would go on to survive four more before his heart declined enough to qualify for that transplant.",
      "Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer and Cheney's decades of health problems illustrate how heart trouble can accumulate \u2014 as well as the varied treatments.",
      "Over the years, Cheney underwent quadruple bypass surgery to reroute blood flow around clogged heart arteries as well as less invasive artery-clearing angioplasties. He had a pacemaker implanted to monitor his heartbeat. He also experienced blood vessel problems in his legs.",
      "Heart attacks damage the heart's muscle, eventually making it harder to pump properly. After Cheney's fifth heart attack in 2010, he acknowledged \u201cincreasing congestive heart failure.\u201d He received another implant, a small pump called a \u201cleft ventricular assist device\u201d or LVAD.

Cheney was older than a typical heart transplant recipient; most are 50 to 64 years old. But he was one of 362 people age 65 or older who received a new heart in 2012, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, or OPTN.",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure yet many are never placed on the transplant list, in part because of the organ shortage. According to the organ network, 4,572 people received a heart transplant last year. That number of has grown gradually since Cheney's \u2014 there were 2,378 transplants in 2012.

      "Illegal gold mining is growing in Ghana, one of the world's top gold producers",
      "JEMA, Ghana -- As day broke in a remote part of western Ghana, a priest, farmers and other residents combed through the forests, looking for signs of illegal gold mining.",
      "They have done this for the past year as part of a grassroots task force created to combat the mining that has poisoned rivers in one of the world's largest gold producing countries.",
      "The group is also driven by the sight of Ghana's unemployed youth being attracted to illegal mining and the elusive promise of quick wealth. Meanwhile, the economy suffers: Ghana has lost $11.4 billion in the last five years to gold smuggling, the development nonprofit Swissaid said this year.",
      "The task force's 14 members call themselves the Jema Anti-Galamsey Advocacy, and their arrests of suspected illegal miners have sparked debate in Ghana\u2019s Western North region over their potential abuse of power.",

      "As of January 2024, illegal miners were present in 44 of the country\u2019s 288 forest reserves, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources data show. It said nine of them were \u201ccompletely taken by armed thugs.\u201d",
      "Since 2015, the Jema community of about 15,000 people has banned all mining on its land, empowered by a law that grants local chiefs powers to make and enforce customary law. Chiefs and the heads of clans and families serve as land custodians.",
      "The new task force usually patrols water bodies and the Jema Forest Reserve, wielding sticks in place of guns, at least once a week, watching for changes in water color as a sign of mining activity upstream and for new clearings in the forests.",
      "When it receives a tip-off from villagers, it arrests the suspects and hands them over to the district police office. Such arrests are allowed by laws that grant powers to citizens to make arrests in certain cases.",
      "So far, the group has arrested two Nigerien nationals caught attempting to mine gold in the forest. The court case has proceeded slowly, and villagers seek the establishment of special courts to try illegal miners.",
      "Task force members say they are filling a void left by a lack of government enforcement.",
      "\u201cAll our water bodies that take their source here are clean because of our strong resistance to galamsey,\u201d said Joseph Blay, a Catholic priest and Jema resident who helped to form the task force.",

      "The typhoon could cover two-thirds of the Southeast Asian archipelago with its 1,800-kilometer- (1,118-mile-) wide rain and wind band, forecasters said.

      "CAIRO -- Tens of thousands of Sudanese have fled to overcrowded camps to escape reported atrocities by a paramilitary force since it captured el-Fasher in the western Darfur region, an aid group said Saturday, and the U.N. human rights chief warned that many others are still trapped.",
      "Those who reach shelter in Tawila, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from el-Fasher, find themselves stranded in a barren area with barely enough tents, many of them improvised from patched tarps and sheets, according to a video posted by the group Sudan\u2019s IDPs and Refugee Camps. It shows children running across the area as a few adults carry a large pot of food, hoping it will be enough to feed the growing crowds of displaced.",
      "Since the Rapid Support Forces, RSF, seized el-Fasher from the rival military Oct. 26, more than 16,200 people have fled to the camps in Tawila, said Adam Rojal, spokesperson for the aid group. The International Organization for Migration estimates that around 82,000 people had fled the city and surrounding areas as of Nov. 4, heading to safe spots including Tawila, an area already overcrowded with the displaced from previous attacks, with some making the journey on foot.",
      "The RSF and the Sudanese army have been at war since April 2023, following simmering tensions over control of Africa's third-largest nation. At least 40,000 people have been killed, according to the World Health Organization, though the actual toll might be many times higher. Some 12 million people have been displaced, and nearly half the population are facing acute food insecurity.",
      "Last week, the RSF seized el-Fasher after an 18-month siege. The paramilitary rampaged through the Saudi Hospital in the city, killing over 450 people, according to the WHO, and went house to house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults. The RSF has denied killing anyone at the Saudi hospital, but testimonies from those fleeing, online videos and satellite images offer an apocalyptic vision of the attack.",
      "The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Friday that 300 people arrived in Tawila on Thursday alone after fleeing el-Fasher. MSF teams reported \u201cextremely high levels of malnutrition among children and adults.\u201d",
      "The displaced in Tawila are in urgent need of food, medicine, shelter materials and psychosocial support, Rojal told The Associated Press. He said that families often survive on just two meals a day \u2014 and sometimes only one.",

Early this week, a drone attack in el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan province, killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens more.",

      "\u201cThese events not only deepen Sudan\u2019s humanitarian crisis but also signal the RSF\u2019s growing capacity to expand toward central Sudan, threatening to reverse the success of the Sudanese armed forces and returning the violence to the relatively calm central Sudan,\u201d said Birru.",
      "On Thursday, the RSF said it has agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by a U.S.-led mediator group known as the Quad. Meanwhile, the army said it welcomes the Quad's proposal, but will only agree to it if RSF withdraw from civilian areas and give up their weapons.",

      "Local workers at some American military bases in Europe are feeling the impact of the U.S. government shutdown",
      "MADRID -- The longest U.S. government shutdown on record is doing more than grind activities to a halt at home; an ocean away in Europe, local workers at U.S. military bases have started to feel the pain.",
      "At least 2,000 people working at overseas bases in Europe have had their salaries interrupted since the shutdown began almost six weeks ago. In some cases, governments hosting the U.S. bases have stepped in to foot the bill, expecting the United States to eventually make good. In others, including in Italy and Portugal, workers have simply kept working unpaid as the gridlock in Washington drags on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an absurd situation because nobody has responses, nobody feels responsible,\u201d said Angelo Zaccaria, a union coordinator at the Aviano Air Base in northeastern Italy.",
      "\u201cThis is having dramatic effects on us Italian workers,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "The jobs foreign nationals do at U.S. bases around the world range from food service, construction, logistics, maintenance and other, more specialized roles. In some cases, foreign workers are employed by private companies hired by the U.S. government while others are direct hires.",
      "How local employees are paid varies by country and is based on specific agreements the U.S. government has with each host nation, said Amber Kelly-Herard, a public affairs spokesperson for the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa.",
      "During the shutdown, Kelly-Herard said local employees were expected to continue to perform their jobs in accordance with their work contracts.",
      "The AP reached out to the Pentagon with multiple questions on the pay disruption, but was only provided a brief statement that did not acknowledge it.",
      "\u201cWe value the important contributions of our local national employees around the world,\u201d it said. The official declined to answer any follow-up questions.",
      "In Germany, the government has stepped in to pay the salaries of nearly 11,000 civilian employees that work on U.S. military bases, the nation's finance ministry said in a statement. American facilities in Germany include the Ramstein Air Base, a critical hub for operations in the Mideast and Africa and headquarters to the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa.",
      "Workers in other countries have not been so fortunate.",
      "More than 4,600 Italian nationals work at the five U.S. bases in Italy, said union coordinator Zaccaria. Of those, over 900 local employees at U.S. bases in Aviano and Vicenza, and another 400 workers at a base in Livorno have not received their salaries since the shutdown began.",
      "\u201cWe are waiting for urgent responses, as there are workers struggling to pay their mortgages, to support their children or even to pay the fuel to come to work,\u201d Zaccaria said. He said the union had asked the Italian government to intervene but that, in the meantime, those affected were continuing to show up to work.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we see no political will to solve this situation, but we\u2019re asking the Italian government to intervene,\" he said.",

      "Terra said unpaid staff are still turning up because furloughs aren\u2019t legally recognized in a U.S.-Portugal agreement on the base. Staying away could leave them open to disciplinary proceedings, she added.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul have ended without agreement, with the sides trading blame for the breakdown in negotiations aimed at easing border tensions and upholding a fragile ceasefire, officials said Saturday.",
      "Tensions have escalated in recent weeks following deadly border fighting that killed dozens of soldiers and civilians. The violence erupted after explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9, which Afghanistan's Taliban government said were drone strikes conducted by Pakistan and vowed to avenge. The clashes subsided after Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Oct. 19, which remains tenuously in place.",
      "Afghanistan's government spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, blamed Pakistan for the talks' failure, saying that \u201cPakistan\u2019s demands in the negotiations were unreasonable and the talks could not proceed, the meeting ended and the talks are at a standstill for now.\u201d",
      "Speaking during a press conference from the southern Afghan city of Kandahar Saturday, Mujahid said Afghanistan \u201c(does) not want insecurity in the region, and entering into war is not our first choice,\u201d but he noted that \u201cif war breaks out, we have the right to defend ourselves.\u201d",
      "Earlier, he had reiterated in a written statement that Afghanistan \u201cwill not allow anyone to use its territory against another country, nor permit actions that undermine its sovereignty or security.\u201d",
      "The two-day talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, were the third round of peace negotiations that were viewed as one of the most significant diplomatic efforts between the two neighbors since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan 2021. Despite intense back-channel diplomacy, officials said discussions stalled late Friday without tangible progress.",
      "Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told the private Geo News channel late Friday that the \u201ctalks are over\u201d and that the Pakistani delegation was returning home with \u201cno plan for any future meetings.\u201d He added that the ceasefire would remain in place as long as \u201cit is not violated from the Afghan side.\u201d",
      "Pakistan has repeatedly accused Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers of harboring the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group responsible for a surge in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries.",
      "Although separate from Afghanistan\u2019s ruling Taliban, the TTP is closely allied with it and has been emboldened since the Taliban\u2019s 2021 takeover of Kabul.",

Pakistan\u2019s military acknowledged losing 23 troops in the fighting.",
      "The violence prompted Qatar to invite delegations from both sides to Doha, where they agreed to a ceasefire on Oct. 19. It was followed by six days of talks in Istanbul, which resulted in an agreement to extend the truce and hold a third round on Nov. 6 and 7 \u2014 talks that ultimately failed to produce any breakthrough.",
      "Since then, Pakistan has kept all of its border crossings with Afghanistan closed, though it partially reopened the main Torkham crossing last week to allow stranded Afghan refugees to return home.",
      "The closure, imposed on Oct. 12, has disrupted vital trade and transit routes and stranded thousands of people. Hundreds of trucks loaded with goods remain backed up on both sides of the frontier, cutting off one of the busiest economic arteries linking South and Central Asia.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- When a male driver from a popular rideshare app asked Ninfa Fuentes for her phone number during a ride through Mexico City, she froze. But when he repeatedly pressed her about her Valentine\u2019s Day plans, a rush of terror flooded her body.",
      "What should have been a quiet ride home at the end of the workday three years ago turned into a nightmare that many women in Mexico experience daily: holding their breath until they know they've made it home alive.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was dying,\u201d Fuentes, 48, said. An international economics researcher and a survivor of sexual violence, she has not used public transportation or ride-hailing services since.",
      "The conversation around startling levels of sexual harassment and gender-based violence came roaring back this week after Mexico\u2019s first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum, was captured in video being groped by a drunk man.",
      "Following the incident, Sheinbaum said she had pressed charges against the man and unveiled a plan to make sexual harassment a crime across all Mexican states \u2014 a bid to make it easier for women to report such assaults in a country where an average of 10 women are killed daily.",
      "After her frightening rideshare app experience, Fuentes turned to AmorrAs, a self-managed feminist network that provides safe transportation \u2014 and support \u2014 for women in Mexico City and its suburbs.",
      "AmorrAs seeks to offer a solution to the endemic problem of sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based violence that women routinely face on Mexico\u2019s rideshare apps and public transit.",
      "The network was founded by 29-year-old Karina Alba following the 2022 killing of Debanhi Escobar, who was found dead days after getting out of a taxi on a dark highway in the northern city of Monterrey.",
      "Alba founded AmorrAs with the hope of providing safe rides for women, choosing her mother, taxi driver Ruth Rojas, to be the network\u2019s first driver. The network now has more than 20 women-only \u201cally\u201d drivers, serving more than 2,000 women per year.",
      "\u201cMy dream was to contribute to society in some way,\" said Alba. \u201cI decided to do so by creating a safe space for women, one where they can live with dignity and free from violence.\u201d",
      "On a recent afternoon, 38-year-old Dian Colmenero received a WhatsApp message from Alba confirming that the woman she was going to drive was waiting at her workplace. On the receiving end, the passenger read a message with the trip details, her \u201cally\u201d driver\u2019s name and number, and a reassuring pink heart emoji. Her \u201cally\u201d driver would be with her soon.",
      "For security reasons, women have to schedule their rides with AmorrAs in advance by filling a form. The price for each ride then varies based on the distance traveled.",
      "Colmenero, who works in marketing when she is not driving with AmorrAs, stole a kiss from her partner, petted her old Yorkie before heading out to one of the city\u2019s financial districts.",
      "\u201cBefore driving with AmorrAs, I had experienced violence on public transport, on the subway, and even with ride-hailing apps,\u201d she said. \u201cI once had to ride with a driver who told me and my partner that he had beaten up several women.\u201d",
      "Colmenero greeted her regular passenger, Ninfa Fuentes, with a warm hug. They chatted about their families, the book Fuentes is writing and their shared recent ADHD diagnosis.",
      "As the noise of the capital\u2019s traffic rattles the car, Fuentes peers out the window, confident that she will arrive home safe and sound.",

      "The National Citizen Observatory on Femicide says sex crimes in Mexico are the least reported due to the high level of stigma surrounding them and the lack of credibility authorities often extend to women\u2019s reports.",
      "Lawyer Norma Escobar, 32, collaborates with AmorrAs, offering legal support to women who say they have been harassed or assaulted.",
      "On more than one occasion, Escobar said she heard a forensic doctor in the gender crimes department of the Mexico state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office dismiss women filing a sexual assault complaint, telling them \u201cNothing has happened to you, there have been worse cases.\u201d",
      "Escobar, who handles harassment cases on the street and on public transportation, said that the absence of a forensic doctor has on occasions prevented women from officially filing a report.",
      "A spokesperson from Mexico state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office, when reached by The Associated Press, said they had no knowledge of the doctor's alleged comment, but when problems have been discovered the office has taken action against those involved.",
      "Experts and advocates say the history of violence against women in Mexico is rooted in deep-seated cultural machismo and systemic gender inequality, alongside a justice system riddled with problems.",
      "\u201cSeeing that the authorities downplay it, women end up often giving up on their cases,\u201d said Escobar, noting that when it comes to ensuring women's access to justice, \"there is a lack of attention, commitment and professionalism from authorities.\u201d",
      "Like many other women in Mexico, Nejoi Meddeb, 30, always traveled with her hand locked on the door handle so she could escape if needed. That is how 23-year-old Lidia Gabriela G\u00f3mez died in 2022 when she jumped out of a moving taxi in Mexico City after the driver took a different route than the one she had requested.",
      "Maria Jos\u00e9 Cabrera, a 28-year-old engineer, said she was followed by a man when she got off a minibus on her way to the train. She ran to take refuge in the subway car reserved for women only. On another occasion, in one of the city\u2019s mixed subway cars, she said a man touched her inappropriately and, by the time she reacted, he was gone.",
      "Cabrera, who now rides with AmorrAs, said she also avoided wearing skirts and never went anywhere without making sure that someone she trusts was monitoring her journey \u2014 a common internalized protocol for many women in Mexico.",
      "\u201cFor me, AmorrAs represents being able to do things I couldn\u2019t do before,\" said Cabrera. \"I really enjoy going to concerts. It shouldn\u2019t be like that but if it weren\u2019t for them, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\u201d",

      "Iraqis are preparing for a crucial parliamentary election",
      "BAGHDAD -- BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraqis are preparing to vote in a parliamentary election that comes at a crucial moment in the country and the region.",
      "The vote will begin Sunday with polling for members of the security forces and displaced people living in camps, and the general election is set for Tuesday.",
      "The outcome of the vote will influence whether Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani can serve a second term.",
      "The election comes amid fears of another war between Israel and Iran and potential Israeli or U.S. strikes on Iran-backed groups in Iraq. Baghdad seeks to maintain a delicate balance in its relations with Tehran and Washington amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration over the presence of Iran-linked armed groups.",
      "Here's a look at what to expect in the upcoming vote.",
      "This year's election will be the seventh since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that unseated the country's longtime strongman ruler, Saddam Hussein.",
      "In the security vacuum after Saddam's fall, the country fell into years of bloody civil war that saw the rise of extremist groups, including the Islamic State group. But in recent years, the violence has subsided. Rather than security, the main concern of many Iraqis now is the lack of job opportunities and lagging public services \u2014 including regular power cuts despite the country's energy wealth.",
      "Under the law, 25% of the country's 329 parliamentary seats must go to women, and nine seats are allocated for religious minorities. The position of speaker of Parliament is also assigned to a Sunni according to convention in Iraq\u2019s post-2003 power-sharing system, while the prime minister is always Shiite and the president a Kurd.",
      "Voter turnout has steadily fallen in recent elections. In the last parliamentary election in 2021, turnout was 41%, a record low in the post-Saddam era, down from 44% in the 2018 election, which at the time was an all-time low.",
      "However, only 21.4 million out of a total of 32 million eligible voters have updated their information and obtained voter cards, a decrease from the last parliamentary election in 2021, when about 24 million voters registered.",
      "Unlike past elections, there will be no polling stations outside of the country.",
      "There are 7,744 candidates competing, most of them from a range of largely sectarian-aligned parties, in addition to some independents.",
      "They include Shiite blocs led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, cleric Ammar al-Hakim, and several linked to armed groups; competing Sunni factions led by former Parliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi and current speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani; and the two main Kurdish parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.",
      "Several powerful, Iran-linked Shiite militias are participating in the election via associated political parties. They include the Kataib Hezbollah militia, with its Harakat Huqouq (Rights Movement) bloc, and the Sadiqoun Bloc led by the leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia, Qais al-Khazali.",
      "However, one of the most prominent players in the country's politics is sitting the election out.",
      "The popular Sadrist Movement, led by influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, is boycotting. Al-Sadr\u2019s bloc won the largest number of seats in the 2021 election but later withdrew after failed negotiations over forming a government, amid a standoff with rival Shiite parties. He has since boycotted the political system.",

      "Meanwhile, some reformist groups emerging from mass anti-government protests that began in October 2019 are participating but have been bogged down by internal divisions and lack of funding and political support.",
      "There have been widespread allegations of corruption and vote-buying ahead of the election, and 848 candidates were disqualified by election officials, sometimes for obscure reasons such as allegedly insulting religious rituals or members of the armed forces.",
      "Past elections in Iraq were often marred by political violence, including assassinations of candidates, attacks on polling stations and clashes between supporters of different blocs.",
      "While overall levels of violence have subsided, a candidate was also assassinated in the run-up to this year's election.",
      "On Oct. 15, Baghdad Provincial Council member Safaa al-Mashhadani, a Sunni candidate in the al-Tarmiya district north of the capital, was killed by a car bomb. Five suspects have been arrested in connection with the killing, which is being prosecuted as a terrorist act.",
      "Al-Sudani came to power in 2022 with the backing of a group of pro-Iran parties but has since sought to balance Iraq\u2019s relations with Tehran and Washington. He has positioned himself as a pragmatist focused on improving public services.",
      "While Iraq has seen relative stability during al-Sudani's first term, he does not have an easy path to a second one. Only one Iraqi prime minister, Maliki, has served more than one term since 2003.",
      "The election outcome will not necessarily indicate whether or not al-Sudani stays. In several past elections in Iraq, the bloc winning the most seats has not been able to impose its preferred candidate.",
      "On one side, al-Sudani faces disagreements with some leaders in the Shiite Coordination Framework bloc that brought him to power over control of state institutions. On the other side, he faces increasing pressure from the U.S. to control the country's militias.",
      "A matter of particular contention has been the fate of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of militias that formed to fight the Islamic State group. It was formally placed under the control of the Iraqi military in 2016 but in practice still operates with significant autonomy. Members of the PMF will be voting alongside Iraqi army soldiers and other security forces on Saturday.",

      "The nation's capital has been battered by a series of decisions by the Trump administration, from the layoffs of federal workers to the ongoing law enforcement intervention into the district. The added blow of the shutdown, which has furloughed workers and paused money for food assistance, is only deepening the economic toll.",
      "The latest figures from the D.C. Office of Revenue Analysis do not account for workforce changes since the shutdown that began Oct. 1. But even the September jobs report shows that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hovers at 6%, compared with the most recent national rate of 4.3%, and has been the highest in the nation for months.",
      "The economic woes appear to be reverberating politically. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won election Tuesday as Virginia's governor after focusing her campaign message on the effects of President Donald Trump's actions on the state\u2019s economy.",

Her husband, a government contractor, also lost his job at a museum. Since then, they have lived on savings, Medicaid and SNAP.",

      "Being falsely accused of setting fire in the Amazon with funds from Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio has become a blessing in disguise for Caetano Scannavino",
      "SAO PAULO -- Being falsely accused of setting fire in the Amazon with funds from an Oscar-winning actor eventually became a blessing in disguise for Caetano Scannavino, the founder of a nonprofit organization in the heart of the rainforest.",
      "Brazil's then President Jair Bolsonaro falsely claimed in November 2019 that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had funded nonprofit groups that he alleged were partly responsible for setting the fires. The accusation, though false, created risks for Scannavino and his work promoting sustainable development and citizens' rights in a region along the Tapajos River popular with tourists for its blend of rainforest and beaches.",
      "Four of Scannavino's friends who volunteered as forest firefighters were jailed for two days and then prosecuted as alleged perpetrators of fires in the region, only to be cleared later. Police scrolled through documents of Scannavino\u2019s Sa\u00fade e Alegria nonprofit for weeks. Scannavino received anonymous threats, and his car was set on fire.",
      "But Bolsonaro's comments helped DiCaprio take notice of Scannavino's work and decide to sponsor his work through Re:wild, a nonprofit conservation group that the actor helped found. Their partnership has already lasted five years, the Brazilian activist said.",
      "\u201cWhen the accusations emerged, DiCaprio came out to say he was not funding us, but added we deserved his support after he saw our work,\u201d Scannavino told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cI've never been with him or spoken to him. But he gives us support, uses his social media to show what this partnership does.\u201d",
      "The 59-year-old Scannavino founded Saude e Alegria, or Health and Happiness, in 1987 to promote integrated and sustainable community development in Para state, whose capital Belem will host the United Nations' Conference of the Parties, or COP30, next week. Scannavino arrived in Belem on Tuesday from Santarem, the city where the initiative is based, after a two-day boat ride that featured broadcasts with journalists, activists and climate experts.",
      "The project started as a health care initiative, but it has since grown to work with rural communities to improve their quality of life and exercise of citizenship.",
      "One project sponsored by DiCaprio's institute is the Forest Economy EcoCenter in Santarem, which serves as a hub for processing, storage and commercialization of products made by locals. Organizers said the facility enhances the economic viability of sustainable practices in the region.",
      "The hub was opened a year ago, and is also supported by the governments of Brazil, Germany and Norway, all contributors of the Amazon Fund, a Brazilian initiative that pays for anti-deforestation and sustainable development efforts.",
      "Scannavino said that the initiative cost about 5 million Brazilian reais ($938,000), mostly paid for by the Amazon Fund.",
      "\u201cThose first few days after Bolsonaro's accusation were terrible. People insulted us and our families on the streets, the firefighters had to leave. But then a surprising thing happened,\u201d Scannavino said.",
      "\u201cUsually people get away from you if such a big target appears on your back. It was the opposite with us. Eventually the accusations went away, the firefighters were released, and people were curious about us \u2014 including DiCaprio,\u201d he added.",
      "In an Instagram post this week, DiCaprio said the world leaders gathering in Brazil must ensure that those defending nature have the resources they need. He said Re:wild is pledging more money to protecting forests.",
      "\u201cI urge leaders to unite and meet the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future depends on it.\u201d",

      "The former president was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for a coup attempt in 2023 after losing his reelection bid.",
      "\u201cOur critics are specialists in hatred, and since that incident we chose to be polite, provide evidence we worked with all stakeholders, everyone who mattered in the region. We refused to leave our local communities without due health care assistance just because of an absurd accusation,\u201d Scannavino said.",
      "Many awards and acknowledgments later, Scannavino is expected to meet with Re:wild officials and perhaps DiCaprio himself at COP30.",
      "Scannavino said that he nearly met DiCaprio about 20 years ago while setting up for a photo exhibition in New York. He said that the team preparing the photo exhibition didn't recognize the actor under a cap and complained that he was getting in the way, so he left.",
      "\u201cShortly later our producer raced to tell me that was Leonardo DiCaprio,\" Scannavino said. \"I told her to run after him and get him back. She caught him on his bike a few blocks away. He thanked her, but had to leave.",
      "\"I hope that the next encounter is a very different one, so we can thank him duly,\u201d he added.",

      "World leaders, activists, experts and many more are in or headed to Brazil for this year's annual United Nations climate talks",
      "People from around the world are beginning to gather at the gateway of the Amazon in Belem, Brazil, for the 30th annual United Nations climate summit, the Conference of the Parties, known less formally as COP30.",
      "The aim is simple, but lofty: for countries to work together to stop the worst effects of human-caused climate change.",
      "That's a goal many experts say is slipping out of reach. But the stakes are high. Climate change is already escalating disasters that mean life or death for billions of people around the world, and delaying action will only worsen the problem.",
      "Here's what you need to know about COP30.",
      "With the world's largest rainforest on its doorstep, many have lauded Belem as well-positioned to highlight the role of Indigenous peoples and land stewardship in addressing climate change.",
      "Although many past COPs have primarily focused on transitioning to cleaner energy sources, research has shown that shifting food systems is also a must. Countries also need to stop destroying the ecosystems that suck up pollution and protect humans from diseases.",
      "The government of Brazil is spearheading a new initiative called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a program designed to give nations a monetary reward for protecting forests. It remains to be seen whether world leaders will pledge enough money to make the project a success.",
      "Before the conference, many would-be attendees worried about whether the city could host tens of thousands of people. Delegates have booked rooms on cruise ships in the harbor. Others are staying in by-the-hour \u201clove motels,\" and some activists said they might camp out.",
      "The weather is expected to be oppressively hot and humid, and as such the host country has already written to attendees to make the dress code a little more informal.",
      "But some experts and locals say any discomfort is a much-needed reality check, especially for those coming from rich countries. The government of Brazil was adamant that the conference needed to be in Belem to showcase what's at stake: Poorer communities are often more vulnerable to disasters worsened by climate change.",
      "Ten years ago, countries made a historic deal in the first global pact to fight climate change.",
      "Since then, the planet\u2019s annual temperature has already jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit), one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. The Paris Agreement was supposed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the historical average, but many scientists now say it's unlikely countries will stay below that threshold.",

And if countries agree to do what they've said so far, they could stave off a little over a full degree Celsius warming. That may not sound like much, but every tenth of a degree matters when it comes to the effects on catastrophic weather.",
      "This year, countries had homework: to show up with their updated national plans to fight climate change. The United States, one of the world's biggest polluters, won't be submitting theirs, having dropped out of the Paris Agreement. And many experts have criticized other countries' plans as too little to do what's needed.",
      "Unlike the Paris Agreement, or even last year when negotiators were trying to get countries to agree on how much rich countries should pay poor countries to adapt to climate change, this year's talks aren't expected to end with any ambitious new deal.",

      "For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil\u2019s environment agency.",
      "But Panama\u2019s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told The Associated Press that he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become \u201ca jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are moving to try to end the government shutdown by preparing a new bipartisan package of spending bills and daring Democrats to vote for it, but it was unclear if their plan would work.",
      "Many Democrats said they would continue to hold out for an extension of expiring health care subsidies, which was not expected to be part of the legislation.",
      "Senate Democrats, who have now voted 14 times not to reopen the government, left their second caucus meeting of the week Thursday with few answers about whether they eventually could find a compromise with Republicans \u2014 or even with each other \u2014 on how to end the shutdown.",
      "A test vote on the new package, which had not yet been publicly revealed, could come as soon as Friday. Democrats will then have a crucial choice to make: Do they keep fighting for a meaningful deal on extending health care subsidies that expire in January, while extending the pain of the shutdown? Or do they vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome?",
      "Emboldened by overwhelmingly favorable elections earlier this week, many Democrats say the fight isn\u2019t over until Republicans and President Donald Trump negotiate with them on an extension.",

      "Other Democrats have been working on a deal that would reopen the government with only an agreement for a future vote on the health care subsidies. Lawmakers in both parties were feeling increased urgency to alleviate the growing crisis at airports, pay government workers and restore delayed food aid to millions of people now that the shutdown has become the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune's decision to keep the Senate in session Friday, and perhaps over the weekend, came after Trump urged Senate Republicans at a White House breakfast Wednesday to end the shutdown. Trump said he thought the six-week impasse was a \u201cbig factor, negative\u201d for Republicans in Tuesday\u2019s elections.",
      "The bipartisan package Thune is proposing would fund parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things \u2014 and extend funding for everything else until December or January.",
      "The new package would replace the House-passed bill that the Democrats have repeatedly rejected. That legislation would only extend government funding until Nov. 21, a date that is rapidly approaching after six weeks of inaction.",
      "The details were still to be worked out, but the new legislation mirrors a tentative plan that moderate Democrats have been sketching out in hopes of finding agreement. The proposal led by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen would also take up Republicans on their offer to hold a vote on extending the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies at a later date.",

      "The unemployment rate is low and the economy is still growing, but those out of work face the slowest pace of hiring in more than a decade",
      "WASHINGTON -- When Carly Kaprive left a job in Kansas City and moved to Chicago a year ago, she figured it would take three to six months to find a new position. After all, the 32-year old project manager had never been unemployed for longer than three months.",
      "Instead, after 700 applications, she's still looking, wrapped up in a frustrating and extended job hunt that is much more difficult than when she last looked for work just a couple of years ago. With uncertainty over interest rates, tariffs, immigration, and artificial intelligence roiling much of the economy, some companies she's interviewed with have abruptly decided not to fill the job at all.",
      "\u201cI have definitely had mid-interview roles be eliminated entirely, that they are not going to move forward with even hiring anybody,\u201d she said.",
      "Kaprive is caught in a historical anomaly: The unemployment rate is low and the economy is still growing, but those out of work face the slowest pace of hiring in more than a decade. Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, calls it a \u201cjobless boom.\u201d",
      "While big corporate layoff announcements typically grab the most attention, it has been the unwillingness of many companies to add workers that has created a more painful job market than the low 4.3% unemployment rate would suggest. It is also more bifurcated: The \u201clow hire, low fire\u201d economy has meant fewer layoffs for those with jobs, while the unemployed struggle to find work.",
      "\u201cIt's like an insider-outsider thing,\u201d Guy Berger, head of research at the Burning Glass Institute said, \u201cwhere outsiders that need jobs are struggling to get their foot in, even as insiders are insulated by what up until now is a low-layoff environment.\u201d",
      "Several large companies have recently announced tens of thousands of job cuts in the past few weeks, including UPS, Target, and IBM, though Berger said it is too soon to tell whether they signal a turn for the worse in the economy. But a rise in job cuts would be particularly challenging with hiring already so low.",
      "For now, it's harder than ever to get a clear read on the job market because the government shutdown has cut off the U.S. Department of Labor's monthly employment reports. The October jobs report was scheduled for release Friday but has been delayed, like the September figures before it. The October report may be less comprehensive when it is released because not all the data may be collected.",
      "Before the shutdown, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate \u2014 the number of people hired in a given month, as a percentage of those employed \u2014 fell to 3.2% in August, matching the lowest figure outside the pandemic since March 2013.",
      "Back then, the unemployment rate was a painful 7.5%, as the economy slowly recovered from the job losses from the 2008-2009 Great Recession. That is much higher than August's 4.3%.",
      "Many of those out of work are skeptical of the current low rate. Brad Mislow, 54, has been mostly unemployed for the past three years after losing a job as an advertising executive in New York City. Now he is substitute teaching to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cIt is frustrating to hear that the unemployment rate is low, the economy is great,\" he said. \u201cI think there are people in this economy who are basically fighting every day and holding on to pieces of flotsam in the shark-filled waters or, they have no idea what it's like.\u201d",
      "With the government closed, financial markets are paying closer attention to private-sector data, but that is also mixed. On Thursday, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas unnerved investors with a report that announced job cuts surged 175% in October from a year ago.",
      "Yet on Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said that net hiring picked up in October as businesses added 42,000 jobs, after two months of declines. Still, the gain was modest. ADP's figures are based on anonymous data from the 26 million workers at its client companies.",
      "Separately, Revelio Labs, a workplace analytics company, estimated Thursday that the economy shed 9,000 jobs in October. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimates that the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% last month.",
      "Even when the government was releasing data, economists and officials at the Federal Reserve weren't sure how healthy the job market was or where it was headed next. A sharp drop in immigration and stepped-up deportations have helped keep the unemployment rate low simply by reducing the supply of workers. The economy doesn't need to create as many jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising.",

      "NEW YORK -- Former NBA player and assistant coach Damon Jones pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he profited from rigged poker games and provided sports bettors with non-public information about injuries to stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis.",
      "Jones, a onetime teammate of James, said little during back-to-back arraignments in federal court in Brooklyn, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter not guilty pleas in a pair of cases stemming from last month\u2019s federal takedown of sprawling gambling operations.",
      "Jones, 49, acknowledged he read both indictments and that he understood the charges and his bail conditions, which include his mother and stepfather putting up their Texas home as collateral for a $200,000 bond that will allow him to remain free pending trial.",
      "Jones\u2019 lawyer, Kenneth Montgomery, told a judge that they \u201cmay be engaging in plea negotiations.\u201d He is due back in court for a preliminary conference with other defendants on Nov. 24.",
      "Jones was among more than 30 people arrested in the gambling sweep. The others included reputed mobsters and prominent basketball figures, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier.",
      "Sports bettor Marves Fairley also pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges alleging he cashed in on information about injuries to NBA players, including some that prosecutors say Jones provided to him.",
      "Jones, an NBA journeyman, earned more than $20 million playing for 10 teams in 11 seasons from 1999 to 2009. He and James played together in Cleveland from 2005 to 2008 and he served as an unofficial assistant coach for James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers during the 2022-2023 season.",

      "James wasn't listed on the Lakers' injury report at the time of the text message, but the NBA's all-time scoring leader was later ruled out of the game because of a lower body jury, according to prosecutors, and the Lakers lost the game 115-106.",
      "On Jan. 15, 2024, prosecutors said, Fairley paid Jones approximately $2,500 for a tip that Davis, the Lakers' forward and center at the time, would see limited playing time against the Oklahoma City Thunder because of an injury.",
      "Fairley then placed a $100,000 bet on the Thunder to win, prosecutors said, but the tip was wrong. Davis played his usual minutes, scored 27 points and collected 15 rebounds in a 112-105 Lakers win, prompting Fairley to demand a refund of his $2,500 fee, prosecutors said.",

The move signals a vote of confidence for Lucas's efforts to stamp out diversity programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and prioritize religious rights in the workplace.",
      "First nominated to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2020 during Trump's first administration, Lucas was confirmed in July for a second five-year term. Democratic lawmakers and dozens of civil rights organizations strongly opposed Lucas\u2019 confirmation, accusing her of politicizing the agency against Congress\u2019s intent and undermining workers' civil rights. Republican senators praised her leadership, especially her commitment to rolling back Biden-era guidance on workplace gender identity protections, which Lucas has argued overstepped the EEOC\u2019s authority.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m honored to be designated Chair of the EEOC,\u201d Lucas said in an emailed statement Thursday. \u201cUnder the Trump Administration, the Commission has made significant progress advancing its core mission to uphold our nation\u2019s civil rights laws and protect American workers through consistent, effective enforcement. As Chair, I remain committed to enforcing the law evenhandedly, advancing equal opportunity, and upholding merit-based, colorblind equality in America\u2019s workplaces.\u201d",
      "Trump elevated Lucas to acting chair in January and, in an unprecedented move, fired two Democratic commissioners, clearing the way to establish a Republican majority in the agency. The Senate last month confirmed Trump pick Brittany Panuccio as a commissioner, restoring the EEOC to the full power needed to deepen his overhaul of civil rights enforcement.",
      "In a shake-up of the agency's prior focus, the EEOC under Lucas's leadership has taken on several religious discrimination cases, including a charge against Mayo Clinic alleging it refused to grant a security guard\u2019s request for a religious accommodation to a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. The hospital system did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "It has also dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers, subjected incoming complaints related to gender identity to heightened scrutiny, and stopped investigating complaints based on \u201c disparate impact liability, \u201d a concept in U.S. civil rights law designed to root out employment practices that disadvantage different demographic groups. Lucas has leveraged the agency to help the Trump administration target private institutions over their DEI programs.",

      "Tagliabue helped bring labor peace and riches to the NFL during his 17 years.",
      "NEW YORK -- Paul Tagliabue, who helped bring labor peace and riches to the NFL during his 17 years as commissioner but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure. He was 84.",
      "NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue\u2019s family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland.",
      "Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson\u2019s disease, was commissioner after Pete Rozelle from 1989 to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue.",
      "\u201cPaul was the ultimate steward of the game \u2014 tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL,\" Goodell said in a statement. \u201cI am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.\"",
      "News of Tagliabue's death came shortly before seven games kicked off Sunday. The Miami Dolphins and Minnesota Vikings held a moment of silence for Tagliabue and Marshawn Kneeland, the Dallas Cowboys' defensive tackle who died on Thursday.",
      "Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league's bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages.",
      "During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise. Los Angeles eventually regained two teams.",
      "Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the \"Rooney Rule,\" in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.",
      "When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just hired its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league.",
      "In one of his pivotal moments, Tagliabue called off NFL games the weekend after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It was one of the few times the public compared him favorably to Rozelle, who proceeded with the games the Sunday after President John Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. A key presidential aide had advised Rozelle that the NFL should play, a decision that was one of the commissioner\u2019s great regrets.",
      "Tagliabue certainly had his detractors, notably over concussions. The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma.",
      "In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn\u2019t have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions \u201cone of those pack-journalism issues\u201d and contended the number of concussions \u201cis relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously,\u201d he said on Talk of Fame Network, \u201cI do regret those remarks. Looking back, it was not sensible language to use to express my thoughts at the time. My language was intemperate, and it led to a serious misunderstanding.",
      "\u201cMy intention at the time was to make a point which could have been made fairly simply: that there was a need for better data. There was a need for more reliable information about concussions and uniformity in terms of how they were being defined in terms of severity.\u201d",
      "While concussion recognition, research and treatment lagged for much of Tagliabue\u2019s tenure, his work on the labor front was exemplary.",
      "As one of his first decisions, Tagliabue reached out to the players\u2019 union, then run by Gene Upshaw, a Hall of Fame player and former star for Al Davis\u2019 Raiders. Tagliabue had insisted he be directly involved in all labor negotiations, basically rendering useless the Management Council of club executives that had handled such duties for nearly two decades.",

      "\u201cPaul had insisted during his negotiations for the position that final control over matters such as labor and all commercial business dealings had to rest in the commissioner\u2019s office. The owners agreed and that was a large step forward toward the tremendous rebound we had as a league \u2014 an expanded league \u2014 in the \u201990s and beyond.\u201d",
      "Tagliabue forged a solid relationship with Upshaw. In breaking with the contentious dealings between the league and the NFL Players Association, Tagliabue and Upshaw kept negotiations respectful and centered on what would benefit both sides. Compromise was key, Upshaw always said \u2014 although the union often was criticized for being too accommodating.",
      "Tagliabue had been the NFL\u2019s Washington lawyer, a partner in the prestigious firm of Covington and Burling. He was chosen as commissioner in October 1989 over New Orleans general manager Jim Finks after a bitter fight highlighting the differences between the NFL\u2019s old guard and newer owners.",
      "Yet during his reign as commissioner, which ended in the spring of 2006 after pushing through a highly contested labor agreement, he managed to unite those divided owners and, in fact, relied more on the old-timers who supported him than on Jerry Jones and many of the younger owners.",
      "Tagliabue was born on Nov. 24, 1940, in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was the 6-foot-5 captain of the basketball team at Georgetown and graduated in 1962 as one of the school\u2019s leading rebounders at the time \u2014 his career average later listed just below that of Patrick Ewing. He was president of his class and a Rhodes scholar finalist. Three years later, he graduated from NYU Law School and subsequently worked as a lawyer in the Defense Department before joining Covington & Burling.",
      "He eventually took over the NFL account, establishing a close relationship with Rozelle and other NFL officials during a series of legal actions in the 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Tagliabue was reserved by nature and it sometimes led to coolness with the media, which had embraced Rozelle, an affable former public relations man. Even after he left office, Tagliabue did not measure up in that regard with Goodell, who began his NFL career in the public relations department.",
      "But after 9/11, Tagliabue showed a different side, particularly toward league employees who had lost loved ones in the attacks. He accompanied Ed Tighe, an NFL Management Council lawyer whose wife died that day, to Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, a few blocks from the NFL office.",
      "Art Shell, a Hall of Fame player, became the NFL\u2019s first modern-day Black head coach with the Raiders. He got to see Tagliabue up close and thought him utterly suited for his job.",
      "\u201cAfter my coaching career was over, I had the privilege of working directly with Paul in the league office,\u201d Shell said, \u201cHis philosophy on almost every issue was, \u2018If it\u2019s broke, fix it. And if it\u2019s not broke, fix it anyway.\u2019",
      "\u201cHe always challenged us to find better ways of doing things. Paul never lost sight of his responsibility to do what was right for the game. He was the perfect choice as NFL commissioner.\u201d",
      "Tagliabue is survived by his wife Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily.",

      "Johnson elevated his own play to back up Lateef, piling up 232 all-purpose yards along with three TDs.",
      "\u201cHe was already super, super focused, but I told him just take it one play at a time, just play football,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe first play, I was really excited. The team thought I was going to get the ball the whole game so when he pulled it and ran, I was like, \u2018OK, he\u2019s locked in.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Huskers were already bowl eligible and Lateef\u2019s cool-headed performance paired with Johnson\u2019s exploits bolstered their hopes of landing in a top-tier bowl with two games remaining in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThey got confidence in me, I got confidence in them,\u201d Lateef said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to be great.\u201d",

      "The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.",
      "Earth's warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.",
      "There's been progress \u2014 more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 \u2014 but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.",
      "\u201cI think it's important that we're honest with the world and we declare failure,\u201d said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming's harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.",
      "But diplomats aren't giving up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,\u201d said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.",
      "But the speed of humanity's climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate's harms, she said, adding that means that \"the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.\u201d",
      "U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is \u201cobviously falling behind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,\u201d she said.",
      "The planet's annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.",
      "Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia's Siberia.",
      "Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.",
      "Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan,China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.",
      "Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world's glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That's the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.",
      "Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world's seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it's enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.",
      "Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.",

      "But there's also a lot that officials celebrate in the past 10 years.",
      "Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.",
      "\u201cThere's no stopping it,\u201d said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. \u201cYou cannot hold back the tides.\u201d",
      "In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.",
      "But that's nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement's overarching goal.",
      "\u201cTen years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,\" Rockstrom said. \"Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.\u201d",
      "A report examining dozens of indicators of progress \u2014 such as solar and wind power installations \u2014 in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.",
      "The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.",
      "\u201cTechnologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,\" said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. \"But it\u2019s not nearly fast enough for what\u2019s needed.\u201d",
      "Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.",
      "Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China's going up 15.5% and India's soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.",
      "Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,\u201d said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cUnfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can\u2019t say it\u2019s failed. But then nor can you say it\u2019s dramatically succeeded.\u201d",

      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Don\u2019t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.",
      "That\u2019s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.",
      "Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can't prove that melatonin use plays any role \u2014 instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.",
      "\u201cWe should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,\u201d said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",

      "People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.",
      "The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.",
      "Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn\u2019t undergone peer review.",

      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s molecular biology program, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview. Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later.",
      "From 1988 to 1992, he directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Yet he gained unwelcome attention in 2007 when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\u201d He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \u201cpeople who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true.\u201d",
      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",
      "\u201cI only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.",

      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder.",
      "That realization was a breakthrough. It instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, and tracing family trees and ancient human ancestors. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body\u2019s blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person\u2019s offspring.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He later wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Watson never made another lab finding that big. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir and helped guide the project to map the human genome. He picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",
      "Watson died in hospice care after a brief illness, his son said Friday. His former research lab confirmed he passed away a day earlier.",
      "\u201cHe never stopped fighting for people who were suffering from disease,\u201d Duncan Watson said of his father.",
      "Watson's initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease \u2014 maybe in time to help his son.",
      "He gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\u201d He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \u201cpeople who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true.\u201d",
      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab revoked several honorary titles it had given Watson, saying his statements were \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cunsupported by science.\u201d",
      "Watson\u2019s combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \u201ca regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \u201cHis outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d",
      "Long before that, Watson scorned political correctness.",
      "\u201cA goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery.",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \u201cYou have to avoid dumb people. ... Never do anything that bores you. ... If you can\u2019t stand to be with your real peers (including scientific competitors) get out of science. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\u201d",
      "It was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson \u2014 already the holder of a Ph.D. at 23 \u2014 arrived at Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said, \u201cIt was intellectual love at first sight.\u201d",
      "Crick himself wrote that the partnership thrived in part because the two men shared \u201ca certain youthful arrogance, a ruthlessness, and an impatience with sloppy thinking.\u201d",
      "Together they sought to tackle the structure of DNA, aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked. (She died in 1958.)",
      "Watson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule\u2019s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the \u201crungs\u201d of a double helix ladder.",

      "Following the discovery, Watson spent two years at the California Institute of Technology, then joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955. Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s program for molecular biology, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview.",
      "Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later. He made the lab on Long Island an educational center for scientists and non-scientists, focused research on cancer, instilled a sense of excitement and raised huge amounts of money.",
      "He transformed the lab into a \u201cvibrant, incredibly important center,\u201d Ptashne said. It was \u201cone of the miracles of Jim: a more disheveled, less smooth, less typically ingratiating person you could hardly imagine.\u201d",
      "From 1988 to 1992, Watson directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Watson was on hand at the White House in 2000 for the announcement that the federal project had completed an important goal: a \u201cworking draft\u201d of the human genome, basically a road map to an estimated 90 percent of human genes.",
      "Researchers presented Watson with the detailed description of his own genome in 2007. It was one of the first genomes of an individual to be deciphered.",
      "Watson knew that genetic research could produce findings that make some people uncomfortable. In 2007, he wrote that when scientists identify genetic variants that predispose people to crime or significantly affect intelligence, the findings should be publicized rather than squelched out of political correctness.",
      "James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, into \u201ca family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic Party,\u201d as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn\u2019t rely on reason or science.",
      "Watson was a precocious child who loved to read, studying books like \u201cThe World Telegraph Almanac of Facts.\u201d He entered the University of Chicago on a scholarship at 15, graduated at 19 and earned his doctorate in zoology at Indiana University three years later.",
      "He got interested in genetics at age 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, if the gene is the essence of life, I want to know more about it,\u2019\u201d he later recalled. \u201cAnd that was fateful because, otherwise, I would have spent my life studying birds and no one would have heard of me.\u201d",
      "At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.",
      "\u201cSuddenly I was excited about chemistry,\u201d Watson wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d If genes could crystallize, \u201cthey must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\u201d",
      "\u201cA potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,\u201d he recalled.",
      "In the decades after his discovery, Watson\u2019s fame persisted. Apple Computer used his picture in an ad campaign. At conferences, graduate students who weren\u2019t even born when he worked at Cambridge nudged each other and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s Watson. There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",
      "His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn\u2019t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.",
      "More than a half-century after winning the Nobel, Watson put the gold medal up for auction in 2014. The winning bid, $4.7 million, set a record for a Nobel. The medal was eventually returned to Watson.",

    "story": [
      "Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist, is deeply concerned about West Virginia coal miners suffering from black lung disease",
      "OAK HILL, W.Va. -- Lisa Emery loves to talk about her \u201cboys.\u201d With each word, the respiratory therapist\u2019s face softens and shines with pride. But keep her talking, and it doesn\u2019t take long for that passion to switch to hurt. She knows the names, ages, families and the intimate stories of each one\u2019s scarred lungs. She worries about a whole community of West Virginia coal miners \u2014 including a growing number in their 30s and 40s \u2014 who come to her for help while getting sicker and sicker from what used to be considered an old-timer\u2019s disease: black lung.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cI tell them \u2026 \u2018Every single one of y\u2019all that sits down in that chair is why I feel like I was put on this earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "As director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, Emery\u2019s seen guys as young as 45 getting double lung transplants as disease rates soar among miners forced to dig through more rock filled with deadly silica to reach the remaining coal \u2014 far worse than the dust their grandfathers inhaled. A rule approved last year by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration would cut the federal limit for allowable respirable crystalline silica dust exposure by half to help protect miners of all types nationwide from the current driving force of black lung and other illnesses.",
      "But, now, it\u2019s in jeopardy amid other Trump administration cutbacks and proposals targeting workers\u2019 health and safety guardrails: Stuck in a politically charged environment that promotes industry, with lawmakers arguing to change it and the federal agency that wrote the rule not pushing to enforce it. Some angry retired miners with black lung are fighting back, demanding that President Donald Trump honor promises he made to the people who voted him in.",
      "The opposition comes months after Trump signed executive orders to allow coal-fired plants to pollute more and to streamline the permitting process and open up new areas for mineral production, including oil and natural gas drilling and mining of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d He was celebrated at the White House by smiling miners in hard hats, including some with West Virginia stickers, as he promised to put more people to work underground.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned about the coal miners: That\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, and they\u2019d be unhappy. They want to mine coal.\u201d",
      "But since his inauguration in January, a volley of firings, department eliminations and proposed regulation rollbacks have targeted hard-won health and safety protections fought for over decades to safeguard coal miners and other working-class folks.",
      "The silica rule was delayed in April after industry groups suing the government filed an emergency request in court to block it from taking effect, citing costs and difficulties implementing it. Around the same time, the Trump administration told nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that their jobs were being cut. That included those running a congressionally mandated surveillance program that certifies black lung cases.",
      "Loud public uproar and bipartisan criticism followed, and a fraction of the agency\u2019s positions were reinstated. That came only after a West Virginia coal miner diagnosed with black lung sued. A federal judge in that case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to bring back respiratory health division workers at NIOSH.",
      "But some jobs, including those focused on mine safety and research, have not been restored. And even employees who have been recalled say a lack of funding and loss of expertise in specialized positions, from chemists to engineers, have made it impossible for them to operate at the same level as before.",
      "In addition, the Labor Department has proposed altering some mining regulations to weaken the authority of district mine health and safety managers that could impact ventilation, roof prevention and training programs.",
      "The result of all these changes is that many blue-collar workers and first responders nationwide \u2014 from commercial fishermen and miners to firefighters and construction workers \u2014 will have fewer people working to help keep them safe and healthy while doing some of the country\u2019s most dangerous jobs, many of them deep in Trump country.",
      "In fact, the two reddest states in America \u2014 Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 had the highest overall worker death rates in 2023, according to the latest government figures. Together they experienced more than a dozen fatalities in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector that year.",
      "As a United Steelworkers union leader representing about 700 trona miners in Wyoming, Marshal Cummings worries the little-known white powdery rock he digs \u2014 used in everything from glass and detergents to paper \u2014 could be making workers sick. He helped push for the silica rule to cover miners like him, offering them the same free health screenings as coal miners, and was forced to wait for researchers from NIOSH to investigate air quality at his site after a request he filed was initially killed by the layoffs.",
      "\u201cWe got promised that we were going to make America great again, make America healthy again,\u201d Cummings said at the time.",
      "\u201cYou should be making these cuts with the scalpel,\u201d he added. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using a chainsaw and chunking out all these things because you\u2019re impacting workers.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, Emery sits in her office off a busy highway nestled amid West Virginia\u2019s breathtaking mountains and whitewater rivers that attract tourists from across the world. Data collected from her clinic along with more than two dozen others nationwide, spell out what she sees in real time every day: Of the 11,500 coal miners from central Appalachia with X-rays analyzed by NIOSH-certified readers from mid-2020 through mid-2025, 55% had some form of black lung with the highest annual rate \u2014 62% \u2014 recorded among miners seen in the past year, according to researcher Kirsten Almberg at the University of Illinois Chicago. That compares to 41% elsewhere in the U.S. over the same five-year period.",
      "Experts say that\u2019s because much of the easy-to-reach coal has already been extracted in West Virginia and neighboring Virginia and Kentucky, forcing miners to use massive equipment to eat through walls of quartz-filled sandstone to reach the remaining thin coal seams. This creates excess dust laced with shards of silica, which also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. It\u2019s 20 times more toxic than coal dust, the major culprit of the past that often sickened older workers. The silica crystals embed in miners\u2019 lungs, causing chronic inflammation and eventually irreversible scarring that peppers X-rays with chalky spots. It leaves proud, once-strong men skinny and weak. They choke on their food and gasp after just a few steps, cradling shiny cylinders that provide a lifeline of oxygen through tubes snaking into their nostrils.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever about drowned \u2014 or anybody\u2019s about drowned \u2014 they know what I\u2019m talking about because I go through that every morning,\u201d said Mark F. Powell, a fourth-generation miner from southern West Virginia who\u2019s upset with Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cBy the end of the day, I\u2019m so tired. Sometimes I don\u2019t even eat supper. I\u2019ll come home and sometimes I\u2019m not even able to take a shower. I\u2019m not ashamed to tell it. I\u2019ll lay on the floor and go to sleep.\u201d",
      "He said he wore his protective respirator throughout his nearly 30-year career, but was still diagnosed with a progressive form of complicated black lung and silicosis when he was 45. NIOSH certified his X-ray, allowing him to move to a job on the surface with no pay cut. Now, just four years later, he said he doesn\u2019t have the wind to mow his lawn.",
      "He said he worries about younger miners. Some, no longer protected by unions, were afraid to speak to The Associated Press or question bosses who may be skirting health and safety regulations.",
      "From 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 miners\u2019 deaths were connected to black lung, according to NIOSH. Disease rates dropped after Congress put the agency\u2019s Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program in place, but have surged since the late 1990s. NIOSH and unions have highlighted the need for the silica rule for decades, which cuts permissible silica dust levels inside mines from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an eight-hour shift \u2014 the same levels already enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in other industries such as construction. In 2018, NIOSH published a report showing around one in five coal miners with at least 25 years\u2019 experience in central Appalachia had black lung. Those findings were based largely off of working miners who may not have been sick when X-rayed. Researchers say the newer numbers collected from black lung clinics like Emery\u2019s show a bleaker picture because they capture miners who are disabled or retired, many of whom were never screened by NIOSH.",
      "In July, seven House Republicans, led by Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the House Education and Workforce committee, wrote a letter to the Mine Safety and Health Administration opposing parts of the silica rule, saying it ignored commonsense controls such as job rotation and personal protective equipment. The letter did not mention black lung or other diseases caused by silica dust, but said the rule was an example of Biden administration red tape and \u201cimposed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs\u201d on the mining industry.",
      "Walberg did not respond to questions from AP, but a committee spokesperson said in a statement that while the Republicans support ensuring miner safety, the current silica rule does not provide mine operators enough flexibility to apply the standards in an economically feasible way.",
      "The White House and the Labor Department insisted the administration can maintain miners\u2019 health and safety while rolling back regulations.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history \u2013 which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.",
      "But sick miners say the cost, for them, is their lives. Even after removing all exposure to silica and coal dust, symptoms continue to worsen, typically resulting in only two options: A risky, expensive lung transplant or death.",
      "\u201cI feel like in our part of the country \u2026 we\u2019re kinda forgotten about,\u201d said John Robinson, a former miner from Nickelsville, Virginia, who uses a walking stick and oxygen after being diagnosed with the disease 12 years ago at age 47. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Emery said her youngest patient with the most complicated form of black lung, called progressive massive fibrosis, was just 31 when he was diagnosed after only 10 years underground. And he\u2019s not alone: Rates in the region have jumped in recent years \u2014 hitting an all-time high for long-tenured miners in the mid-2000s, according to NIOSH data.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the black lung clinics is just really alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo truly, if the rule got put in place today, cutting the silica exposure level in half, you already have sick miners. It\u2019s going to take a solid 15 to 20 years for us to start to see this taper off.\u201d",
      "The history of disease and sacrifice is everywhere in these mountains. Just a few miles from Emery\u2019s office, silica created one of the worst occupational disasters in U.S. history when more than 750 miners \u2014 most of them Black \u2014 died from breathing the toxic dust while drilling the Hawks Nest tunnel in the early 1930s to divert water to power a metal plant. A small cemetery with rows of sunken, unmarked graves memorializes the tragedy in an area where rumbling coal trains and steep mining tipples remain the backdrop in tired rural towns blighted by unemployment and decaying houses.",

Megna\u2019s dad was among 78 miners who did not escape the explosion. His body remains entombed there along with 18 other men who were sealed inside.",
      "It was the first mining disaster broadcast on national television, shocking the public and enraging workers. A few months later, roughly 40,000 West Virginia coal miners walked off the job in an unauthorized wildcat strike, demanding better black lung protections and benefits when the state was a Democratic stronghold. Congress responded by passing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which required government oversight and enforcement at coal mines and established breathable dust standards \u2014 the same ones the 2024 silica rule would cut in half \u2014 and compensation for miners disabled by black lung.",
      "The federal black lung surveillance program was created as part of that act, which also helped lay the framework for broader workplace safety legislation a year later that formed OSHA and NIOSH as agencies. While OSHA is charged with enforcing worker health and safety standards under the Department of Labor, including citing employers for violations, NIOSH is the quiet research and development arm. It focuses on making recommendations to avoid work-related illness and injury and is overseen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "NIOSH investigates and studies firefighter deaths, including cancers. It certifies N95 masks and reviews and verifies illnesses involving 9/11 first responders who could be eligible for benefits under the federal World Trade Center Health Program. Scientists in its Spokane, Washington, laboratory \u2014 which remains gutted \u2014 work to keep wildland firefighters, oil and gas workers and commercial fishermen safe. Some were also helping to develop real-time monitors to alert miners of silica dust overexposure.",
      "The chaotic layoffs in April and May were made in the name of redundancy when Elon Musk was at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, but no other agency does what NIOSH does. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., admitted during a congressional budget hearing in May that \u201cwe made a couple of mistakes\u201d while saying he restored 328 jobs at NIOSH, mostly in Cincinnati and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "\u201cUnder Secretary Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\u201d a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services like those that support coal miners through NIOSH.\u201d",
      "Unions estimate around 500 employees remain on administrative leave while their future is hashed out in court after lawsuits were filed to have the jobs reinstated. Others took buyouts or have accepted positions elsewhere. The Trump administration has attacked federal employee unions, including those representing the agency, attempting to strip collective bargaining rights. That too has prompted lawsuits.",
      "NIOSH was slated to become part of the newly planned Administration for a Healthy America, and Kennedy proposed its budget for fiscal year 2026 be slashed to $73 million \u2014 an 80% decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, in September, the Trump administration provided $625 million in funding to expand and improve coal-powered plants.",
      "Prior to the government shutdown, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended the agency\u2019s funding either be slightly reduced or maintained near pre-Trump levels. Experts have argued NIOSH is a bargain, costing about $2.20 per working American annually. In 2023, the nonprofit National Safety Council found workplace injuries alone amount to about $177 billion each year.",
      "\u201cWe like to say that NIOSH is the little agency that no one\u2019s heard of that\u2019s probably helped save your life,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, an industrial hygienist at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati offices, who spoke as vice president of the AFGE Local 3840 union. \u201cEvery single workplace safety and health regulation is written in blood.\u201d",
      "The fight has not died for some aging former West Virginia coal miners with black lung who meet regularly in a building adjacent to Emery\u2019s clinic in Oak Hill. Last month, dozens of them drove hours along with counterparts from elsewhere in Appalachia to protest on the steps of the shuttered Labor Department, some pushing walkers and stopping to catch their breath every few steps. They held up photographs of dead friends and loved ones with signs reading \u201cCoal Miners Lives Matter.\u201d",
      "On the opposite side of the building, an enormous banner with Trump\u2019s face read: \u201cAmerican Workers First.\u201d",
      "Former miner and coal truck driver Randy Lawrence said both Trump and Kennedy should do an eight-hour shift underground to see why NIOSH and the silica rule are essential. He said he hopes to send a loud message to the president he voted for, but no longer supports.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to hurt the working man,\u201d he said, lugging his oxygen tank. \u201cThey ain\u2019t worried about the miners or people in West Virginia or coal miners anywhere. All they\u2019re worried about is the almighty dollar in D.C. They don\u2019t care about the little people that put them there.\u201d",
      "Outgoing United Mine Workers of America union president Cecil Roberts went a step further, accusing those delaying the silica rule of holding a pillow over miners\u2019 faces, suffocating workers. The UMWA has tried to intervene in the silica rule lawsuit to help push for its enforcement, but government lawyers have opposed it.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the killing in Appalachia!\u201d he yelled into the crowd. \u201cThis country owes coal miners so much. \u2026 We allowed those fat-ass people up on Wall Street to be millionaires and billionaires. It\u2019s our turn!\u201d",
      "The silica rule lawsuit is backed by a number of industry groups that represent different types of mining nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman at the National Mining Association, which is part of the lawsuit. She said the problem is instead with how the new rule is regulated.",
      "Industry wants it to match more closely with OSHA\u2019s methods of compliance, including allowing personal protective equipment to be used more to help meet the standards. But the mining rule calls for company ventilation systems and dust suppression devices to be used as part of the primary means of control.",
      "Miners say respirators clog up frequently, making it hard to breathe, and they often slip or don\u2019t seal properly due to beards, sweat or coal dust. They can also make it difficult for them to hear, see or talk in the noisy environment underground.",
      "Retired miners who attended the rally say they also are pushing to make sure the Mine Safety and Health Administration isn\u2019t weakened. Wayne Palmer was recently confirmed to lead the agency, which has seen a dwindling number of inspectors. Palmer previously worked as an executive for an industrial minerals trade association that filed a legal brief opposing the silica rule. Protest organizers say they asked to meet with Palmer, but never got a reply. The Labor Department did not respond to specific questions about the silica rule or whether Palmer planned to address the group.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a fox in a chicken house,\u201d said Gary Hairston, 71, president of the National Black Lung Association, who came out of the mines in southern West Virginia sick at 48 years old. He said coal companies cannot be trusted to police themselves, adding he used to put tape over his air monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t get bad samples because he feared being fired. He said the company also alerted miners when inspectors arrived to make sure all the safety violations were hidden. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got nobody to go to.\u201d",
      "The Mine Safety and Health Administration houses inspectors who would be responsible for enforcing the silica rule, which the agency agreed to pause in April, citing restructuring at NIOSH and technical issues. This administration did not push back against the industry lawsuit in federal appeals court and was granted another delay in October, due to the government shutdown. The Labor Department has also proposed changes that would limit district managers\u2019 authority to force mines to comply with ventilation, roofing and training regulations to carry out Trump\u2019s directive to eliminate bureaucracy.",
      "But at Emery\u2019s black lung clinic in southern West Virginia, far from the lawsuits and the policy changes, all she can think about is one gasping miner arriving after another. Many are still working with limited lung capacity just to keep their health insurance, and they come to her with questions, hoping she can help delay the inevitable. She sees the young ones struggling to throw a football in the yard or make it to school sporting events.",
      "\u201cThese families, you know, they\u2019re my families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s miners whose kids go to school with my kids.\u201d",
      "The worst ones have the number to her cellphone, which is never turned off. Sometimes they call in a panic, desperate for help.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines with even more missing and then hit Vietnam Friday. A second typhoon, Fong-Wong, is forecast to hit the Philippines around Sunday and strengthen to a major storm by that time.",
      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",
      "That MJO is now around the international dateline about a week-and-a-half to two weeks away from the Atlantic, where it could help spawn late season tropical storms, she said.",
      "The lists are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization; the names are ones that are familiar in each region. Names are taken off the list and replaced to avoid confusion if a hurricane causes a lot of damage or deaths. For example, Katrina was retired after it devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Philippines has its own naming system, so Typhoon Kalmaegi is also being called Tino.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As the saying went, all roads once led to Rome \u2014 and those roads stretched 50% longer than previously known, according to a new digital atlas published Thursday.",
      "The last major atlas of ancient Roman road networks was published 25 years ago. Since then, advances in technology and other newly accessible sources have greatly expanded researchers\u2019 ability to locate ancient roadways.",
      "Over five years, a team of archaeologists combed through historical records, ancient journals, locations of milestones and other archival data. Scientists then looked for clues in satellite imagery and aerial photography, including recently digitized photos taken from planes during World War II.",
      "When ancient accounts hinted at lost roads in a certain area, researchers analyzed the terrain from above to spot subtle traces \u2014 things like faint differences in vegetation, soil variations or shifts in elevation, as well as traces of ancient engineering like raised mounds or cut hillsides \u2014 that revealed where Roman lanes once ran.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a massive game of connecting the dots on a continental scale,\u201d said Tom Brughmans, an archaeologist and co-author of the study published in Scientific Data.",
      "The data and an interactive digital map are also available online for scholars, history teachers or anyone with an interest in ancient Roman history.",
      "Earlier research had focused on \u201cthe highways of the Roman Empire\u201d \u2014 the large thoroughfares most often mentioned in familiar historical accounts, said Brughmans.",
      "The updated map fills in more obscure details about \u201csecondary roads, like the country lanes, that connected villas and farms\u201d and other locations, said Brughmans, who's based at Aarhus University in Denmark.",
      "Researchers previously tallied the extent of Roman roads as covering around 117,163 miles (188,555 kilometers). The new work shows nearly 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) of roads across the extent of the Roman Empire, allowing travel from Spain to Syria.",
      "The study added a lot to archaeologists' knowledge of ancient roads in North Africa, the plains of France and in the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece.",
      "\u201cThis will be a very foundational work for a lot of other research,\u201d said archaeologist Benjamin Ducke of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin, who was not involved in the project.",

      "But one caveat, he said, is that it\u2019s still not clear if all the roads were ever open and active at the same time.",
      "Being able to visualize the ancient routes that Roman farmers, soldiers, diplomats and other travelers took will provide a better understanding of key historical trends that depended on the movement of people during Roman times, said Brughmans, including the rise of Christianity across the region and the spread of ancient outbreaks.",
      "\u201cThe Romans left a huge impact with this road network,\u201d which created the blueprint for many roads still in use today, said study co-author and archaeologist Adam Pa\u017eout of the Autonomous University of Barcelona.",

But during that time, they also funded underprivileged schools, immigration reform and efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Now, the billionaire couple is shifting the bulk of their philanthropic resources to Biohub, the pair's science organization, and focusing on using artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery. The idea is to develop virtual, AI-based cell models to understand how they work in the human body, study inflammation and use AI to \u201charness the immune system\u201d for disease detection, prevention and treatment.",
      "\u201cI feel like the science work that we\u2019ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done. So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,\u201d Zuckerberg said Wednesday evening at an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City, California. Three other Biohub institutes \u2014 in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, focus on addressing different scientific challenges.",
      "Chan and Zuckerberg have pledged 99% of their lifetime wealth \u2014 from shares of Meta Platforms, where Zuckerberg is CEO \u2014 toward these efforts. Since 2016, when Biohub launched, they have donated $4 billion to basic science research, a figure that does not include operating expenses for running a large-scale computer cluster for life science research. The organization says it is now on track to double that amount over the next decade, with an operating budget of about $1 billion a year.",
      "Last week, singer Billie Eilish told an audience that included Chan and Zuckerberg that rich people should do more to address the world\u2019s problems.",

      "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s charitable organization, has been faced with criticism recently for curtailing its other philanthropic work. Earlier this year, it stopped funding grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion, immigration advocacy and other issues currently in the crosshairs of the Trump administration \u2014 though the focus has been shifting to science and away from social issues for years, the couple says, long before the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cSo we basically looked at the ecosystem of science funding and decided that the place that we can make the biggest impact was on tool development,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd specifically working on long-term projects, 10 to 15 years, where the output of them was taking on a biological challenge that would produce a tool that scientists everywhere could use to accelerate the pace of science.\u201d",
      "The organization earlier this year scrubbed its website's mentions of DEI, including a statement saying \u201cPeople of color and marginalized communities have experienced a long history of exploitation in the name of scientific research, and indeed science has itself been deployed as a tool of oppression.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoing forward, Biohub will be our primary philanthropic effort and where we\u2019ll dedicate the vast majority of our resources,\u201d Zuckerberg and Chan said in a blog post Thursday. \u201cWe will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives.\u201d",

As it is open source \u2014 free and publicly available \u2014 scientists can then conduct virtual experiments on a scale not possible in physical laboratories.",

We have cured diseases for mice and for flies and for zebrafish, many, many times. And that\u2019s great. But we want to make sure that we are actually using biology to push the forefront of medicine for people \u2014 and that is so promising.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones",
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones, following a spate of incursions into NATO airspace in recent months that exposed the alliance\u2019s vulnerabilities and put Europe on edge.",
      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",
      "A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war, as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of expensive missiles.",

      "U.S. military leaders in Europe are also advocating for the creation of an Eastern Flank Deterrence Line, a layered zone of defenses along NATO\u2019s border.",

Chris Donahue said in July that he wants to create a network of sensors and a command-and-control system that will work with almost any hardware available \u2014 allowing systems to be swapped in and out as they are updated or become obsolete.",
      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",
      "The Merops system has been chosen because it has been used successfully in Ukraine. If something doesn\u2019t work there, it\u2019s \u201cprobably not worthwhile acquiring,\u201d Lowin said.",
      "Drones are evolving rapidly, and each new type demands a different response: The challenge is to identify the threat and then almost immediately work out how to attack it, said Brig. Gen. Zacarias Hernandez, deputy chief of staff plans at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "That requires extremely fast production cycles \u2014 from development to battlefield within weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia is also mass-producing attack drones, equipping them with cameras, jet-propelled engines and advanced anti-jamming antennae.",

      "Ukraine, NATO and Russia are in a game of technological cat-and-mouse, the NATO officials suggested.",

      "\u201cIt overwhelmed me so much,\u201d Watson recalled. \u201cI just started bursting out in tears, because suddenly, I was there naked.\u201d",
      "In the four years since her experience, deepfakes \u2014 highly realistic artificial intelligence-generated images, videos or audio of real people or events \u2014 have become not only easier to make worldwide but also look or sound exponentially more realistic. That's thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative AI tools, including video generation tools from OpenAI and Google.",
      "These tools give millions of users the ability to easily spit out content, including for nefarious purposes that range from depicting celebrities Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to disrupting elections and humiliating teens and women.",
      "In response, Denmark is seeking to protect ordinary Danes, as well as performers and artists who might have their appearance or voice imitated and shared without their permission.

      "If enacted, Danish citizens would get the copyright over their own likeness. In theory, they then would be able to demand that online platforms take down content shared without their permission. The law would still allow for parodies and satire, though it\u2019s unclear how that will be determined.",
      "Experts and officials say the Danish legislation would be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes.",
      "Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI, said that he applauds the Danish government for recognizing that the law needs to change.",
      "\u201cBecause right now, when people say \u2018what can I do to protect myself from being deepfaked?\u2019 the answer I have to give most of the time is: \u2018There isn\u2019t a huge amount you can do,\u2019\" he said, \u201dwithout me basically saying, \u2018scrub yourself from the internet entirely.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t really possible.\"",

      "The law would apply only in Denmark, and is unlikely to involve fines or imprisonment for social media users. But big tech platforms that fail to remove deepfakes could face severe fines, Engel-Schmidt said.",

      "An Indian air force transport plane left Thailand en route to India and another plane was to leave later in the day, with about 270 out of 465 Indians who are to be repatriated. The remainder will leave Thailand next Monday, according to Maj. Gen. Maitree Chupreecha, commander of the Thai army\u2019s northern region Naresuan Task Force.",
      "In March, India repatriated 549 nationals after an earlier crackdown on cybercrime operations at the Myanmar-Thai border.",
      "Those currently being repatriated are among more than 1,500 people from 28 nations who fled the raid in Myawaddy. Across the border in the Thai town of Mae Sot, Thai authorities had set up temporary facilities for housing and processing not just Indians, but also Chinese, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Ethiopians and Kenyans, among other nationalities.",
      "In April, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under $40 billion in annual profits.",

      "Experts say Americans are looking for a generational change.",
      "Zohran Mamdani's historic election has sparked a lot of conversation about a changing of the guard not only for New York City, but also the entire country, as some experts told ABC News his victory could be a turning point for younger millennials and Generation Z political candidates.",
      "Mamdani, a two-term state assemblyman who recently turned 34, campaigned with a progressive message that voters wanted a change from the status quo and that someone like him was attuned to the younger generation's most pressing issues, such as high housing costs.",
      "Grace Smoker, vice president of media strategy at Stu Loeser & Co, a New York- based political media consulting group, told ABC News that the mayor-elect will likely not be the only candidate under 35 who will be making waves in future elections.",
      "\"It's absolutely a nationwide movement,\" Smoker said.",
      "The political reaction to Mamdani's win has already been large, according to a group that is working to increase millennial and Gen Z representation in elected offices.",
      "Run for Something,\u00a0an organization that recruits and supports progressive candidates under 40 to run for local and state offices, saw 10,000 people sign up for its services in the two weeks following Mamdani's June Democratic primary win. It has had 2,000 people sign up since Tuesday, according to its co-founder and president, Amanda Litman.",
      "\"My expectations are that we will see those numbers grow as they see they can win,\" Litman told ABC News, referring to younger political candidates.",
      "Experts say this surge won't just be seen among Democrats, as millennial and Gen Z Republicans are also seeing an emergence and seeking an endorsement from the president.",
      "\"We are already seeing evidence of senior members of Congress facing challenges from younger members, and they're being backed by the voters,\" Jonathan Hanson, a political scientist and lecturer in statistics at the University of Michigan, told ABC News. \"They're saying it's time for a fresh face.\"",
      "Smoker, who did not work on Mamdani's campaign, said the state assemblyman and other successful candidates under 35 have taken advantage of this sentiment to successfully sell themselves and their ideas.",
      "Smoker said those candidates grew up with the internet and social media and they've been tapping into online platforms to effectively sell their campaigns in ways that their older counterparts can't replicate.",
      "She noted one of Mamdani's early campaign social media posts where he filmed himself casually talking to New Yorkers who voted for Trump last year and asked what their motivation was. That video not only helped sell Mamdani's focus on affordability but also introduced him to the young voting bloc that helped strengthen his campaign.",
      "Mamdani also bolstered his online presence with street-level campaigning, going from neighborhood to neighborhood and inviting New Yorkers to join in as he made his pitch and listened to the communities, Smoker said.",
      "\"It's not about doing a TikTok, it is really about understanding when you are being cringe,\" she said. \"I think that is the biggest factor we're seeing in these successful campaigns. They know how to communicate and listen.\"",
      "Hanson said the high polarization and dissatisfaction with the current state of politics have led to increasing acceptance of younger candidates by older voters.",
      "\"People are frustrated with things that are happening, and they're going to mobilize. Along with that will come candidates who will want to ride the wave,\" he said.",

      "But it's not just left-leaning candidates who are riding the wave.",
      "Hanson noted that the GOP, particularly the MAGA wing, has been successful in recruiting younger men to its cause over the last few years, and that demographic leaned toward Trump last year, according to the polls.",

      "Hanson cited the large rallies hosted by Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA as examples of this movement.",
      "\"There are younger faces, but it's been harder for candidates to distinguish themselves outside of the movement,\" he said. \"I think that there is a similar desire to get involved and be part of this vision with America that is more consistent with what Trump aspires to.\"",
      "Hanson added that typically the minority party in power sees the most retirements, and there will likely be less of a changing of the guard in 2026 for the GOP.",

      "Zohran Mamdani is set to become the city's first Muslim mayor.",
      "After New York City chose Zohran Mamdani to become the city's 111th mayor, exit polls revealed that the mayor-elect captured the majority of votes from both the younger population and newcomers to the city.",
      "Some experts said Mamdani's success with these voters resulted from his campaign's messaging about challenging the status quo.",
      "\"He awakened something in them. That goes for the new voters and young voters, where they thought that they had to accept the status quo of politics as usual and things that are coming out of Washington, D.C., and the corruption that we've had, and they realize that they actually don't have to look that way,\" Christina Greer, an associate political science professor at Fordham University, told ABC News.",
      "Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, captured 78% of voters under 30 and 66% of those voters 30 to 44 in Tuesday's election, according to ABC News exit polls, conducted by SSRS. Among voters 45 to 64, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo edged out Mamdani, 53% to 47%. A majority of voters 65 and older (55%) voted for Cuomo while 36% voted for Mamdani. Additionally, newcomers to the city were some of the most likely voters in the state to vote for Mamdani, with 81% of those who have lived in New York City less than 10 years supporting him, the exit polls found.",
      "Along with his electoral success among younger and newer New Yorkers, Mamdani also earned support from 55% of voters who lived in the city for over 10 years, but were not born in the city. More of those who were born in New York City voted for Cuomo (49%) than Mamdani (38%), according to the exit polls.",
      "More first-time New York City mayoral voters also voted for Mamdani than those who have previously voted for mayor in the city, 66% versus 47%, the exit polls found.",
      "Greer said this accomplishment in gathering the majority of the youth's vote was through Mamdani's engagement in social media, along with the campaign's clear message about working as a community.",
      "\"This campaign, which was incredibly run, was clear and consistent that it's not just about beating someone else -- meaning the Republican Party or Donald Trump or Andrew Cuomo -- it was about an additive type of politics, where if we work together, we can collectively get more. I think that message resonated with a lot of people,\" Greer said.",
      "Additionally, Mamdani's focus on the affordability of New Yorkers -- specifically his plans to freeze rent for rent-stabilized apartments and provide universal child care and free buses -- \"resonated\" with younger generations, according to Jessica Siles, the senior director of communications for advocacy organization Voters of Tomorrow.",
      "\"I think New York has some specific affordability issues that maybe aren't everywhere in the country. When you are moving to New York, there are certain financial hurdles in some ways that make things difficult. So fresh faces absolutely are looking for some relief and leadership that is able to at least have them feel like they're better equipped to navigate them,\" Siles told ABC News.",
      "Asked to comment on Mamdani securing the votes of younger people and newcomers to the city, a spokesperson for Cuomo's campaign said, \"it's more than that.\"",
      "\"This needs to be a city for everyone and the fact that nearly half of New Yorkers from across the spectrum united against what the democratic nominee in an overwhelmingly democratic city campaigned on shouldn't be overlooked,\" Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement to ABC News. \"We're proud of the campaign Andrew Cuomo ran in the general, a record 42% on an independent ballot line buried on the ballot.\"",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s a trusted politician in some ways because he had a 40-year head start over Mamdani. His father was a governor in the 90s. Older New Yorkers and New Yorkers who have been in the city for several decades or generations know that Cuomo is a known Democratic quantity,\" Greer said.",
      "Despite Cuomo's favorability with native New Yorkers, Mamdani's ability to meet with voters across the city -- whether they are waiting in a taxi cab line or on the subway -- allowed for everyone in the city, including those who are new to the area, to quickly become familiar with his vision, Greer said.",
      "\"Whether it's a church or a club, he was there. He's on the subway. If you say you want to be mayor of New York, he's actually in lots of different places where people are,\" Greer said. \"It's reminiscent of Obama days -- at a certain point in time, it's not about the candidate, it's about the movement.\"",
      "Regardless of where Mamdani was engaging with New Yorkers, Siles said he was better able to build a community and \"coalition of support of all ages,\" creating avenues for people -- including fresh faces in the city -- to connect.",

      "\u201cIf New Yorkers see that he is working for them, they are more likely to give him some sort of grace as he tries to deliver on behalf of the people. They want to see people fighting for them. Some of that will be just the sheer ambition of not just the agenda, but the aggression of the new mayor in trying to deliver on behalf of millions of New Yorkers,\" Greer told ABC News.",

      "U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,500 weekend flights by Saturday evening as the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s mandate to reduce air traffic because of the government shutdown showed no signs of easing.",
      "The slowdown at many of the nation\u2019s busiest airports did not cause immediate widespread disruptions. But it deepened the impact felt by the nation\u2019s longest federal shutdown.",
      "\u201cWe all travel. We all have somewhere to be,\u201d said Emmy Holguin, 36, who was flying from Miami to see family in the Dominican Republic. \u201cI'm hoping that the government can take care of this.\u201d",

      "Airports in Atlanta and Chicago, as well as Charlotte, North Carolina, and Newark, New Jersey, saw numerous disruptions throughout the day. Ongoing staffing shortages in radar centers and control towers added to the cancellations and delays at several East Coast airports, including those around New York City.",
      "Not all the cancellations were due to the FAA order, and those numbers represented just a small portion of the overall flights nationwide. But they are certain to rise in the coming days if the slowdown continues.",
      "The FAA said the reductions impacting all commercial airlines started at 4% of flights at 40 targeted airports and will be bumped up again Tuesday before hitting 10% on Friday.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that even more cuts might be needed if the shutdown continues and more air traffic controllers are off the job.",

      "Atkins, now 86, was a news reporter in Detroit when he was sent to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to write about the Fitzgerald. The freighter was transporting iron ore from Wisconsin to Zug Island in Detroit when it encountered a terrifying storm. All 29 men aboard died, and the exact cause of the wreck remains a mystery.",
      "The Fitzgerald was the last major shipwreck on the Great Lakes, thanks to technology improvements in the years after the disaster. The wreck also became the most famous of the region thanks to Gordon Lightfoot's eerie folk ballad that has kept it in public memory.",

      "Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war have spilled into K-12 schools around the U.S., with advocates reporting a rise in antisemitism since the 2023 surprise attack on Israel",
      "In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas two years ago, high school teacher Josh Hirsch posted comments on social media in support of Israel. It was unrealistic for Hamas to expect a ceasefire, he wrote, as long as they were holding hostages.",
      "Soon afterward, a former student called for his firing. A note taped outside the door of his Adams County, Colorado, classroom contained his wife\u2019s name and their home address. And a sticker that appeared on his chair read: \u201cIsrael is committing genocide in Gaza.\u201d",
      "The reaction startled Hirsch, the only Jewish teacher in his school building. For the first time in his 14-year career, he considered quitting. He stayed and joined an educators' advocacy network created by the Anti-Defamation League, a way he saw to make schools more inclusive of diverse viewpoints.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been a teacher and tried to keep my focus on being the best teacher I could,\u201d he said.",
      "Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war have spilled into schools around the U.S., with advocates reporting a rise in antisemitic harassment since the 2023 surprise attack on Israel. While some argue school leaders have failed to take the threat seriously, others warn criticism of Israel and the military campaign in Gaza are interpreted too often as hate speech.",
      "The Trump administration has not punished school systems the way it has hit colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism, but schools are still facing pressure to respond more aggressively. Several states have pressed for new vigilance, including legislation that critics say would stifle free speech.",
      "Lawmakers in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee have passed measures to increase school accountability for complaints of antisemitism, and a law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will provide training to identify and prevent antisemitism in schools. In Arizona, the Democratic governor vetoed a bill on how to deal with reports of antisemitism in schools, calling it an attack on educators.",
      "Many of the measures, including one signed by Oklahoma\u2019s Republican governor, call for adoption of a definition of antisemitism that casts certain criticism of Israel as hate speech.",
      "\u201cThese bills make it clear that Oklahoma stands with our Jewish communities and will not tolerate hatred disguised as political discourse,\" said Kristen Thompson, a Republican state senator in Oklahoma who authored the legislation.",
      "Dozens of states have adopted the definition promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is also recognized by the U.S. State Department. It lists 11 examples of antisemitic conduct, such as applying \u201cdouble standards\u201d to Israel or comparing the country\u2019s policies to Nazism.",
      "While supporters of this definition of antisemitism say it is necessary to combat evolving forms of Jewish hate, civil liberties groups warn it suppresses pro-Palestinian speech.",
      "The Trump administration has leveraged antisemitism investigations in its efforts to reshape higher education, suspending billions of dollars in federal funding to Harvard, Columbia and other universities over allegations they tolerated hate speech, especially during protests over the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The White House has not gotten as involved at the K-12 level. At congressional hearings, House Republicans have taken some large school systems to task over their handling of antisemitism, but the administration largely has left it to the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to address complaints.",
      "In one of the cases under investigation, a complaint described students at the Berkeley Unified School District in California asking Jewish classmates what \u201ctheir number is,\u201d referring to numbers tattooed on Jews during the Holocaust. It also said teachers made antisemitic comments and led walkouts that praised Hamas.",
      "The district did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In another California case, the family of a 14-year-old girl filed a federal lawsuit last year alleging she had to leave University Preparatory Academy, a charter school in San Jose, in 2023 because of antisemitic bullying. After the Hamas attack, she said students called her names, including \u201cterrorist.\u201d The California Department of Education and the school said they could not comment on pending litigation.",

The number was down from over 1,100 recorded in 2023, but well above numbers in prior years, according to the ADL.",
      "A Massachusetts state commission formed last year to combat antisemitism found it was a \u201cpervasive and escalating problem\u201d in schools.",
      "At one meeting, a commission co-chair, Democratic state Rep. Simon Cataldo, said the Massachusetts Teachers Association was sharing antisemitic resources with teachers, including a kindergarten workbook that describes Zionists as \u201cbullies\u201d and an image of a Star of David made of dollar bills. The union said those were singled out among hundreds of images in art and posters about Palestinians, and links to those materials were removed.",
      "The union said it has engaged in efforts to confront increases in both antisemitism and Islamophobia and accused the commission of \u201coffensive political theater.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who manipulate antisemitism to achieve political objectives \u2014 such as undermining labor unions and public educators \u2014 are following the lead of the Trump administration,\u201d the union said in a statement.",
      "Margaret Litvin, an associate professor of Arabic and comparative literature at Boston University, said the commission was \u201cdeliberately conflating criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jews and bias against Jews.\" That approach will be used to justify \u201cheavy-handed\u201d interference by the state in school district affairs, said Litvin, co-founder of the Boston-area Concerned Jewish Faculty and Staff group.",
      "The tension reached the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union, which this summer weighed a proposal to drop ADL classroom materials that educators use to teach about the Holocaust and bias. Backers said the ADL had an outsize influence on school curricula and policy, with an underlying pro-Israel viewpoint.",
      "Delegates at the union\u2019s representative assembly narrowly voted to approve the proposal, but they were overruled by the NEA board of directors. Union President Becky Pringle said the proposal \u201cwould not further NEA\u2019s commitment to academic freedom, our membership, or our goals.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath, the ADL invited K-12 educators to join a new network called BEACON: Building Educator Allies for Change, Openness, and Networks, which it said is intended to help educators learn from each other how to address and combat antisemitism and other forms of hate.",
      "Hirsch, the teacher in Colorado, was among hundreds who expressed interest.",
      "Some of the blowback he faced stemmed from his online commentary about local activist organizations. After donating money to Black Lives Matter groups and supporting them with a sign in his yard, he expressed feelings of betrayal to see the groups expressing support for Palestinians and not Israel.",
      "He said he was surprised by the reaction to the posts in his predominantly Hispanic school community. A former debate coach, he aims through his work with the ADL network to help students share their opinions in constructive ways.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re giving them the opportunity to hate and we\u2019re giving them the opportunity to make enemies of someone, it really is counterproductive to what we\u2019re trying to do as a society,\u201d he said.",

      "The government shutdown has stretched into its 40th day",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown stretched into its 40th day Sunday even as senators stayed in Washington for a grueling weekend session hoping to find an end to the funding fight that has disrupted flights nationwide, threatened food assistance for millions of Americans and left federal workers without pay.",
      "The Senate has so far shown few signs of progress over a weekend that could be crucial for the shutdown fight. Republican leaders are hoping to hold votes on a new package of bills that would reopen the government into January while also approving full-year funding for several parts of government. But the necessary Democratic support for that effort was far from guaranteed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only a handful of votes away\u201d from passing a bill to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Saturday.",
      "Still, Democratic leaders are pushing hard for an extension of subsidies for health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have rejected that offer, but signaled openness to an emerging proposal from a small group of moderate Democrats to end the shutdown in exchange for a later vote on the \u201cObamacare\u201d subsidies, which make coverage more affordable.",
      "For those enrolled in Affordable Care Act exchanges, premiums on average are expected to more than double next year if Congress allows the enhanced subsidies to lapse.",
      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said the pledge to hold a vote on extending the health care subsidies would be a \u201cwasteful gesture\u201d unless \u201cyou have the commitment of the speaker of the House that he will support it and that the president of the United States will sign it.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has made clear he is unlikely to compromise any time soon. He pressed Republicans again over the weekend to get rid of the Senate's filibuster rules that prevent the chamber from advancing on most legislation unless there is support from 60 senators.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and others, negotiating among themselves and with some rank-and-file Republicans, have been discussing bills that would pay for parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things \u2014 and extend funding for everything else until December or January. The agreement would only come with the promise of a future health care vote, rather than a guarantee of extended subsidies.",
      "It was unclear whether enough Democrats would support such a plan. Even with a deal, Trump appears unlikely to support an extension of the health benefits. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also said this past week that he would not commit to a health vote.",
      "Republican leaders only need five additional votes to fund the government, and the group involved in the talks has ranged from 10 to 12 Democratic senators.",
      "Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. They lined up Saturday to take to the Senate floor and argue that subsidies for the plans should be routed through individuals.",

      "Trump wants Republicans to end the shutdown quickly and scrap the filibuster, which requires 60 Senate votes for most legislation, so they can bypass Democrats altogether. Vice President JD Vance, a former Ohio senator, endorsed the idea in an online post Saturday, saying Republicans who want to keep the filibuster are \u201cwrong.\u201d",
      "Republicans have rejected Trump\u2019s call, and Thune is eyeing a bipartisan package that mirrors the proposal the moderate Democrats have been sketching out. What Thune, who has refused to negotiate, might promise on health care is unknown.",
      "The package would replace the House-passed legislation that the Democrats have rejected 14 times since the shutdown began Oct. 1. The current bill would only extend government funding until Nov. 21.",
      "A test vote on new legislation could come in the next few days if Thune decides to move forward.",
      "Then Democrats would have a crucial choice: Keep fighting for a meaningful deal on extending the subsidies that expire in January, while prolonging the pain of the shutdown? Or vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome.",
      "Schumer on Saturday persisted in arguing that Republicans should accept a one-year extension of the subsidies before negotiating the future of the tax credits.",
      "\u201cDoing nothing is derelict because people will go bankrupt, people will lose insurance, people will get sicker,\u201d Schumer said in a floor speech. \u201cThat\u2019s what will happen if this Congress fails to act.\u201d",

      "U.S. college students who receive federal food aid are looking to their campuses for support because the program known as SNAP is in limbo during the government shutdown",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Acorn squash, Spam and baby food lined the shelves on a recent day at a college food pantry in California's capital city, a resource that students receiving federal aid to purchase groceries may have to increasingly rely on because that assistance has been in limbo during the government shutdown.",
      "Hundreds of students at California State University, Sacramento, or Sac State, visit the school's Basic Needs Resource Center every week, where they can select up to a dozen items per trip \u2014 ranging from fresh produce and meat to toiletries and secondhand clothes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big blessing,\u201d said Antonette Duff, a junior studying psychology at the university who\u2019s enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "More than 3,600 students at the college of roughly 31,000 receive aid through SNAP, said Emily Tupper, the college\u2019s director of Crisis Assistance and Resource Education Support. More than 200,000 college students in California and 1.1 million nationwide are on SNAP, according to the state's Department of Social Services and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, respectively.",
      "Many students are facing tuition and housing bills, juggling classes, and often working lower paying part-time jobs that make it difficult to afford groceries, with prices on the rise.",
      "SNAP benefits for roughly 42 million people in the U.S. were cut off at the beginning of November due to the government shutdown. A federal judge last week ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the program, but late Friday the U.S. Supreme Court granted the administration's emergency appeal temporarily blocking the order. The mixed messaging has left students who rely on SNAP confused and colleges trying to curb hunger on campus by spreading awareness about food pantries and handing out free meals.",
      "\u201cIt just puts students in a really horrible position,\u201d said Mike Hannigan, a student at Greenfield Community College in Massachusetts and an advocate against food insecurity on college campuses.",
      "Hannigan receives just under $300 a month from SNAP, but the benefits didn\u2019t come through at the beginning of November due to government delays.",
      "If SNAP benefits keep getting delayed, he doesn't know what he would do to afford groceries, he said. Some students, including those at community colleges who don't have meal plans, may \u201chave to decide whether or not they are going to attend a class or they\u2019re going to pick up an extra shift to try to make money to be able to feed themselves or their families,\u201d Hannigan said.",
      "Hannigan and other students recently hosted a free farmers market on campus and gave out thousands of pounds of vegetables from local farms. Nothing was left over.",
      "Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, a tribal college of about 250 students in North Dakota, hosts \u2018Soup Tuesdays\u2019 to feed students on campus for free. Students can also access a food pantry and kits with easy-to-prep meals such as chicken Alfredo or chili, and they'll soon be able to pick up gift cards from the school to use at local grocery stores.",
      "Many people living on tribal land or in rural areas are in so-called food deserts with limited access to grocery stores, college President Twyla Baker said. The uncertainty over SNAP caused by the political stalemate in Washington adds another layer of difficulty.",
      "\u201cTo essentially use the most vulnerable as political pawns is just untenable,\" Baker said. \"It\u2019s unsustainable, and it\u2019s detrimental to the country as a whole.\u201d",
      "Food insecurity on college campuses has been on the rise in the past decade, and students have had to make tough choices about how to stretch their wallets to cover the necessities, said AJ Scheitler, director of the Data Equity Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, Center for Health Policy Research.",
      "\u201cStudents will first make sure that they pay for tuition and books and all that stuff so that they can stay enrolled at school,\" she said. \"After that, they concern themselves with transportation so that they can get to school, then housing, and then food almost becomes this category that you can go without if you have to if after all of those other categories you don\u2019t have any money.\u201d",
      "Sac State's food pantries host grocery pop ups on campus twice a month where students can pick up fresh produce for free, said Tupper, the school official. The college may hold the events more often if federal food aid keeps getting delayed.",

      "Between 100 and 150 students pop into the campus pantry every day, said Lisa Lindquist, director of the LoboRESPECT Advocacy Center. The pantry is free and open to all students. Some fill up baskets with as many as 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of food per visit, while others are looking for a snack to hold them over between classes.",
      "The pantry is fueled by donations, but there have been times when staffers have had to run out to the grocery to buy more items to keep the shelves stocked.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily for a lack of people donating, it\u2019s just that the food, it just goes in and out so quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cThat tells me anecdotally, there\u2019s great need.\u201d",
      "On a recent trip to the grocery store, July Star Medina, a senior studying biology at Sac State, was shocked she had to spend about $30 just to buy chicken and a few spices. She's had to make more frequent trips to the Basic Needs Resource Center in recent months because her SNAP benefits decreased from $290 to $120 a month this year. The assistance was lowered after she started working more hours during the summer, but it hasn\u2019t gone back up now that she\u2019s working less during the fall semester.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough at all,\u201d Medina said. \u201cAfter one week of groceries that\u2019ll last me maybe two weeks.\u201d",
      "The prospect of that $120 going away has been stressful, she said.",
      "\u201cAnd that's why I've been trying to come here to see what I can get,\u201d Medina said outside the center. \u201cNow I need to see where I can pull money aside to just get basic things.\u201d",
      "Scheitler, the UCLA researcher, said the uncertainty \u201cis just so rough\u201d for students.",
      "\u201cAnd the number of students who may have to drop out of school because they need to eat, their grades are going to fall,\" she said. \"Their mental health is going to be hurt by the stress of not being able to eat. This is going to have a significant impact if they can\u2019t figure out how to fix this and fix this quickly.\u201d",

      "The stylized font \u2014 with its drop shadow effect and vintage comic book look \u2014 was meant to evoke the old school, hand-painted signs that can still be found in some neighborhoods, he said.",
      "\u201cSuccinctly, it\u2019s New York,\u201d said Bhoopathy, who previously lived in New York and helped on past campaigns for Mamdani and the Queens chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "It was also trendsetting.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s main adversary, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, even rebranded midcampaign. The Democrat initially launched his mayoral run using a red, white and blue color scheme and a decidedly unfussy font, reminiscent of bumper stickers used by President John F. Kennedy in 1960.",
      "But after his defeat to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary, Cuomo kicked off his general election run as an independent candidate by rolling out a new logo featuring the silhouette of the Statue of Liberty\u2019s crown and a new color scheme: blue and orange \u2014 Mamdani\u2019s colors, but also the colors of the Knicks and Mets.",
      "Mamdani, who will be the city\u2019s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, is the son of two prominent Indian American luminaries, Columbia University professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair, who is known for \u201cMonsoon Wedding\u201d and other Hollywood films.",

      "\"They evoke the working-class fabric of New York City: the bodegas, taxi cabs, and halal carts that not only sustain the city but also reflect its cultural richness,\u201d he said.",
      "The decidedly retro vibe also likely helped foster \u201cpositive associations to happier political times,\u201d at least among Democratic voters, suggested Gavan Fitzsimons, a business professor at Duke University who studies the impact of branding on voters and consumers.",
      "\u201cIt has the feel of something from a prior era, an earlier time when politics was less divisive and the Democrats were perhaps more organized, more successful,\u201d he said.",
      "The branding was reminiscent of the distinctive campaign font that became a calling card for U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another youthful liberal New Yorker who shot to political fame, said Richard Flanagan, a political science professor at the College of Staten Island.",

      "Court Stroud, a marketing professor at New York University, said it\u2019s difficult to quantify how much the campaign visuals contributed to Mamdani\u2019s success, but they certainly made him recognizable and memorable in an initially crowded field of mayoral hopefuls.",
      "\u201cThe playfulness of his campaign design created a brand that supporters wanted to wear and share,\u201d he said. \u201cMamdani\u2019s team showed how using visual design as a secret handshake can make politics feel real and community driven.\u201d",
      "Campaign experts said it\u2019s also too early to say whether Mamdani\u2019s campaign designs will ultimately have the same staying power nationally as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s distinctive look, which has since become a staple of progressive candidate branding.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still rare for candidates to move away from the tried and true red, white, and blue,\u201d said Lisa Burns, a professor of media studies at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. \u201cI don\u2019t see that changing any time soon.\u201d",
      "The popularity of Mamdani's designs were certainly felt during the New York City mayoral race, helping inspire off-beat, viral campaigns such as the \u201cHot Girls for Zohran\u201d merch worn by model Emily Ratajkowski and other young celebs.",
      "Schwittek said the key takeaway from Mamdani\u2019s visual coup was that effective branding isn\u2019t generic or safe, but specific and deliberate.",
      "\u201cIn a sea of sanitized political messaging, Mamdani\u2019s visuals stand out because they mean something,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson.\u201d",
      "Good campaign design should also still ring true to the candidate, added Bhoopathy.",
      "\u201cNone of the boldness and vibrancy here works without a candidate that is as energetic and full of life as the city that raised him,\u201d he said.",

There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven\u2019t determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",

    "story": [
      "Billy Bob Thornton's irreverence mixes with his Southern charm like a good ol' whiskey sour. After all, he can deliver lines with a sincerity that is almost mocking. He even, with a wink and a nod, played a not-so-saintly St. Nick. Some saw that as a brave choice. He doesn't. \"A brave choice is to see someone being attacked in a park and go intervene; that's a brave choice,\" he said. \"It's not a brave choice to do some weird thing in the middle of a scene, you know what I mean?\"",
      "For his current role, he's making choices, too, mostly just to be himself. \"Well, I mean I pretty much am playing myself if I were a landman.\"",
      "In the Paramount+ show \"Landman,\" viewers get a peek behind the curtain of a world we really usually see. \"I mean, the movie 'Giant,' one of my favorites, I mean, that took place in the oil business of West Texas,\" he said. \"I always tell people that this is kind of like 'Giant,' with cursing!\"",
      "Fans have been waiting a long time for \"Landman\"'s second season. It debuts next Sunday.",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 2 of \"Landman\" click on the video player below:",
      "According to his co-star Ali Larter, Thornton doesn't like to rehearse. \"You have to be ready to go,\" she told us. \"Fresh. Like, whatever happens is going to happen.\"",
      "Thornton's hillbilly vibe isn't a put-on \u2013 he proudly calls himself a Tex-Arkansan, the product of a lot of rural places that even the railroads passed by.",
      "But he wouldn't trade growing up in a small town for anything: \"You know, I keep my upbringing in my back pocket all the time,\" he said. \"You never forget it.\"",
      "While he never worked on an oil rig, he did have his fair share of jobs where dangerous machinery decided if you came home at night or not. \"Machine shops and sawmills are both not exactly the safest places to work, especially when you're a dumb little skinny hippie kid with hair to your waist,\" he said. \"We always had a joke about sawmill workers, which was, do you know what this is? [He holds up three fingers.] It's a sawmill worker ordering five beers.\"",
      "He went from sawdust to Hollywood fairy dust in a pretty unconventional way. \"I only took drama 'cause I thought I gotta get a C in something, you know, because I was not good in school,\" he said.",
      "His idols were Robert Duvall, Bruce Dern, and Sam Elliott. But in Los Angeles, at a cocktail party where Thornton was working as a bus boy, famed screenwriter and director Billy Wilder told him acting wasn't for him.",
      "\"He said, 'Forget about it. You're too ugly to be a leading man,'\" Thornton recalled. \"And he said, 'You're too pretty to be a character actor.' I said, 'What do I do?' He said, 'Can you write?' I said, 'Yeah, I do write.' He goes, 'Write your own stories, create your own characters, don't stand in line with everybody else.'\"",
      "He did write his own story, and create his own character. \"Sling Blade\" (1996), which he wrote and directed, earned him an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, and an Oscar nomination for best actor to boot.",
      "Asked if he thinks he'll go back to writing and directing, he replied, \"You know, I don't know that anybody wants to see what I have to say as a director or writer, 'cause all my stuff is based on Southern literature. And I don't think that those stories would really be relevant to anyone right now. So, I doubt I ever do it again.\"",
      "Letting go of things he loves isn't easy. We were stunned to find out he hasn't felt truly care-free since the short-lived TV show \"The Outsiders\" \u2013 more than 30 years ago. \u00a0\"I had no responsibility,\" he said. \"I was making $2,500 an episode. Never thought I'd see that kind of money. Then, my brother Jimmy died, and changed my life. He was my best friend.\"",
      "\"So, that's when you talk about carrying it around in your back pocket?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "They both grew up playing in bands. To this day, Billy Bob still idolizes his brother's musical talent. \"He played every instrument, except drums,\" Thornton said. \"He looked like he had a disorder when he tried to play drums.\"",
      "Thornton never gave up his love of music. His band, The Boxmasters, has recorded 19 albums, and this past Summer they opened for The Who. \"We're just there to waste 45 minutes while they're getting ready, ya' know?\" he said. \"So hopefully the fans will be with us.\"",
      "He doesn't act his age, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have asked about it.",
      "\"Any thoughts on turning 70?\" I said.",
      "\"What did you say\" Thornton replied, raising an eyebrow. \"But uh, no, You know what, it's so funny you're scared of every milestone. But this one actually did affect me in a way that I had to, you know, have a few meetings with myself late at night.\"",
      "In the end, what Billy Bob Thornton has found is that he and so many of his older contemporaries, including his friend Sam Elliott (who is still acting with him at 81), are still defined by their good work.",
      "\"We've all seen each other get older,\" Thornton said. \"And when I see that wisdom and see the respect that people have for them, it just kind of makes everything melt away somehow. I mean, I'm in a successful band and I'm in a successful show. Every day when I wake up, I just say I'm blessed. That's really it.\"",

So, Buckley came to Hampstead Heath, a vast green space in London, where she'd go swimming each morning. \"I just need to be in nature and start my day and wake up that way, and then go to the set and see what came out,\" she said.",
      "She says \"Hamnet\" director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (an Oscar-winner for \"Nomadland\") reminded her cinema is not just escapism. \"Our jobs as actors and the storytellers are to touch the most heightened expressions that are too hard to hold on our own,\" Buckley said. \"I get to incubate the bits of us, myself, the shadow bits.\"",
      "\"What are the shadow bits of you that came out for this role?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not telling you!\" she laughed. \"You have to watch it and make up your own mind.\"",
      "\"The sacred flame of star quality\"",
      "Her breakthrough role was playing a single mom just out of prison in 2018's \"Wild Rose.\" Then, in 2022, Buckley got an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in \"The Lost Daughter.\" Her other credits included \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things,\" \"Beast\" and \"Women Talking,\" and the TV series \"Fargo.\"",
      "She said, \"I never in a million years thought I'd make a film.\"",
      "Because? \"I didn't have a TV 'til I was 15,\" she said. \"And it was exotic, like, it was in Hollywood. It wasn't in Kerry.\"",
      "In rugged County Kerry, in Ireland's southeast, Buckley grew up in an artistic family, playing harp, clarinet and piano. She sang and did school productions. But it was the British talent show, \"I'd Do Anything,\" that put her on a bigger stage \u2013 and in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber. He praised her, saying, \"Jessie has the sacred flame of star quality.\"",
      "She lost that competition, but quickly landed theater roles. Her first Shakespeare performance was near the spot in London where Shakespeare's early plays were first performed, at the original Rose Playhouse, built in 1587.",
      "Shakespeare changed everything for her: \"I think before, I felt like music was the only way to contain what was kind of wanting to come out, and then Shakespeare's words and his worlds were so titanic that it just made me realize how powerful words could be,\" she said.",
      "Of acting opposite Mescal in \"Hamnet,\" Buckley said, \"I absolutely adore that man. And from our very first chemistry read \u2026\"",
      "\"Chemistry read is to make sure you have chemistry?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" she laughed. \"I mean, it would be really depressing if I didn't, wouldn't it? I'd be like the only woman in the world who failed to find chemistry with Paul Mescal!\"",
      "The 35-year-old actor says she also found chemistry with Christian Bale for her next film, in which she plays the bride of Frankenstein's monster. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhall, it's genre- and expectation-bending.\u00a0 \"It's punk, it is proper punk,\" Buckley said. \"I remember when I read it first, it was like being plugged into an electrical socket.\"",
      "I said, \"Maggie Gyllenhaal referred to you as kind of a wild animal.\"",
      "\"Hmm. Good,\" Buckley said.",
      "\"Do you think there's a truth to that?\"",
      "\"I have a lot of life in me!\"",
      "That life and vitality that we now see on film is the journey that brought Buckley to London as a teenager. At the time, she says, she was in a dark place. \"I had depression and I wasn't very well,\" she said. \"And I wanted a lot from life. I was really hungry for it. And I felt like there was no place for that. And I think that's when it imploded in on me, and when I got sick and lost myself, you know?\"",
      "\"How did your deal with it?\"",
      "\"I got help,\" she replied. \"I got therapy. Singing. I mean, I honestly think it's kind of saved me. Something wasn't alive then, let's just say, like it is now.\"",

    "story": [
      "People often discuss which Hollywood star might play them in a movie about their life. For legendary boxer Christy Martin, the actor turned out to be Sydney Sweeney. Sweeney transformed into \"Christy,\" which hits theaters on Nov. 7.",
      "Before Martin's story was told on the big screen, she sat down with \"48 Hours\" in 2020 to share her story.\u00a0An encore of \"Christy Martin \u2013 the Fight of her Life\"\u00a0airs Saturday, Nov. 8, at 9/8c on CBS and streams on Paramount+.",
      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

      "\"This is for every woman who picked up a mic when they told her she couldn't,\" Cheryl \"Salt\" James said Saturday while accepting the musical influence award that made her, Sandra \"Pepa\" Denton and DJ Spinderella members of the hall.",

      "\"The industry still doesn't want to play fair, Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight,\" James said.",
      "They took the stage for a medley of their hits. They opened with \"Shoop\" then slid into \"Let's Talk About Sex\" before En Vogue joined them for their joint hit \"What a Man.\" \"Push It\" pushed the energy up another notch.",
      "Spinderella became the first female DJ to enter the hall.",
      "\"The female rappers had to step to the mic and show that they could go toe to toe with the guys. And Salt, Pepa and Spinderella did it,\" Missy Elliott said while inducting the trio.",
      "Chappell Roan was set to induct Cyndi Lauper.",
      "Outkast don't perform, but appear together",
      "Outkast didn't perform together for the first time since 2016 as some had hoped, but the duo stood together on stage, surrounded by a crew of friends and cohorts as they gave grateful speeches after doing rock-paper-scissors to decide who would go first.",
      "Andre 3000 gave a long, rambling funny speech \u2014 \"I'm freestylin' y'all!\" \u2014 that ended in tears when he talked about their very beginnings in a basement \"dungeon\" in Atlanta in the early 1990s.",
      "He choked out the words, \"Great things start in little rooms.\"",
      "Andre sat out the performance but Big Boi, wearing shorts and a fur coat, started off an express tour through the Atlanta duo's discography that included Tyler the Creator, JID and Killer Mike.",
      "Janelle Mon\u00e1e joined them to shake her way through \"Hey Ya\" and Doja Cat delivered a sly and soulful take on \"Ms. Jackson.\"",

      "An emotional Jim Carrey remembers Chris Cornell while inducting Soundgarden",
      "Emotions ran deep during Soundgarden's segment of the night, starting with the induction speech of Jim Carrey, the actor and Soundgarden super-fan who seemed to be fighting off tears throughout as he talked about Cornell, who died from suicide in 2017.",
      "\"When you looked into his eyes, it's like eternity was staring back,\" Carrey said. \"For all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.\"",
      "Each of his bandmates, all major godfathers of the Seattle grunge scene, paid their own tearful tributes.",
      "One of Cornell's daughters, Lilian, spoke for him while another, Toni, sang a quiet rendition of his song \"Fell on Black Days.\"",
      "\"I am just really really happy that he got to make music with his friends,\" Lilian Cornell said.",
      "Taylor Momsen, who co-starred as a child with Carrey in \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" and Brandi Carlile showed serious vocal power with their versions of Cornell's mighty wail, backed by his bandmates on \"Rusty Cage\" and \"Black Hole Sun.\"",
      "Bassist Hiro Yamamoto was among the few who brought up the politics of the moment from the stage.",
      "\"Thanks to my parents, whose story is American citizens who are rounded up and placed into prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II,\" Yamamoto said to some of the biggest cheers of the night. \"Well that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today.

      "Meg White not in attendance for induction of The White Stripes",
      "The White Stripes reunion that some fans had hoped for didn't happen. Their induction was among the highlights of the night anyway. Twenty One Pilots brought the house down with a version of the duo's stadium-shaking anthem \"Seven Nation Army\" and Olivia Rodrigo and Feist doing a mid-audience acoustic version of \"We're Gonna Be Friends.\"",
      "Their fellow Detroit rock legend Iggy Pop began his induction speech by leading the crowd in a chorus of \"Seven Nation Army\" then remembered his thoughts on meeting them.",
      "\"Cute kids, they're gonna go places,\" Pop said. \"And they did.\"",
      "Drummer Meg White, who has led an almost entirely private life since the band broke up in 2011, did not show up for the ceremony, but Jack White said Meg, his ex-wife, helped him write the speech he delivered while wearing the band's signature red and white.",
      "Jack White shouted out several great duos from across culture and said that kind of one-on-one collaboration is \"the most beautiful thing you can have as an artist and musician.\"",

      "Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac began the ceremony proper by inducting Bad Company. He called the British group founded by Paul Rodgers and Mick Ralphs in 1973 \"classic rock legends\" and \"one of the first super groups,\" but said that, more importantly, \"they were four great musicians who came together for the love of music.\"",
      "Rodgers had to skip the ceremony because of health issues and Ralphs died earlier this year, so drummer Simon Kirke was the only member who took the stage.",
      "He was joined by an ad hoc super group that blasted through a few of the super group's biggest hits.",
      "Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson took lead vocals on their hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" with Nancy Wilson of Heart and Joe Perry of Aerosmith on guitars. Bryan Adams took the stage to sing \"Can't Get Enough.\"",
      "\"I've never played in a tuxedo before\" said Kirke as he accepted the honor for the group.",

      "A clip was shown from Zevon's final appearance on the show in 2002, when he was dying of cancer. \"Enjoy every sandwich,\" Zevon said when Letterman asked what he'd learned about mortality.",
      "Letterman was tearful as he showed the crowd a guitar that Zevon gave him later that night.",
      "\"He's never going away,\" Bruce Springsteen said in a recorded tribute. \"He's got a body of work that's as good as anybody's.\"",
      "Letterman outlined several categories of Zevon's cleverly emotional tunes, the final one being \"songs about werewolves\" to a big laugh from the crowd. 1978's \"Werewolves of London\" was Zevon's biggest, and most unlikely, hit.",
      "The Killers then played Zevon's second-biggest hit, \"Lawyers, Guns and Money.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

    "summary": "Artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions around the world, but some are surprised to learn she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "Popular music artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions, but some fans were shocked to discover she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",

      "The Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0mixed martial arts company has cut fighter Issac Dulgarian, days after his loss by first round submission to Yadier del Valle during Saturday's Fight Night prompted a probe of possible pre-bout irregular betting patterns.",
      "This makes the UFC the latest sports entity navigating a possible gambling-related integrity issue, joining Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, which recently saw FBI arrests connected to a gambling investigation.",
      "Suspicious gambling activity was reportedly flagged after the odds on Dulgarian, the favorite, changed rapidly in the hours leading up to the bout, leading several major sports betting sites to stop taking wagers on the contest due to the betting patterns.",
      "The UFC said in a statement Monday: \"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events. Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"",
      "The controversy may have played out in the Octagon. Cageside commentators Daniel Cormier and Michael Chiesa called the submission \"white belt stuff\" on air, implying that sloppy actions led to the loss.",
      "The integrity of specific UFC bouts has faced scrutiny before, most notably for contests involving former UFC veteran and coach James Krause. He was investigated for allegedly using his background in mixed martial arts to offer insights to offshore sportsbooks and bettors. Krause was also suspended by the UFC for failing to disclose a fighter's pre-fight injury. He was never charged with any crimes.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "Read the excerpt below, and don't miss Dr. Jon LaPook's interview with Carrie Richardson and her daughter Hannah, who are participating in a clinical trial at Washington University School of Medicine   in St. Louis studying Alzheimer's, on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",

      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",

      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through. I can do this, and it will help, and that will be something I can be doing that's proactive to help my family and other families and everyone in the Alzheimer's and dementia community.",
      "\"I think my wish is like everybody else's \u2014 I want there to be a cure or treatment, because it terrifies me to think that I could have this. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings. Knowing there's nothing right now, you just feel so hopeless and helpless. I think that's part of the reason why I want to go into research, because I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless. That is what scares me most in the entire world.\"",

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

    "summary": "Washington University Medicine in St. Louis is conducting important research into treating early-onset Alzheimer's before symptoms arise.",
    "story": [
      "\"I just know that my brain's not right,\" said Carrie Richardson, 44. \"And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal.\"",
      "At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. \"I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44,\" she said \u2026 including her son, Bryan, who died last year.",
      "Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. \"It's the least I can do to help,\" said Hannah. \"I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it.\"",
      "Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, \"Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before.\"",
      "One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques \u2013 the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.",
      "\"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed,\" Bateman said. \"It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate.\"",
      "The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: \"If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important.\"",
      "Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. \"In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia,\" Bateman said. \"And we know about when they're going to get it.\"",
      "Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.",
      "\"A death sentence\"",
      "Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. \"Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s,\" he said.",
      "For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was \"a death sentence.\"",
      "He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. \"I was at an age where I should have been showing signs,\" Heinrichs said, \"and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive.\"",
      "His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. \"Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration's budget cuts have stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. \"It's a precarious time,\" he said. \"Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby \u2026 if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable.\"",
      "\"Let's double-down on this disease\"",
      "With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. \"The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago,\" he said. \"So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease.\"",
      "That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. \"I'm going to stay very involved in this,\" he said.",
      "At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. \"It's quite up in the air,\" Gates said. \"If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead.\"",
      "Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. \"He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care,\" said Gates. \"But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back.\"",
      "Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And \u2013 surprise \u2013 he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. \"AI is going to impact everything we do,\" he said. \"The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster.\"",
      "The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.",
      "Could people be tested now? Bateman said, \"Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms.\"",
      "Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.",
      "Bateman said, \"If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life.\"",
      "So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny.",
      "Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science \u2013 and a leap of faith.",
      "I asked Jake, \"What made you finally say, you know what, even though there's a 50-percent chance he might get the gene, we're going to go ahead and try to have a baby?\"",
      "\"Because I've been part of this study, and it seems to be effective,\" Jake replied. \"It gave me hope that the scourge of Alzheimer's is something that we're not going to fear in the future. Anything could happen. But right now, I have hope.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered MD-11 and MD-11F aircrafts to be grounded as authorities investigate the deadly UPS plane crash in Kentucky.",
      "The emergency airworthiness directive came after UPS and FedEx said they are voluntarily grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Louisville.",
      "The FAA's order was issued \"because the agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,\" the document obtained by CBS News read.",
      "\"We are assessing any potential safety issues and will ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu. National Transportation Safety Board official Todd Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane\u00a0was a\u00a01991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that had been \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter.",
      "MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.",
      "\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" a UPS statement said late Friday. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"",
      "FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts \"a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.\"",
      "The planes were built by McDonnell Douglas, but the company merged with Boeing in 1997, making Boeing the manufacturer of record for the aircraft. Boeing told CBS News in a statement that it made the recommendation to ground the aircraft \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Boeing's Safety Review Board assessed all available information about the crash and determined that further engineering analysis was needed, a company spokesperson told CBS News via email. The manufacturer recommended pausing fleet operations while that analysis was conducted. Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane was currently being \"handled\" by Boeing.",
      "Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000. There are about 70 MD-11 planes in operation today. The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Witnesses recalled chaos on the ground.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Georgie Dow, the chief financial officer of an auto parts business that was struck by the plane, told CBS News. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",

    "story": [
      "Retailers are betting they can handle the holiday shopping rush with fewer additional workers.",
      "From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization.",
      "That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF.",
      "At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%.",
      "The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020.",
      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",
      "Despite\u00a0diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said.",
      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "The FAA has issued at least 125 ground delays or stops due to staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, compared with 26 in September, according to a CBS News analysis of Air Traffic Control System Command Center Advisories. That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" he said. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",

    "summary": "Travel pros are urging people to brace for flight disruptions as the FAA throttles back air traffic starting on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership.

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Trade experts expect some U.S. tariffs to remain elevated even if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's IEEPA levies.",
    "story": [
      "High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts.",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur\u00a0domestic manufacturing.",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports.",
      "\"Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,\" Murphy said. \"The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward \u2014 it just might be under different tariff authorities.\"",
      "Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices.",
      "Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA.",
      "\"Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,\" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight.",
      "Potential tariff refunds",
      "An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, a plaintiff in the IEEPA case before the Supreme Court, \"I definitely want my money back,\" adding that the \"government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax.\"",
      "The U.S. has an average\u00a0tariff rate of 18%, the highest tax on foreign goods since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Although a ruling against Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA could lead to a refund for businesses, it could also sow more uncertainty, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS News.",
      "\"It would be unlikely to significantly alter where we see tariffs ending up in our forecast, and the economic implications,\" she said. \"It is only going to lead to heightened uncertainty regarding trade policy, so it might have a lagged impact on hiring and business investment, similar to what we saw earlier this year.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would turn to other laws as an avenue for imposing tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against him on using IEEPA.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Wednesday told Fox Business that he's optimistic that the court will rule in Mr. Trump's favor.",
      "\"I'm confident that the President's emergency powers\u2026we did have emergencies, the President has dealt with them. He's continuing to deal with them,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Federal officials announced that the U.S. will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \"high-volume\" markets starting on Friday, citing staffing shortages related to the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "\"We have decided that a 10% reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our controllers,\" Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Bedford and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new measures are necessary to keep air travel safe, as pressures on air traffic controllers mount during the longest government shutdown in history.",
      "Bedford said he would specify which 40 markets around the country will be affected on Thursday, adding that the restrictions will affect commercial airspace and other activities, including space launches.",
      "A source late Wednesday night provided CBS News with a proposed list of the 40 markets that included major hubs such as Boston Logan International, New York LaGuardia, Los Angeles International and Dallas/Fort Worth International. The provided list was not final and could change.",
      "More air traffic controllers are exhibiting fatigue as they work without pay during the congressional stalemate, now in its 36th day, Bedford added. Thursday will mark one month since controllers were last paid.",
      "Airlines, aviation unions and the wider travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while roughly 11,000 trips have been delayed this week, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "The U.S. struggled to recruit sufficient numbers of air traffic controllers even before the shutdown began, with Duffy saying that the country needs an additional 2,000 controllers.",
      "Bedford and Duffy said they would consult later Wednesday with airline industry executives to discuss how to safely implement the reduction in flights.",
      "\"The early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating,\" Bedford said.",
      "The cuts will likely be phased in beginning Friday, according to two sources familiar with the contents of a call held later Wednesday between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and airline representatives.",
      "The airlines have yet to receive an official order from the FAA laying out the requirements of the capacity reduction, but are operating under the understanding they will need to reduce their schedules by at least 4% on Friday, at least 5% on Saturday and hit the 10% mark for next week in those 40 markets, the sources said. Since the FAA order has not been issued, this could still change.",
      "The two sources said the switch to a phased-in approach may come about out of concern that the request to slash complex airline schedules in 48 hours was going to be fraught with the potential of major disruptions for flyers.",
      "CBS News has reached out to DOT for comment on the details of the capacity reduction. When reached by CBS News, the FAA deferred to DOT.",
      "Several airline sources described to CBS News confusion over how the reduction will be applied, by what mechanism, and if it is going to be tied to actual staffing levels.",
      "The decision caught airlines by surprise, and they are now scrambling to make plans, the airline sources said.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, American Airlines said that it would operate \"as planned\" on Thursday, but that it was \"awaiting additional information from the FAA to determine which flights will be impacted\" on Friday, but that it expected \"the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected.\"",
      "United Airlines said in a statement that it will update its schedule once the flight reductions begin so the carrier can notify customers of any changes \"several days\" in advance.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health regulators sent warning letters Wednesday to 18 websites selling counterfeit or unapproved versions of Botox and similar injectable drugs commonly used to smooth wrinkles.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",
      "The FDA warning letters mostly went to cosmetics websites. In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",
      "In a press release Wednesday, the FDA said patients should only receive the drugs from health professionals who are licensed and trained to administer them. Patients experiencing signs of botulism should \"seek immediate medical care,\" the agency noted.",

      "Starbucks unionized workers say they plan to strike on Nov. 13 \u2014 when the coffee chain will hold its annual Red Cup Day promotion \u2014 unless the company finalizes a labor contract by that date.",
      "Starbucks Workers United announced Wednesday that its members voted to authorize a strike as they push to secure a first contract that offers them better pay and more flexible hours. Thousands of union members weighed in, with an overwhelming majority \u2014 92% \u2014 voting in favor of the strike, according to the labor group.",
      "The union said if Starbucks doesn't deliver a contract in the next week, the strike would begin the same day as Starbucks' Red Cup Day, an annual event intended to drum up business for the coffee giant's holiday menu.",
      "The strike would start at coffee shops in 25 U.S. cities, with additional stores later joining in if no progress is made, according to a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.",
      "\"The ball is in Starbucks' court,\" Michelle Eisen, a union spokesperson and barista at Starbucks, said in a statement.",
      "If the strike happens this month, it would mark the union's third national work stoppage in the past year. Workers United last protested in May over Starbucks' new dress code, and thousands also walked off the job in December 2024.",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News the company is disappointed that the union voted to authorize a strike instead of coming to the bargaining table.",
      "\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Negotiations at a standstill",
      "Starbucks Workers United, which\u00a0started in upstate New York in 2021, has grown to represent more than 9,500 baristas across 550 Starbucks cafes, still a relatively small percentage of total Starbucks workers. Overall, the company has more than 200,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but have bogged down. The union is asking for increased hours for workers and higher take-home pay, among other demands.",
      "According to Anderson, the union has proposed an immediate pay increase of 65%, and 77% total over three years. The union spokesperson disputed that claim, saying the union had presented several separate wage proposals during negotiations, which Starbucks then combined as if they were a single request.",
      "The union has also asked for added pay if they work a shift within three hours of opening or closing, during a promotional event, or over the weekend, Anderson said.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0recently told CBS News that he's open to talking with union members, but said that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" he said. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Starbucks employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits, while store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried.",
      "Union members, for their part, say the pay isn't enough for them to get by.",
      "\"Our fight is about actually making Starbucks jobs the best jobs in retail,\" Jasmine Leli, a Starbucks barista from Buffalo, New York, said in a statement. \"Right now, it's only the best job in retail for Brian Niccol.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:05:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The shape of economic growth this year highlights the widening gap between wealthy Americans and everyone else, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "To understand how Americans are faring economically these days, it's helpful to consider the eleventh letter of the alphabet.",
      "Experts describe the current U.S. economy as \"K-shaped,\" a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the \"K\" represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans.",
      "By contrast, the letter's lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs.",
      "This bifurcation of the economy isn't a new phenomenon, with inequality on the rise since the 1980s, noted Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. But the divide in income and wealth has grown more skewed since the pandemic, reflecting the \"growing gap between the wealthy and the well-to-do and everyone else,\" he said. \"It's taken off.\"",
      "Several trends help explain what's behind the emergence of a K-shaped economy.",
      "Consumer spending",
      "Consumer spending \u2014 which drives over two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 is growing overall in the U.S. These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an\u00a0analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi.",
      "\"That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it's ever been in the data,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Other data tells a similar tale. In September, spending by lower-income households grew 0.6% from a year ago, compared with 2.6% for higher-income consumers, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Bank of America Institute.",
      "Spending on U.S. luxury fashion was also up 8% year-over-year in October, according to the bank's data \u2014 another sign that wealthier households are driving spending.",
      "\"Younger, less affluent households are facing ongoing challenges, while older, wealthier consumers are driving overall spending growth,\" said Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Record stock prices",
      "Because much of their income is held in stock and other securities, affluent Americans have particularly benefited from this year's run-up in financial markets, which have notched record after record largely on the strength of investor excitement about artificial intelligence.",
      "A May Gallup\u00a0poll found that 87% of Americans who own stock live in households with incomes of $100,000 or more. The top 1% of income earners \u2014 who on average earn around $731,000 per year, according to personal finance site SmartAsset \u2014 own nearly half of corporate securities and mutual funds, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "A bullish stock market also benefits the millions of employees with 401(k), mutual funds and other investments, but does much less to lift the many Americans without such holdings, said Tuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, an audit, tax and consulting firm.",
      "\"For lower- and middle-income people, especially the ones that live paycheck to paycheck, the rally in the equity markets might not be relatable to them because they are facing higher inflation and lower wage growth,\" he said.",
      "Of late, better-heeled Americans have also seen stronger pay gains. According to the Bank of America Institute, the rate of wage growth for higher-income households in September rose to 4% year-over-year. Annualized pay growth for lower-income households as of August fell to 0.9%, the lowest since the financial giant started tracking the data in 2016, said Taylor Bowley, an economist at the Bank of America Institute.",
      "What lower-income people \"see from the grocery store, from the gas stations, is that prices are going up while their wages are not going up,\" Nguyen added.",
      "Lower-income households also face a toxic stew of inflation, credit card debt, student loans and mortgage loans, sapping their spending power. They also feel the pinch of a slowing job market more acutely than high-income groups, Zandi told CBS News.",
      "\"They may have a job, although if they lose one, they're having a harder and harder time getting back into the labor market,\" he said.",

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a late-night Saturday memo, also threatened to impose financial penalties on states that did not comply with the government's new orders.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has instructed states that they must \"immediately undo any steps\" that were taken to provide full SNAP benefits to low-income Americans, saying states were \"unauthorized.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a late-night Saturday memo obtained by CBS News, also threatened to impose financial penalties on states that did not comply with the government's new orders.",
      "\"To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,\" Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of Agriculture, wrote to state SNAP directors. \"Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "The Trump administration initially said last month that it would not fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for November because of the ongoing government shutdown. The twists and turns since have exacerbated uncertainty for the nearly 1 in 8 Americans who receive monthly SNAP benefits to spend at grocery stores and farmers' markets.",
      "On Friday, some states began issuing full monthly SNAP benefits to people, a day after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide the funds. Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey were among the states that said on Friday they were moving to issue full benefits to SNAP recipients.",
      "But Friday night, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u00a0temporarily paused that judicial order\u00a0to give an appeals court in Boston time to decide whether to issue a more lasting halt. Jackson acted because she handles emergency matters from Massachusetts.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and the Department of Agriculture for additional comments on the new guidance.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said there is no clarity from the government on funding SNAP benefits over the last several days.",
      "\"There is a chaos and it is an intentional chaos that we are seeing from this administration and where they have money for everything,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"They got money to fight wars. They got money for ballrooms. They got money for everything but when it's to supporting the people, that's now when they are crying, well, we are broke and that's not what the law requires us to do.\"",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, on Sunday called the directive \"shocking\" if it applies to states, like hers, that used their own money to prop up the program.",
      "\"It's one thing if the federal government is going to continue its level of appeal through the courts to say, no, this can't be done,\" Murkowski said. \"But when you are telling the states that have said this is a significant enough issue in our state, we're going to find resources, backfill or front load, whatever term you want, to help our people, those states should not be penalized.\"",
      "Democratic Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts said SNAP benefits were processed and placed on EBT cards before the U.S. Supreme Court order Friday night, in line with the previous guidance from the USDA. She said that if Trump attempts to claw back the money, \"we will see him in court.\"",
      "\"Massachusetts residents with funds on their cards should continue to spend it on food,\" she said in a statement Sunday. \"President Trump should be focusing on reopening the government that he controls instead of repeatedly fighting to take away food from American families.\"",
      "Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, for help buying groceries. Most have incomes below the poverty line, which is about $32,000 for a family of four.",
      "An individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income.",
      "The delay in payments has led to a surge in demand at food banks and pantries across the country, as well as long lines for free meals or drive-thru giveaways.",
      "Some states have provided emergency funding to food banks to help them respond to the increased need. Some states also used their own dollars to fund direct payments to people while the federal benefits were in limbo.",
      "The New York Times first reported on the USDA's memo.",

    "summary": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, announced last week the creation of a commission to look at mid-decade redistricting.",
    "story": [
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday defended the creation of a redistricting committee to edge out the single Republican-held seat in his state, saying he's \"not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.\"",
      "\"I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"That's not the way this process is going to work.\"",
      "Last week, Moore announced he had formed a commission to explore mid-decade redistricting in the state, following the lead of President Trump's push to redraw districts in GOP-led states Texas, Missouri and North Carolina to net more seats for Republicans.",
      "While Democrats initially decried Mr. Trump's efforts as an attempt to create an unfair advantage for Republicans, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts to gain up to five seats for Democrats. The measure, known as Prop 50, passed Tuesday with more than 60% of the vote, and an energized Newsom held a rally in Houston on Saturday, where he said Texas had \"woke us up.\"",
      "Eight of Maryland's nine House seats are already occupied by Democrats, a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 28 points in 2024. A redistricting effort would target the single Republican-held seat in the eastern part of the state.",
      "Maryland's commission is chaired by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, a close ally of Moore's, and is comprised of Senate President Bill Ferguson, Maryland House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, former Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Raymond Morriss.",
      "Maryland law dictates congressional maps are drawn by the state Assembly, where Democrats have a supermajority. Moore would have to call a special session of the Assembly to move forward with the effort.",
      "But Ferguson, a Democrat, has opposed the redistricting effort, writing in a letter last month that \"mid-cycle redistricting for Maryland presents a reality where the legal risks are too high, the timeline for action is dangerous, the downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic, and the certainty of our existing map would be undermined.\"",
      "Ferguson said last week the Democrats' election victories \"shows we don't need to rig the system to win.\"",
      "But Moore insisted Sunday that \"fighting for democracy is never risky.\" He noted that he and Ferguson agree that there is a \"crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.\"",
      "\"Where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires,\" Moore said. \"And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.\"",

      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said.",

      "As well as the edit of Mr. Trump, the dossier criticized the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns about alleged anti-Israel bias in the BBC's Arabic service.",

      "This is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to U.S. troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Right. I think that that's about the right number.",
      "And the problem is that, under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that, if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties.",
      "And so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really, really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open.",
      "I mean, the fact is, Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5 percent off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays.",

      "But to the point you were just making about food stamps \u2013 and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA.",
      "But why not do this as a short-term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, the president's job and all of our jobs is to uphold the law.",
      "And when \u2013 I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us\u2026",

      "But the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes, which, you know, you know about \u2013 in the season of lawfare, if you are a Cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your Cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 if \u2013 if Congress is going to fund it, when the shutdown ends?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We've seen Democrats take to court people that \u2013 on really, really poor, poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, we \u2013 we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid; 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now.",
      "I know you're talking to the governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the health care premiums, but do that through regular order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 so, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about health care.",
      "But the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said: \"I'm recommending to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad health care provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own, much better health care.\"",
      "He also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about health care right now.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an offer?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And what he \u2013 this is \u2013 you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open.",
      "And one of the things you could do is, conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And, you know, everybody believes that people should have health care, and so why not take the people who have higher health care premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide?",
      "The reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance. And it could be that people would rather have the money and go from, like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And so that's \u2013 that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy \u2013 I haven't talked to him about it yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 this proposal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The president has \u2013 started this idea yesterday. I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's the weekend.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate's in session this weekend.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend. And we are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they're trying to end the shutdown.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And here I am.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Current \u2013 as of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on health care, that health care costs are too high?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I think that, if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they were worried about the budgetary costs.",
      "And so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team, would be about $120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases.",
      "And I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing \u2013 again, most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability.",
      "And our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38 percent, the lowest of this term; 75 percent of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices.",
      "But the president said this week Democrats are making it up and \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Every price is down.\"",
      "I'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3 percent in September from a year ago.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, but let's go through \u2013 let's go through the facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you dispute that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, let \u2013 actually, yes, let's go through the facts, right?",
      "So, inflation went up about 5 percent under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7 percent. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it depends on which item.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, let me \u2013 I will just make a point, that if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000, because we had up to 9 percent inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying.",
      "The real spending power adjusted for inflation under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year; $1,200 is not $3,000. And so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the things, the positive things, about the economy, industrial production just about at an all-time high, capital spending about at an all-time high\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 GDP growth right now about 4 percent, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening.",
      "And the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected. And it was actually \u2013 would have been even lower, because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming.",
      "But we understand 100 percent why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3 percent inflation?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2 percent inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no, you're not happy where things are now?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think \u2013 well, they have got to go down a little bit more, but there \u2013 but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say.",
      "So when you go from almost 4 percent that we had in January\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 down to the mid 2's, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half-a- percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two-tenths and five-tenths.",
      "And the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. So, it would be a one-time level adjust.",
      "Our estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is, you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs, because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there's a tariff, and so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the U.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here in person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Great to be here, of course. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there for now.",
      "We'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore.",
      "Good to have you here in person.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Great to be with you. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid.",
      "Since the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting.",
      "It is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks, that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid.",
      "And I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the president of the United States to finally do his job.",
      "We are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts.",
      "The USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments, and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all? Like, what's the federal government telling you?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no clarity \u2013 clarity at all.",
      "In the past \u2013 in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it, where, initially, it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help to support, and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people.",
      "And then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK, we have now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are fronting the money?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That we are going to front the money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money.",
      "There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos, that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars. They got money for ballrooms. They got money for everything.",
      "But when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those \u2013 those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on \u2013 on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself, on Friday, we did see the Democratic leader, Schumer, offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies.",
      "Republicans said that's a \u2013 that's a nonstarter. This is going to make \u2013 this is a big issue for the midterms. But would you \u2013 would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in, that the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end for an extension of a tax credit?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland.",
      "We have over 260,000 federal workers within our state, that, even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country.",
      "But I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90 percent, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar \u2013 there's a \u2013 there's a \u2013 there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump \u2013 you know, the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate.",
      "They can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government.",
      "Why isn't that good enough?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Why \u2013 why\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to - - to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care, that when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia \u2013 and I'm proud to serve as the as the \u2013 as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional \u2013 Regional Commission, where we're serving Appalachia, all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania.",
      "And when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say, yes, it's OK, if you just watch my health care go away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up even in the private market for a lot of different reasons.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland.",
      "This past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50; 64 percent of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats.",
      "This is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this \u2013 go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland.",
      "I'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas or than Florida or than Ohio or all these other places.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process.",
      "It's the reason that I have \u2013 I put together this commission, where my job is not to draw the maps, that what we've just simply said is, I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that, if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to, that that's not the way this process is going to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your State Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, says this could backfire.",
      "He wrote: \"I believe mid-cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short-term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration.\"",
      "How do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials. And\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this commission provides to you?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I think the commission \u2013 what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps.",
      "And, frankly, it's the state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate president and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.",
      "He agrees on the fact that we have watched an administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply \u2013 and where we \u2013 where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires.",
      "And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Democratic governor-elect of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger. She joins us this morning from Glen Allen, just outside of Richmond.",
      "Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-Virginia) (Governor-Elect): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Virginia boasts one of the highest numbers of federal workers in the country, and, as you know, many of them are not getting paid.",
      "You know, some in your party look at your election on Tuesday and the win in New Jersey and say that is permission to hold the line in Congress and refuse to fund the government or fold on the shutdown. Should congressional Democrats view your victory that way?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Absolutely not.",
      "Our victory was a victory that was based on a campaign that was addressing concerns related to costs and chaos. My campaign across the past two years had been focused on hearing the challenges that people are facing all across Virginia.",
      "It's rising costs in health care, housing, energy, and it's the chaos coming out of Washington that has been impacting Virginians so severely, beginning with the DOGE efforts, of course, continuing with chaotic trade policies, and now in this government shutdown.",
      "Virginians need to and Virginians want to see the government reopen. And my expectation is that we will see a Congress, a Senate, and ultimately a president, driving us in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should congressional Democrats open the government and then talk about health care?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The government needs to open, and it needs to open immediately.",
      "We need the president to demonstrate leadership, bringing people together, endeavoring to get through whatever negotiations need to get through, whether it's before or after. My priority is the \u2013 is focusing on the needs and the \u2013 the devastation, frankly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: \u2026 that more than 300,000 Virginians are facing.",
      "And that's just the federal employees, government contractors. They will never get made whole. The entirety of Virginia's economy is impacted by the shutdown, just as we've been impacted by DOGE attacks, and the government needs to reopen quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why I'm asking, because there are, what, 825,000 enrollees on food aid in the SNAP program. They're in limbo right now.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have immediate pain. So, at what point do you weigh that against the potential of health care premiums? I mean, this pain is very real and very acute for people in your state right now.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And it's been going on now for weeks, weeks too long. The government needs to reopen because, in addition to the pain that we are already seeing federal employees and government contractors facing\u2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But eight Democrats could cross the aisle and do so.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We absolutely need everyone to vote to open the government.",
      "And that's not to say that the challenges we're facing within our health care system are not also immediate and acute. Even the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill will have catastrophic impacts on Virginia, taking $26 billion out of our health care, leading to the closure of at least six rural hospitals.",
      "We've already seen three rural clinics announce their closure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Hundreds of thousands will lose their Medicaid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And so the impacts on health care are already catastrophic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: But we cannot compound that pain by keeping the government closed.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We return to our conversation with Virginia Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger.",
      "Governor-elect, artificial intelligence has created a really big demand for these data centers. And Virginia has the world's largest concentration of them. Power bills are up nearly seven percent in your state over the past year. Is that driven by the A.I. boom? And, if so, how do you offset those rising energy costs?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): Well, what we've seen in the \u2013 in the research so far is that it is not \u2013 the increase costs are not driven by the increase in data centers. There's, you know, some bad energy policies in some of our neighboring states that have driven up prices, particularly in southwest Virginia.",
      "But looking towards the future, we have to be clear-eyed about the fact that we will have an energy crisis headed into the future. And so here, on the ground in Virginia, we currently have a rate (ph) case where it will be important that large-scale energy users, particularly data centers, that the public know that they are paying their fair share for the energy that they are using. And we have to increase our energy production here at home so that we can meet the demand certainly of larger-scale energy users but also of increased demand from our communities.",
      "And it is a real challenge that we have to get ahead of. And that's why among the first affordability plans that I laid out was one focused on energy. It's a challenge that is pervasive across our communities, and particularly acute in southwest Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a few days ago Cornell University reached a $60 million deal with the Trump administration in order to see their federal funding restored. This is the fifth such deal since the administration began this pressure campaign on universities.",
      "I know you went to University of Virginia, as did I, and must be following that UVA cut deals with the government, including kicking out the president of the school. You called that extortion. But now, as governor, are you going to have to play ball with the Department of Education and the Justice Department in order to keep federal government funding going?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: So, it should \u2013 it should shock everyone that universities, public and private, are receiving demands from the federal government and that dollars \u2013 research dollars are being withheld, that our universities are under attack. And certainly what we've seen in the case of the University of Virginia, of a popular, experienced, excellent president, was pushed out. And on the ground here we did not see our governor, in any way, step up in defense of our university.",
      "And the idea that the federal government would be withholding federal dollars, you know, including dollars already appropriated by Congress for research in order to compel universities to take certain actions, it is absolute federal government overreach. And as governor, I will be clear- eyed about ensuring that we have structures in place, including boards of visitors across our universities, that want to defend academic freedom and, frankly, the viability and vitality of extraordinary institutions, like the University of Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your party. In 2020, when Democrats lost House seats, you said \"we need to not ever use the word socialist or socialism ever again.\" There are some who look to Tuesday's win in New York City of a Democratic socialist and say that your party's actually being rewarded for echoing progressive policies. Does that victory create a branding problem for Democrats?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, you know, I'm excited about what we did here in Virginia on Tuesday in \u2013 I campaigned addressing \u2013 wanting to address the issues of costs and stopping the chaos. I'm a capitalist. I'm a Democrat. And I won by 15 points in Virginia. You look to New Jersey, and a similar story in Mikie Sherrill's win, now the governor- elect there.",
      "And so I think, you know, certainly we're a big tent party, but when I look at what led to the success that we had here and the \u2013 you know, the mandate for real governance here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was based on what I campaigned on, the efforts to really address the challenges that people are facing in a day-to-day basis. And \u2013 and now it's on us to deliver and prove that really truly the mandate that we have to work on lowering costs and strengthening our schools and keeping our communities safe and creating steady leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia particularly in light of the chaos coming out of Washington, that not only was it a winning message, but the winning path towards governance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time this morning, Governor- elect Abigail Spanberger, the \u2013 who will be the first female governor ever of the state of Virginia.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we spoke with one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey's Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress, and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL (D-NJ): Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight because we see in the market costs going up by 175 percent if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the one big, beautiful bill to people's access to health care.",
      "And, you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So, there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally. And courts are holding him accountable.",
      "We see with air traffic control problems, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So, we're already down by 25 percent. Now, with this crisis going on, because the president refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10 percent in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights.",
      "So, it's time that the government \u2013 that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate get serious about opening up government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy. And you can't justify the damage, which is why the president and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open. And they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people.",
      "I think what we saw with this election is the American people need \u2013 you know, are really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you, I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs. But also that I'm going to continue to fight that \u2013 for Washington to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs on everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the one big beautiful bill, which is continuing to raise costs on education, innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short-term funding bill. And over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, \"it shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making represent payments, trying to borrow.\" He said Dems view this as leverage. And he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying, that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have.",
      "How do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House, they've even \u2013 many would day, including myself, taken over the court system, then they have a responsibility to open up this government. And I have to tell you, as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it was \u2013 it was with Clark who said those votes are leverage.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Leverage to serve the American people. I mean we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care \u2013 look, if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175 percent for people here in New Jersey at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care. That's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the one big beautiful bill, on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in, which is raising gas prices.",
      "So, again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people. And these Republicans have got to come to the table and they've got to start really working for the American people. And this election showed that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people. And Republicans again and again are refusing to address that. So, right now this is part of how we get the government open. And they should do it right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the \u2013 Leader Thune said he'll hold a vote.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people. We can drive down health care costs. And that's really key.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19 percent over the past year versus six percent nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months. And I, you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate pair. And we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people.",
      "So, the utility companies have already come to the table so say, OK, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BP (ph) view (ph) to defray the costs. But what's really going to also happen is very quickly I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the costs of electricity we have to buy on the market. So, that's why immediately I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage. And then, in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities and, in the long term, nuclear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that \"there's a feeling working people have not been heard\" and that \"there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today.\" What did you mean by that?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: That as I was talking to people across this state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down. And something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter, I'm not doing a ten-year plan, I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency. Not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing. But it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey so that they know that this is a day one issue for me.",
      "They also want to see somebody, though, that has their backs because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the one big, beautiful bill is going to take away their health care. They know that a tax on the Gateway Tunnel project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So, they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging in particular women who fear the impact on children.",
      "What do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that, that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, we worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge somehow for me and for people across the state as we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, et cetera. But it is a scary time.",
      "I remember, right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place. And here I have four kids and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: But, you know, what I think most of us are weighing is, as moms, if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think, people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races and also some of the great powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So, I don't think it's dissuading them. But it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next governor of New Jersey.",
      "Thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Republican governor of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who joins us from Charleston.",
      "Good morning to you, sir.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY (R-WV): Hey, good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, nearly 16 percent of residents rely on food stamps, that SNAP program we've been talking about. In fact, the very first food stamp pilot program began in West Virginia back in the 1960s.",
      "Given the current shutdown and how rural your state is, I wonder, are you able to get help to those who need it right now?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Absolutely. Look, great question. I do want to start out, first of all, thanking you for having me on the program.",
      "One piece of information coming out of West Virginia, we've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner. I just want to say, that our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that miner. We're doing everything we can to locate that person.",
      "Now, when it comes to the government shutdown, we're doing everything we can to help those in need. At the very beginning, I started standing up for the federal workers, and we announced that to address some of the concerns with food, we were going to send significant dollars to the food banks by tomorrow. That will be up to $13 million. I've activated the National Guard. And we're doing things to make sure that no one in West Virginia goes hungry.",
      "Our people are hurting right now, and I'm doing everything I can to solve the problems while Washington bickers. But I do want to be clear, this shutdown could come to an end right away. It's up to Chuck Schumer or just having six more Democrats step across the line.",
      "There's been a clean CR on the table available for some time. People should take advantage of that and let's get the government reopened and then we can go about the business of fixing the many other problems facing our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I'm sorry to hear about the mining accident.",
      "But on the issue of food stamps, Governor Moore of Maryland said that he had been told the state would be punished essentially for fronting the money. Is that the message the federal government also gave to you, West Virginia won't get those dollars back?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: No. Well, first of all, I want to emphasize, the Trump administration has been a great partner to work with throughout the past year in terms of the economic progress that we're making here in West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: But also we've reached out \u2013 I was the first person to reach out to the federal government. So we had our national parks reopened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: And now we're working, by activating the Guard, and putting resources at the food banks. We're actually making a difference to keep people from getting hungry.",
      "So, we've been in very close contact with the Trump administration. And they've been very cooperative.",
      "Look, I think they know, and everyone's frustrated, that you're six votes short. These Democrats are saying no to reopening the government. It's a Schumer shutdown. I think President Trump is bending over backwards to be helpful, and I'm excited about the things he's doing in terms of how he's handling this and the broader economic issues at large.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there is the fight in the courts specifically about providing full food aid. The Trump administration initiated that. I want to play something for you because 70 percent of West Virginians voted for President Trump in the last election.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But here's how he described the food stamp program.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, (President of the United States): Largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm president. I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you made the White House aware of the pain from the food SNAP \u2013 the food program disruptions specifically?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Yes. So, we've been working closely with the White House. And I think they know. They've been very supportive of a lot of the efforts that we're taking to make sure that people don't get hungry. That's the ultimate goal. We have to make sure we're protecting our people.",
      "Margaret, you're right, we have 270,000 plus people on SNAP. But, once again, there's one reason why they're not getting the resources. It's because people are insisting to add all these new pieces on top of just a bill (ph) to keep the government open. That's the concern we have.",
      "But we've been getting really good response from the Trump administration across the board.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Whether we're talking about the food issues, whether we're talking about our energy jobs or even just recently the conversations we're having about President Trump's rural health transformation bill to put resources upfront to save public expenditures at the back end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: That's the kind of good working relationship we've had.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that because I know West Virginia has one of the highest rates in the country for government insurance. There's concern about rural hospitals. There is this rural health transformation program Congress set up. Your state could get $100 million a year for five years, but your West Virginia Hospital Association says that your hospitals are going to lose more than $1 billion per year because of this latest big, beautiful bill Republicans passed. How do you make up that kind of shortfall?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Well, I think what President Trump and RFK and Dr. Oz are trying to do is common sense. If you subscribe to the adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, what they're trying to do is invest the single largest amount of money in improving rural health. And in West Virginia, that means everything because we're a very rural state.",
      "So, the resources can go to invest in our people, to invest in our hospitals, our providers, and the technology that actually could move the needle in terms of improving health care outcomes upfront.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Attacking obesity and COPD and substance use disorder.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: So, we're really excited about that because if we apply the resources the right way, I don't think we're going to have the diminution of public expenditures at the back end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: This is the common-sense approach we're seeing from the Trump administration that we're not seeing from Schumer and the Democrats in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right.",
      "Governor, we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States Marine Corps will mark its 250th birthday tomorrow. And Veterans Day is Tuesday.",
      "For many veterans, the end of their military service is not the end of their public service. More than 700,000 veterans work as civilians in the federal government. And due to the shutdown, most are furloughed or have been working without pay for weeks.",
      "Unlike veterans, active-duty service members have been getting paid during the shutdown, but even that lifeline will expire Saturday. And some context, many military families already struggle with a growing number forced to seek assistance from food pantries over the last few years amid high prices and mounting economic pressure.",
      "That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with New Jersey Gov.-elect , a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Friday we spoke to one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress \u2013 and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown, she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended.",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight, because we see in the market, costs going up by 175% if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the One Big, Beautiful Bill to people's access to health care. And you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally, and courts are holding him accountable. We see with air traffic control problem, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So we're already down by 25%. Now, with this crisis going on because the President refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10% in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights. So, it's time that the government- that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate, get serious about opening up government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy, and you can't justify the damage, which is why the President and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open, and they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people. I think what we saw with this election is the American people, you know, really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs, but also that I'm going to continue to fight that- for Washington, to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs and everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which is continuing to raise costs on education and innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short term funding bill, and over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, It shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making rent payments, trying to borrow. He said, Dems view this as leverage, and he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have. How do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House. They've even, many would say- including myself, taken over the court system. Then they have a responsibility to open up this government, and I have to tell you as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is \u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was Whip Clark who said those votes are leverage.",
      "REP. SHERRILL: We're- leverage to serve the American people. I mean, we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care. Look, if if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175% for people here in New Jersey, at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care that's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in now, which is raising gas prices. So again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people, and these Republicans have got to come to the table, and they've got to start really working for the American people, and this election showed that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: So we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people, and Republicans, again and again, are refusing to address that. So right now--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the leader Thune said they'll hold a vote--",
      "REP. SHERRILL:\u00a0 --part of how we get the government open and they should do it right now, I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people, we can drive down health care costs, and that's really key.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular, you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19% over the past year, versus 6% nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: So the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes, because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months, and I- you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate payer, and we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people. So the utility companies have already come to the table to say, okay, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BPU to defray the cost. But what's really going to also happen is, very quickly, I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons, and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the cost of elect- of electricity we have to buy on the market. So that's why, immediately, I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage, and then in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities, and in the long term, nuclear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that there's a feeling working people have not been heard, and that there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today. What? What did you mean by that?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: That- as I was talking to people across the state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down, and something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter. I'm not doing a 10 year plan. I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency, not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that the costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing, but it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey, so that they know that this is a day one issue for me. They also want to see somebody though that has their backs, because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is going to take away their health care. They know that attacks on the Gateway Tunnel Project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus, Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging- in particular women who fear the impact on children. What do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, we've worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and- and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge issue for me and for people across the state. As we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc., but it is a scary time. I remember right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place, and here I have four kids, and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running? But you know what? I think most of us are weighing as moms if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races, and also some of the great, powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So I don't think it's dissuading them, but it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next Governor of New Jersey. Thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Democratic governor elect of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, she joins us this morning from Glen Allen, just outside of Richmond. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Virginia boasts one of the highest numbers of federal workers in the country, and as you know, many of them are not getting paid. You know, some in your party look at your election on Tuesday and the win in New Jersey and say that is permission to hold the line in Congress and refuse to fund the government or fold on the shutdown. Should congressional Democrats view your victory that way?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Absolutely not. Our victory was a victory that was based on a campaign that was addressing concerns related to costs and chaos. My campaign across the past two years have been focused on hearing the challenges that people are facing all across Virginia. It's rising costs in health care, housing, energy, and it's the chaos coming out of Washington that has been impacting Virginians so severely, beginning with the DOGE efforts, of course, continuing with chaotic trade policies, and now in this government shutdown. Virginians need to and Virginians want to see the government reopen, and my expectation is that we will see a congress, a Senate, and ultimately a president, driving us in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should congressional Democrats open the government and then talk about health care?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The government needs to open and it needs to open immediately. We need the president to demonstrate leadership, bringing people together, endeavoring to get through whatever negotiations need to get through, whether it's before or after. My priority is the, is focusing on the needs and the, the devastation, frankly, that more than 300,000 Virginians are facing. And that's just the federal employees, government contractors, they will never get made whole. The entirety of Virginia's economy is impacted by the shutdown, just as we've been impacted by Doge attacks, and the government needs to reopen quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why I'm asking, because there are what, 825,000 enrollees on food aid in the SNAP program. They're in limbo right now. You have immediate pain, so at what point do you weigh that against the potential of health care premiums? I mean, this pain is very real and very acute for people in your state right now.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And it's been going on now for weeks, weeks too long the government needs to reopen because in addition to the pain that we are already seeing\u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "But eight Democrats could cross the aisle and do so.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We absolutely need everyone to vote to open the government. And that's not to say that the challenges we're facing within our health care system are not also immediate and acute. Even the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill will have catastrophic impacts on Virginia, taking $26 billion out of our health care, leading to the closure of at least six rural hospitals. We've already seen three rural clinics announce their closure. Hundreds of 1000s will lose their Medicaid, and so the impacts on health care are already catastrophic. We cannot compound that pain by keeping the government closed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's take a break and finish this on the other side of it. Please stay with us.",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We return to our conversation with Virginia Governor elect Abigail Spanberger. Governor-elect, artificial intelligence has created a really big demand for these data centers, and Virginia has the world's largest concentration of them. Power bills are up nearly 7% in your state over the past year. Is that driven by the AI boom? And if so, how do you offset those rising energy costs?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, what we've seen in the, in the research so far is that it is not, the increased costs are not driven by the increase in data centers. There's some bad energy policies in some of our neighboring states that have driven up prices, particularly in southwest Virginia. But looking towards the future, we have to be clear eyed about the fact that we will have an energy crisis headed into the future. And so here on the ground in Virginia, we currently have a rate case where it will be important that large scale energy users, particularly data centers, that the public, know that they are paying their fair share for the energy that they are using. And we have to increase our energy production here at home so that we can meet the demand, certainly of larger scale energy users, but, but also of increased demand from, from our communities. And it is a real challenge that we have to get ahead of. And that's why among the first affordability plans that I laid out was one focused on energy. It's a challenge that is pervasive across our communities and particularly acute in southwest Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a few days ago, Cornell University reached a $60 million deal with the Trump administration in order to see their federal funding restored. This is the fifth such deal since the administration began this pressure campaign on universities. I know you went to University of Virginia, as did I, and must be following that. UVA cut deals with the government, including kicking out the president of the school. You called that extortion. But now, as governor, are you going to have to play ball with the Department of Education and the Justice Department in order to keep federal government funding going?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: So it should, It should shock everyone that universities, public and private, are receiving demands from the federal government and that dollars, research dollars, are being withheld, that our universities are under attack. And certainly what we've seen in the case the University of Virginia, a popular, experienced, excellent president was pushed out, and on the ground here, we did not see our governor in any way step up in defense of our university. And the idea that the federal government would be withholding federal dollars, including dollars already appropriated by Congress for research, in order to compel universities to take certain actions, it is absolute federal government overreach, and as governor, I will be clear eyed about ensuring that we have structures in place, including boards of visitors across our universities that want to defend academic freedom and frankly, the viability and vitality of extraordinary institutions like the University of Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your party. In 2020 when Democrats lost House seats, you said we need to not ever use the word socialist or socialism ever again. There are some who look to Tuesday's win in New York City of a Democratic socialist and say that your, your party is actually being rewarded for echoing progressive policies. Does that victory create a branding problem for Democrats?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, you know, I'm excited about what we did here in Virginia on Tuesday. I campaigned addressing, wanting to address the issues of costs and stopping the chaos. I'm a capitalist, I'm a Democrat, and I won by 15 points in Virginia. You look to New Jersey, and a similar story in Mikie Sherrill's win now the governor elect there. And so I think, you know, certainly, we're a big tent party, but when I look at what led to the success that we had here, and the, you know, the mandate for real governance here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was based on what I campaigned on, the efforts to really address the challenges that people are facing in a day to day basis. And now it's on us to deliver and prove that that really truly the the mandate that we have to work on lowering costs and strengthening our schools and keeping our communities safe and and creating steady leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly in light of the chaos coming out of Washington, that not only was it a winning message, but the winning path towards governance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time this morning, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, the, who will be the first female governor ever of the state of Virginia. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore. Good to have you here in person.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Great to be with you. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid. Since the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food?",
      "GOV. MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting. It is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they are, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid. And I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the President of the United States to finally do his job. We are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts. The USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all, what's the federal government telling you?",
      "GOV. MOORE: There is no clarity- clarity at all. In the past- in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it. Where initially it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help, to support and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people, and then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be okay--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You are fronting the money?--",
      "GOV. MOORE: -- That we are going to front the money. We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money. There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars, they got money for ballrooms, they got money for everything, but when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those- those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money. But on- on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself. On Friday, we did see the Democratic Leader Schumer offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies. Republicans said that's a- that's a nonstarter. This is going to make this a big issue for the midterms. But would you- would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in? That the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end, for an extension of a tax credit?",
      "GOV. MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, DC.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland. We have over 260,000 federal workers within our state. That even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country. But I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90%, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar- there's a- there's a- there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump you know- the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate. They can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government. Why isn't that good enough? Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to- to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care. That when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia, and I'm proud to serve as the as the- as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional- Regional Commission where we're serving Appalachia all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say yes, it's okay, if you just watch my health care go away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up, even in the private market, for a lot of different reasons. But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland. This past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50. 64% of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats. This is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: --this is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this- go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland. I'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state?",
      "GOV. MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process. It's the reason that I put together this commission where my job is not to draw the maps, that- what we've just simply said is I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to. That's not the way this process is going to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your State Senate President, Democrat Bill Ferguson says this could backfire. He wrote, 'I believe mid cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately, democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration.' How do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this Commission provides to you?",
      "GOV. MOORE: No, I think the commission of what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps, and frankly, it's a state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate President and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in. He agrees on the fact that we have watched a administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply- and where we- where we differ, is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires. And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more 'Face the Nation.' So, stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin this morning with the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. This is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to US troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Right, I think that- that's about the right number. And the problem is that under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties. And so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules--",
      "HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open. I mean, the fact is Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5% off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays. And one of these things every now and then when we're talking economics, you and I, we talk about seasonal adjustments and things like that. But the fact is that Thanksgiving, that Thanksgiving time, is one of the hottest times of the year for the economy. It's Black Friday, you know, and all that kind of stuff. And if people aren't traveling at that moment, then we really could be looking at a negative quarter for the fourth quarter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is significantly disruptive to the president's agenda. But to the point you were just making about food stamps, and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA. But why not do this as a short term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food?",
      "HASSETT: Well, the president's job, and all of our jobs, is to uphold the law. And when- I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us--",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are--",
      "HASSETT: what we can do--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that wasn't done with the military.",
      "HASSETT: But, but, but yeah, I think that the military is different because of the commander-in-chief stuff. But the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book, and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes. Which you know, you know about- in the season of lawfare, if you are a cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits?",
      "HASSETT: Let's just say that we've seen Democrats--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --if, if Congress is going to fund it, when the shut- shutdown ends?",
      "HASSETT: We- we've seen Democrats take to court people that- on really, really poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point.",
      "HASSETT: Well, we, we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid, 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now. I know you're talking to the Governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the healthcare premiums, but do that through regular order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about healthcare. But the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said, I'm recommended- to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad healthcare provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own much better healthcare. He also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about healthcare right now.",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an off--",
      "HASSETT: --And this is- you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open. And one of the things you could do is conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And you know, everybody believes that people should have healthcare, and so why not take the people who have higher healthcare premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide? The reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance, and it could be that people would rather have the money and go from like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit. And so that's, that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal?",
      "HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy- I haven't talked to him about it yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept--",
      "HASSETT: --The president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --this proposal?--",
      "HASSETT: -- the president started this idea yesterday, I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president--",
      "HASSETT: It's the weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The Senate's in session this weekend--",
      "HASSETT: --Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend and we are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: because they're trying to end the shutdown--",
      "HASSETT: --And here I am.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position.",
      "HASSETT: As of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open.",
      "HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on healthcare, that healthcare costs are too high.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I think that if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they're worried about the budgetary costs. And so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team would be about 120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases. And I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing- again most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability, and our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38%, the lowest of this term. 75% of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices, but the president said this week Democrats are making it up and quote, \"every price is down.\" I'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3%, in September from a year ago.",
      "HASSETT: --well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you dispute that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, actually, let's go through the facts, right? Inflation went up about 5% under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7%. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices--",
      "HASSETT: --No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --but depends on which--",
      "HASSETT: Let me-- I'll just make a point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "HASSETT: That if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000 because we had up to 9% inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying. The real spending power, adjusted for inflation, under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year. $1,200 is not $3,000, and so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the positive things about the economy, industrial production just about at an all time high, capital spending about at an all time high, GDP growth right now about 4%, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening. And the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected, and it would have been even lower because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming, but we understand 100% why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3% inflation?",
      "HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2% inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no, you're not happy where things are now.",
      "HASSETT: Well, they got to go down a little bit more, but there- but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say, so when you go from almost 4% that we had in January down to the mid twos, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half a percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices?",
      "HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two tenths and five tenths. And the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. It would be a one time level adjust. Our estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs. Because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff, and there's a tariff, so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the US.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here. Of course, we have to leave it there for now. We'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday froze, for now, a lower court order that required the Trump administration to swiftly provide full federal food benefits to roughly 42 million Americans.",
      "The order from Jackson is temporary. She said it will give a federal appeals court more time to consider whether to provide the Trump administration with longer emergency relief while an appeal in the dispute over payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program moves forward.",
      "The Supreme Court's late-stage intervention came as the Trump administration closed in on an end-of-day deadline, set by a district court judge Thursday, to cover in full food assistance for November and use roughly $4 billion for other nutrition programs to do so. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit had temporarily left in place the lower court's decision, after which the Justice Department sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "Jackson wrote in a brief order that her administrative stay will \"facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution\" of the Trump administration's request for the longer pause of the district court's decision. She said the appeals court should resolve the pending motion \"with dispatch.\"",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it has already exhausted the entirety of a more than $5 billion contingency reserve, which was enough to provide only partial food assistance payments for the month. It warned that the additional $4 billion needed to cover the full allotments for low-income Americans would require it to dip into a fund designated for Child Nutrition Programs.",
      "\"Pulling billions of dollars from the Child Nutrition Programs would jeopardize those programs' ability to fully operate this year \u2014 putting at risk critical food-assistance initiatives relied upon by millions of children every day, and raiding a program that Congress did fund to instead extend one that Congress has not funded,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "A USDA official notified states earlier Friday that it was working to comply with the district court's order to provide in-full the food benefits to Americans enrolled in SNAP.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision is the latest development in the legal battle over SNAP benefits that has unfolded over the past several days. The payments are used by recipients to purchase groceries, but the USDA said late last month that assistance for November would not go out because of the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "A group of cities and nonprofit organizations sued the USDA last week amid rising concerns that the lapse in payments would leave millions of low-income Americans hungry. U.S. District Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case, then ordered the Trump administration to dip into a contingency fund to provide food aid to the roughly 42 million Americans enrolled in the program for November.",
      "The administration told the court Monday that it would comply with that order but said there was only enough reserve money to provide partial SNAP benefits. The USDA sent states the information needed to calculate the reduced payments to eligible Americans on Tuesday, but warned it could be weeks before the assistance reaches recipients.",
      "The plaintiffs then asked McConnell for additional relief that would require the Trump administration to make full SNAP payments \"immediately.\"",
      "In a decision Thursday, McConnell accused the government of undermining the \"intent and the effectiveness\" of his earlier order to distribute the aid to SNAP beneficiaries as soon as possible. He pointed to a social media post from President Trump on Tuesday, in which the president said benefits would be given \"only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Amid confusion as to whether the president was signaling the administration would not follow McConnell's initial order to use the contingency funds, the White House clarified that it is complying with it.",
      "Still, the judge said the Trump administration had to provide the full SNAP payments and pull from two sources \u2014 the contingency fund and a different pot \u2014 to do so. McConnell said comments from administration officials indicate that food benefits are being withheld for \"political purposes.\"",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the 1st Circuit, the Justice Department claimed that the judge's order \"makes a mockery of the separation of powers\" and directed the USDA to find $4 billion \"in the metaphorical couch cushions.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said there was $4.6 billion available in the contingency fund to cover a partial allotment for November, and would need $9 billion to provide the full amount of SNAP benefits.",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing that the judge's order to transfer funds from the second source of money would require it to divert billions from Child Nutrition Programs, which provide food assistance benefits to millions of children.",
      "\"Unfortunately, by injecting itself with its erroneous short-term solution, the district court has scrambled ongoing political negotiations, extending the shutdown and thus undercutting its own objective of ensuring adequate funding for SNAP and all other crucial safety-net programs,\" they said.",
      "In the filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said that if left in place, McConnell's decision \"will metastasize and sow further shutdown chaos.\"",
      "\"To comply with yesterday's abrupt TRO, the government must transfer billions of dollars to SNAP and send that money to the States by tonight,\" he wrote. \"Once those billions are out the door, there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds \u2014 to the significant detriment of those other critical social programs whose budgets the district court ordered the government to raid.\"",
      "But lawyers for the cities and nonprofits claimed\u00a0to the appeals court that Trump administration officials \"callously disregard\" the harm to them and millions of Americans if assistance is provided below the full level.",
      "They urged the 1st Circuit to not let the Trump administration \"further delay getting vital food assistance to individuals and families who need it now.\"",

      "Al-Sharaa, whose rebel forces ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad late last year, is due to meet Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday.",
      "It's the first such visit by a Syrian president since the country's independence in 1946, according to analysts. Al-Sharaa addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York City in September.",
      "The interim leader met Mr. Trump for the first time in Riyadh during Mr. Trump's Middle East tour in May.",
      "U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said earlier this month that al-Sharaa would \"hopefully\" sign an agreement to join the international U.S.-led alliance against the Islamic State.",
      "The State Department's decision Friday to delist al-Sharaa as global terrorist was widely expected.",
      "State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement al-Sharaa's government had been meeting U.S. demands including on working to find missing Americans and on eliminating any remaining chemical weapons.",
      "\"These actions are being taken in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership after the departure of Bashar al-Assad and more than 50 years of repression under the Assad regime,\" Pigott said.",
      "The spokesman added that the U.S. delisting would promote \"regional security and stability as well as an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process.\"",
      "Al-Sharaa joined al Qaeda about 20 years ago, and was arrested in Iraq in 2005. He spent six years in American and Iraqi prisons before his release in 2011. He then led an affiliate of al Qaeda in Syria, and was designated as a terrorist by the U.S. in 2013. In 2016, he renounced his allegiance to al Qaeda.",
      "In November 2024, al-Sharaa led opposition forces in a stunning offensive that toppled the Assad regime.",
      "In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last month in Syria, al-Sharaa said that \"there are entire generations\" of Syrians \"that have suffered tremendous psychological trauma\" under the Assad regime.",

    "story": [
      "The White House said Saturday it would be \"beautiful\" to name the new stadium for Washington's NFL team after President Trump following an ESPN report that an intermediary has told the Commanders' ownership group that he wants it to bear his name.",
      "Mr. Trump could deliver the message in person on Sunday when he is expected to watch the Commanders play the Detroit Lions at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland. American veterans are scheduled to be honored at halftime.",
      "\"That would surely be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible,\" said Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for the Republican president.",
      "A spokesperson for the Washington Commanders told The Associated Press in a text message that the team had no comment on the report. The office of the city's mayor, Democrat Muriel Bowser, declined comment.",
      "Under a deal announced in April between the team and the District of Columbia, the team will return to the nation's capital in a new stadium expected to cost nearly $4 billion. It will be built on the site of the RFK Stadium, where the team played for more than three decades when it won three Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s. The team moved to Landover in 1997.",
      "President Joe Biden signed a bill late last year to transfer land, which included that old stadium, from the federal government to the city. While the stadium is located on federal land, the city was given permission by Congress in January to control the property for 99 years.",
      "The deal, with the team contributing $2.7 billion and the city investing roughly $1.1 billion for the stadium, housing, green space and a sports complex on land bordering the Anacostia River, was approved by the D.C. City Council in September, and demolition has begun.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump threatened to hold up the deal by insisting that the team change its name from the Commanders back to the Redskins, a name that was considered offensive to Native Americans. Despite the threat, the city council and the team were able to reach the framework of a deal a few days later.",
      "\"The Washington \"Whatever's\" should IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a July 20 social media post.",
      "\"OWNERS, GET IT DONE!!!\" the president added.",
      "The team changed its name to the Commanders in 2020 under then-owner Dan Snyder, who sold the team in 2023 to a group led by Philadelphia 76ers owner Josh Harris.",
      "Mr. Trump has long enjoyed having his name appear on things from his career as a real estate developer, from high-rise buildings, hotels and golf courses to his branding deals that have seen Trump-emblazoned Bibles, watches and cologne.",

    "story": [
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss a mortgage fraud case against her, calling it a vindictive and politically motivated prosecution brought at the behest of a president who regards her as an enemy.",
      "The motion, which had been expected, argues the case against James was driven by personal \"animus\" that arose out of James' civil fraud lawsuit against President Trump and his companies in her capacity as state attorney general.",
      "\"This lawsuit, and AG James' outspoken criticism of the President, triggered six years of targeted attacks. President Trump and his allies have used every insulting term in their vocabulary to deride AG James and call for criminal penalties in retaliation for the exercise of her rights and fulfillment of her statutory duties to fulfill her obligations as New York state's attorney general,\" lawyers for James wrote in urging that the case be dismissed.",
      "The name-calling by Mr. Trump includes describing her as \"crooked,\" \"scum,\" \"a monster\" and \"criminal,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing is similar to one from another of Mr. Trump's perceived adversaries, former FBI Director James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress. Comey has said the case against him is similarly vindictive and inspired by the president's desire for retribution.",
      "James is accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, Virginia, where she has family. She pleaded not guilty last month, and told reporters outside the courthouse that the Trump administration was using the justice system as a \"tool of revenge.\"",
      "To bolster their claim of a vindictive prosecution, James' attorneys also assert that the Justice Department has singled her out for scrutiny \"while ignoring apparent inconsistencies in the mortgage records of numerous other public officials.\"",
      "They say the activities that form the basis of the indictment match the alleged conduct of other high-profile figures who have not been investigated or charged, including Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was accused of identifying three houses as his first home.",
      "\"The only meaningful difference between AG James and these individuals is that AG James is a Democratic Attorney General who spoke out against the President, while the others are his allies and cabinet members,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "Like Comey, she was charged in Virginia by a hastily appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who was named to the post by Mr. Trump after the resignation of former acting U.S. attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "After Siebert's resignation, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote that the administration \"can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" adding: \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "Friday's court filing criticized Halligan's ascension to the job, writing that \"the President removed what he viewed as the final roadblock to his plan\u2014interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert\u2014and installed his own lawyer, Ms. Halligan, with the singular mission of churning out indictments against his political enemies. Ms. Halligan promptly obeyed.\"",
      "Comey and James are separately challenging their indictments on the grounds that Halligan was illegally named to her job.",
      "James was first elected in 2018 as New York state's top lawyer, after holding elected jobs in New York City. She is the first woman elected as the state's attorney general.",
      "James has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump's, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Mr. Trump had committed fraud. Mr. Trump has denied all allegations against him.",

    "story": [
      "Congressional Democrats have written at least eight letters seeking information about President Trump's $300 million ballroom project. So far, those oversight requests have yielded few substantive responses from the administration and a nonprofit involved in the project.",
      "The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, received no response to his letter seeking architectural plans, budgets and a donor list, according to committee staffers.",

In a letter to the National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall, Warren requested the \"source and amount of any donations or pledges\" and questioned the ballooning cost of the project.",
      "Catherine Townsend, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, responded to Warren in a letter, explaining that the Trust \"is managing the private donations gifted to support the project,\" but it's not involved in the ballroom's planning or design.",
      "Townsend said the trust complies with federal nonprofit laws but \"donor names and identifying information are not subject to public disclosure\u2026and we strictly adhere to those confidentiality requirements to protect our donors' privacy.\"",
      "The National Park Service did not reply to Warren's inquiry, according to her office. Townsend referred further questions to the White House.",
      "\"If the Trust for the National Mall has become a tool for favor-seeking between billionaires and the President of the United States, the American people deserve to know,\" Warren said. \"I'll keep pushing to find out if the Trust is facilitating wink-and-nod arrangements between Trump and his billionaire ballroom donors \u2014 and what these donors are getting in return.\"",
      "Democrats lack subpoena power, so their letters amount to requests for information. The White House may volunteer information in response, but it's under no legal obligation to comply. It was not immediately clear whether the government shutdown has impacted the White House's ability to respond to congressional outreach.",

    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is nominating Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator after all.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved Isaacman's nomination in late April and a vote by the full Senate had been expected when Mr. Trump announced he was yanking the nomination.",

    "summary": "Researcher Matthew Graham said scientists didn't initially \"believe the numbers about the energy\" emitting from the cosmic display.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\"At first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\" said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. The immense pull of that black hole, which is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields, gives the Milky Way its characteristic swirl.",
      "Scientists still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form.",
      "Studying such behemoths can help researchers better understand the stellar neighborhood surrounding supermassive black holes. The discovery also allows scientists \"to probe the interaction of supermassive black holes with their environments early in the universe,\" said Joseph Michail with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which didn't have a role in the new study. Those early interactions created the cosmos humans now call home.",
      "The oldest black hole yet discovered was spotted by scientists in March 2024. That supermassive black hole was formed when our 13.8 billion-year-old universe was just 430 million years old. The black hole is at the center of a distant galaxy and is vigorously growing, researchers said.",
      "Another ancient supermassive black hole was discovered\u00a0by NASA researchers in 2023. That one was formed about 13.2 billion years ago, making it about 40 million years older than the one found in 2024. It is about 10 times bigger than the Milky Way's black hole.",

      "Apple accuses the EU of having an \"enforcement agenda\" that seeks to \"undermine the security and privacy of iOS and iPadOS.\"",
      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",
      "In its new letter, Apple says the European Commission sent an inquiry in October that questioned whether the tech company had put in place measures to ensure a high level of safety for minors, under the Digital Services Act.",
      "Apple fired back that the EU's other major law \u2014 the Digital Markets Act \u2014 required it to allow developers to link out of their apps to websites and other apps \"with no meaningful guardrails.\"",
      "\"This exposes users to fraud and scams on those third-party platforms that we cannot control or even monitor\u2014even for apps distributed through the App Store,\" the letter says.",

      "The European Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "American tech giants like Apple, Meta and Google have faced scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators accusing them of stifling competition.",
      "Beyond the fines in Europe, U.S. officials sued Apple last year, alleging the company has violated federal antitrust laws by imposing \"shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines.\" And Apple has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, over App Store fees and policies.",
      "Apple has long argued that its App Store restrictions are necessary to protect users from privacy, viruses and scams, and the EU's new rules could expose users to security issues.",

      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",

      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha.

    "summary": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, announced last week the creation of a commission to look at mid-decade redistricting.",
    "story": [
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday defended the creation of a redistricting committee to edge out the single Republican-held seat in his state, saying he's \"not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.\"",
      "\"I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"That's not the way this process is going to work.\"",
      "Last week, Moore announced he had formed a commission to explore mid-decade redistricting in the state, following the lead of President Trump's push to redraw districts in GOP-led states Texas, Missouri and North Carolina to net more seats for Republicans.",
      "While Democrats initially decried Mr. Trump's efforts as an attempt to create an unfair advantage for Republicans, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts to gain up to five seats for Democrats. The measure, known as Prop 50, passed Tuesday with more than 60% of the vote, and an energized Newsom held a rally in Houston on Saturday, where he said Texas had \"woke us up.\"",
      "Eight of Maryland's nine House seats are already occupied by Democrats, a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 28 points in 2024. A redistricting effort would target the single Republican-held seat in the eastern part of the state.",
      "Maryland's commission is chaired by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, a close ally of Moore's, and is comprised of Senate President Bill Ferguson, Maryland House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, former Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Raymond Morriss.",
      "Maryland law dictates congressional maps are drawn by the state Assembly, where Democrats have a supermajority. Moore would have to call a special session of the Assembly to move forward with the effort.",
      "But Ferguson, a Democrat, has opposed the redistricting effort, writing in a letter last month that \"mid-cycle redistricting for Maryland presents a reality where the legal risks are too high, the timeline for action is dangerous, the downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic, and the certainty of our existing map would be undermined.\"",
      "Ferguson said last week the Democrats' election victories \"shows we don't need to rig the system to win.\"",
      "But Moore insisted Sunday that \"fighting for democracy is never risky.\" He noted that he and Ferguson agree that there is a \"crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.\"",
      "\"Where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires,\" Moore said. \"And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: the longest government shutdown in history, and no end in sight. With each passing day, the impact of the government shutdown grows, with millions of Americans now facing major disruptions, from mass flight cancellations and delays because of staffing shortages to growing lines at food banks, as the Supreme Court lets the Trump administration withhold some money to fund food stamp benefits.",
      "Frustration is mounting, and the blame game is on.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO (D-Pennsylvania): When I see hungry people in my state who are hungry because of J.D. Vance's bull (EXPLETIVE DELETED) politics, that makes me angry.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE (R-South Dakota): Isn't that what you all have been saying? It's about leverage? This isn't leverage. This is the lives of the American people.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore and West Virginia's Republican Governor Patrick Morrisey about how they could fill the funding gap as safety net programs hang in limbo.",
      "The president's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, will also join us. We will ask him what kind of impact this shutdown is having on our economy.",
      "Plus:",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): The whole series of pricing and costs, the groceries and everything else, it was a con job. It was a con job. Affordability, they call it. It was a con job by the Democrats.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Where the president sees a con job, Democrats see a winning message in last week's elections. We will hear from two incoming governors, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "The Senate is in session today, a rare weekend workday for lawmakers, but there is still no deal to reopen the government.",
      "We begin this morning with the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.",
      "This is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to U.S. troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Right. I think that that's about the right number.",
      "And the problem is that, under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that, if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties.",
      "And so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really, really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open.",
      "I mean, the fact is, Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5 percent off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays.",
      "And one of these things \u2013 every now and then, when we're talking economics, you and I, we talk about seasonal adjustments and things like that. But the fact is that Thanksgiving \u2013 that Thanksgiving time is one of the hottest times of the year for the economy. It's Black Friday, you know, and all that kind of stuff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And if people aren't traveling at that moment, then we really could be looking at a negative quarter for the fourth quarter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is significantly disruptive to the president's agenda.",
      "But to the point you were just making about food stamps \u2013 and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA.",
      "But why not do this as a short-term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, the president's job and all of our jobs is to uphold the law.",
      "And when \u2013 I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, arguably\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 what we can do\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that wasn't done with the military.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But \u2013 but \u2013 but, yes, I think that the military is different because of the commander in chief stuff.",
      "But the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes, which, you know, you know about \u2013 in the season of lawfare, if you are a Cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your Cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Let's just say that we've seen Democrats take\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 if \u2013 if Congress is going to fund it, when the shutdown ends?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We've seen Democrats take to court people that \u2013 on really, really poor, poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, we \u2013 we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid; 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now.",
      "I know you're talking to the governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the health care premiums, but do that through regular order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 so, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about health care.",
      "But the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said: \"I'm recommending to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad health care provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own, much better health care.\"",
      "He also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about health care right now.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an offer?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And what he \u2013 this is \u2013 you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open.",
      "And one of the things you could do is, conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And, you know, everybody believes that people should have health care, and so why not take the people who have higher health care premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide?",
      "The reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance. And it could be that people would rather have the money and go from, like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And so that's \u2013 that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy \u2013 I haven't talked to him about it yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 this proposal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The president has \u2013 started this idea yesterday. I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's the weekend.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate's in session this weekend.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend. And we are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they're trying to end the shutdown.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And here I am.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Current \u2013 as of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on health care, that health care costs are too high?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I think that, if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they were worried about the budgetary costs.",
      "And so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team, would be about $120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases.",
      "And I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing \u2013 again, most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability.",
      "And our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38 percent, the lowest of this term; 75 percent of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices.",
      "But the president said this week Democrats are making it up and \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Every price is down.\"",
      "I'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3 percent in September from a year ago.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, but let's go through \u2013 let's go through the facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you dispute that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, let \u2013 actually, yes, let's go through the facts, right?",
      "So, inflation went up about 5 percent under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7 percent. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it depends on which item.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, let me \u2013 I will just make a point, that if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000, because we had up to 9 percent inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying.",
      "The real spending power adjusted for inflation under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year; $1,200 is not $3,000. And so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the things, the positive things, about the economy, industrial production just about at an all-time high, capital spending about at an all-time high\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 GDP growth right now about 4 percent, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening.",
      "And the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected. And it was actually \u2013 would have been even lower, because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming.",
      "But we understand 100 percent why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3 percent inflation?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2 percent inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no, you're not happy where things are now?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think \u2013 well, they have got to go down a little bit more, but there \u2013 but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say.",
      "So when you go from almost 4 percent that we had in January\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 down to the mid 2's, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half-a- percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two-tenths and five-tenths.",
      "And the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. So, it would be a one-time level adjust.",
      "Our estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is, you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs, because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there's a tariff, and so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the U.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here in person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Great to be here, of course. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there for now.",
      "We'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore.",
      "Good to have you here in person.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Great to be with you. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid.",
      "Since the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting.",
      "It is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks, that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid.",
      "And I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the president of the United States to finally do his job.",
      "We are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts.",
      "The USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments, and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all? Like, what's the federal government telling you?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no clarity \u2013 clarity at all.",
      "In the past \u2013 in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it, where, initially, it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help to support, and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people.",
      "And then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK, we have now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are fronting the money?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That we are going to front the money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money.",
      "There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos, that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars. They got money for ballrooms. They got money for everything.",
      "But when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those \u2013 those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on \u2013 on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself, on Friday, we did see the Democratic leader, Schumer, offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies.",
      "Republicans said that's a \u2013 that's a nonstarter. This is going to make \u2013 this is a big issue for the midterms. But would you \u2013 would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in, that the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end for an extension of a tax credit?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland.",
      "We have over 260,000 federal workers within our state, that, even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country.",
      "But I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90 percent, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar \u2013 there's a \u2013 there's a \u2013 there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump \u2013 you know, the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate.",
      "They can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government.",
      "Why isn't that good enough?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Why \u2013 why\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to - - to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care, that when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia \u2013 and I'm proud to serve as the as the \u2013 as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional \u2013 Regional Commission, where we're serving Appalachia, all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania.",
      "And when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say, yes, it's OK, if you just watch my health care go away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up even in the private market for a lot of different reasons.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland.",
      "This past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50; 64 percent of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats.",
      "This is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this \u2013 go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland.",
      "I'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas or than Florida or than Ohio or all these other places.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process.",
      "It's the reason that I have \u2013 I put together this commission, where my job is not to draw the maps, that what we've just simply said is, I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that, if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to, that that's not the way this process is going to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your State Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, says this could backfire.",
      "He wrote: \"I believe mid-cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short-term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration.\"",
      "How do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials. And\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this commission provides to you?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I think the commission \u2013 what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps.",
      "And, frankly, it's the state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate president and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.",
      "He agrees on the fact that we have watched an administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply \u2013 and where we \u2013 where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires.",
      "And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.",

      "Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-Virginia) (Governor-Elect): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Virginia boasts one of the highest numbers of federal workers in the country, and, as you know, many of them are not getting paid.",
      "You know, some in your party look at your election on Tuesday and the win in New Jersey and say that is permission to hold the line in Congress and refuse to fund the government or fold on the shutdown. Should congressional Democrats view your victory that way?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Absolutely not.",
      "Our victory was a victory that was based on a campaign that was addressing concerns related to costs and chaos. My campaign across the past two years had been focused on hearing the challenges that people are facing all across Virginia.",
      "It's rising costs in health care, housing, energy, and it's the chaos coming out of Washington that has been impacting Virginians so severely, beginning with the DOGE efforts, of course, continuing with chaotic trade policies, and now in this government shutdown.",
      "Virginians need to and Virginians want to see the government reopen. And my expectation is that we will see a Congress, a Senate, and ultimately a president, driving us in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should congressional Democrats open the government and then talk about health care?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The government needs to open, and it needs to open immediately.",
      "We need the president to demonstrate leadership, bringing people together, endeavoring to get through whatever negotiations need to get through, whether it's before or after. My priority is the \u2013 is focusing on the needs and the \u2013 the devastation, frankly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: \u2026 that more than 300,000 Virginians are facing.",
      "And that's just the federal employees, government contractors. They will never get made whole. The entirety of Virginia's economy is impacted by the shutdown, just as we've been impacted by DOGE attacks, and the government needs to reopen quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why I'm asking, because there are, what, 825,000 enrollees on food aid in the SNAP program. They're in limbo right now.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have immediate pain. So, at what point do you weigh that against the potential of health care premiums? I mean, this pain is very real and very acute for people in your state right now.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And it's been going on now for weeks, weeks too long. The government needs to reopen because, in addition to the pain that we are already seeing federal employees and government contractors facing\u2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But eight Democrats could cross the aisle and do so.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We absolutely need everyone to vote to open the government.",
      "And that's not to say that the challenges we're facing within our health care system are not also immediate and acute. Even the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill will have catastrophic impacts on Virginia, taking $26 billion out of our health care, leading to the closure of at least six rural hospitals.",
      "We've already seen three rural clinics announce their closure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Hundreds of thousands will lose their Medicaid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And so the impacts on health care are already catastrophic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: But we cannot compound that pain by keeping the government closed.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We return to our conversation with Virginia Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger.",
      "Governor-elect, artificial intelligence has created a really big demand for these data centers. And Virginia has the world's largest concentration of them. Power bills are up nearly seven percent in your state over the past year. Is that driven by the A.I. boom? And, if so, how do you offset those rising energy costs?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): Well, what we've seen in the \u2013 in the research so far is that it is not \u2013 the increase costs are not driven by the increase in data centers. There's, you know, some bad energy policies in some of our neighboring states that have driven up prices, particularly in southwest Virginia.",
      "But looking towards the future, we have to be clear-eyed about the fact that we will have an energy crisis headed into the future. And so here, on the ground in Virginia, we currently have a rate (ph) case where it will be important that large-scale energy users, particularly data centers, that the public know that they are paying their fair share for the energy that they are using. And we have to increase our energy production here at home so that we can meet the demand certainly of larger-scale energy users but also of increased demand from our communities.",
      "And it is a real challenge that we have to get ahead of. And that's why among the first affordability plans that I laid out was one focused on energy. It's a challenge that is pervasive across our communities, and particularly acute in southwest Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a few days ago Cornell University reached a $60 million deal with the Trump administration in order to see their federal funding restored. This is the fifth such deal since the administration began this pressure campaign on universities.",
      "I know you went to University of Virginia, as did I, and must be following that UVA cut deals with the government, including kicking out the president of the school. You called that extortion. But now, as governor, are you going to have to play ball with the Department of Education and the Justice Department in order to keep federal government funding going?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: So, it should \u2013 it should shock everyone that universities, public and private, are receiving demands from the federal government and that dollars \u2013 research dollars are being withheld, that our universities are under attack. And certainly what we've seen in the case of the University of Virginia, of a popular, experienced, excellent president, was pushed out. And on the ground here we did not see our governor, in any way, step up in defense of our university.",
      "And the idea that the federal government would be withholding federal dollars, you know, including dollars already appropriated by Congress for research in order to compel universities to take certain actions, it is absolute federal government overreach. And as governor, I will be clear- eyed about ensuring that we have structures in place, including boards of visitors across our universities, that want to defend academic freedom and, frankly, the viability and vitality of extraordinary institutions, like the University of Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your party. In 2020, when Democrats lost House seats, you said \"we need to not ever use the word socialist or socialism ever again.\" There are some who look to Tuesday's win in New York City of a Democratic socialist and say that your party's actually being rewarded for echoing progressive policies. Does that victory create a branding problem for Democrats?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, you know, I'm excited about what we did here in Virginia on Tuesday in \u2013 I campaigned addressing \u2013 wanting to address the issues of costs and stopping the chaos. I'm a capitalist. I'm a Democrat. And I won by 15 points in Virginia. You look to New Jersey, and a similar story in Mikie Sherrill's win, now the governor- elect there.",
      "And so I think, you know, certainly we're a big tent party, but when I look at what led to the success that we had here and the \u2013 you know, the mandate for real governance here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was based on what I campaigned on, the efforts to really address the challenges that people are facing in a day-to-day basis. And \u2013 and now it's on us to deliver and prove that really truly the mandate that we have to work on lowering costs and strengthening our schools and keeping our communities safe and creating steady leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia particularly in light of the chaos coming out of Washington, that not only was it a winning message, but the winning path towards governance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time this morning, Governor- elect Abigail Spanberger, the \u2013 who will be the first female governor ever of the state of Virginia.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we spoke with one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey's Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress, and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL (D-NJ): Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight because we see in the market costs going up by 175 percent if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the one big, beautiful bill to people's access to health care.",
      "And, you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So, there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally. And courts are holding him accountable.",
      "We see with air traffic control problems, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So, we're already down by 25 percent. Now, with this crisis going on, because the president refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10 percent in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights.",
      "So, it's time that the government \u2013 that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate get serious about opening up government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy. And you can't justify the damage, which is why the president and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open. And they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people.",
      "I think what we saw with this election is the American people need \u2013 you know, are really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you, I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs. But also that I'm going to continue to fight that \u2013 for Washington to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs on everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the one big beautiful bill, which is continuing to raise costs on education, innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short-term funding bill. And over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, \"it shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making represent payments, trying to borrow.\" He said Dems view this as leverage. And he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying, that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have.",
      "How do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House, they've even \u2013 many would day, including myself, taken over the court system, then they have a responsibility to open up this government. And I have to tell you, as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it was \u2013 it was with Clark who said those votes are leverage.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Leverage to serve the American people. I mean we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care \u2013 look, if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175 percent for people here in New Jersey at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care. That's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the one big beautiful bill, on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in, which is raising gas prices.",
      "So, again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people. And these Republicans have got to come to the table and they've got to start really working for the American people. And this election showed that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people. And Republicans again and again are refusing to address that. So, right now this is part of how we get the government open. And they should do it right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the \u2013 Leader Thune said he'll hold a vote.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people. We can drive down health care costs. And that's really key.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19 percent over the past year versus six percent nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months. And I, you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate pair. And we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people.",
      "So, the utility companies have already come to the table so say, OK, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BP (ph) view (ph) to defray the costs. But what's really going to also happen is very quickly I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the costs of electricity we have to buy on the market. So, that's why immediately I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage. And then, in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities and, in the long term, nuclear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that \"there's a feeling working people have not been heard\" and that \"there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today.\" What did you mean by that?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: That as I was talking to people across this state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down. And something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter, I'm not doing a ten-year plan, I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency. Not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing. But it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey so that they know that this is a day one issue for me.",
      "They also want to see somebody, though, that has their backs because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the one big, beautiful bill is going to take away their health care. They know that a tax on the Gateway Tunnel project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So, they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging in particular women who fear the impact on children.",
      "What do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that, that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did?",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, we worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge somehow for me and for people across the state as we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, et cetera. But it is a scary time.",
      "I remember, right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place. And here I have four kids and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: But, you know, what I think most of us are weighing is, as moms, if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think, people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races and also some of the great powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So, I don't think it's dissuading them. But it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next governor of New Jersey.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, nearly 16 percent of residents rely on food stamps, that SNAP program we've been talking about. In fact, the very first food stamp pilot program began in West Virginia back in the 1960s.",
      "Given the current shutdown and how rural your state is, I wonder, are you able to get help to those who need it right now?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Absolutely. Look, great question. I do want to start out, first of all, thanking you for having me on the program.",
      "One piece of information coming out of West Virginia, we've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner. I just want to say, that our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that miner. We're doing everything we can to locate that person.",
      "Now, when it comes to the government shutdown, we're doing everything we can to help those in need. At the very beginning, I started standing up for the federal workers, and we announced that to address some of the concerns with food, we were going to send significant dollars to the food banks by tomorrow. That will be up to $13 million. I've activated the National Guard. And we're doing things to make sure that no one in West Virginia goes hungry.",
      "Our people are hurting right now, and I'm doing everything I can to solve the problems while Washington bickers. But I do want to be clear, this shutdown could come to an end right away. It's up to Chuck Schumer or just having six more Democrats step across the line.",
      "There's been a clean CR on the table available for some time. People should take advantage of that and let's get the government reopened and then we can go about the business of fixing the many other problems facing our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I'm sorry to hear about the mining accident.",
      "But on the issue of food stamps, Governor Moore of Maryland said that he had been told the state would be punished essentially for fronting the money. Is that the message the federal government also gave to you, West Virginia won't get those dollars back?",

      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: But also we've reached out \u2013 I was the first person to reach out to the federal government. So we had our national parks reopened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: And now we're working, by activating the Guard, and putting resources at the food banks. We're actually making a difference to keep people from getting hungry.",
      "So, we've been in very close contact with the Trump administration. And they've been very cooperative.",
      "Look, I think they know, and everyone's frustrated, that you're six votes short. These Democrats are saying no to reopening the government. It's a Schumer shutdown. I think President Trump is bending over backwards to be helpful, and I'm excited about the things he's doing in terms of how he's handling this and the broader economic issues at large.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there is the fight in the courts specifically about providing full food aid. The Trump administration initiated that. I want to play something for you because 70 percent of West Virginians voted for President Trump in the last election.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But here's how he described the food stamp program.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, (President of the United States): Largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm president. I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you made the White House aware of the pain from the food SNAP \u2013 the food program disruptions specifically?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Yes. So, we've been working closely with the White House. And I think they know. They've been very supportive of a lot of the efforts that we're taking to make sure that people don't get hungry. That's the ultimate goal. We have to make sure we're protecting our people.",
      "Margaret, you're right, we have 270,000 plus people on SNAP. But, once again, there's one reason why they're not getting the resources. It's because people are insisting to add all these new pieces on top of just a bill (ph) to keep the government open. That's the concern we have.",
      "But we've been getting really good response from the Trump administration across the board.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Whether we're talking about the food issues, whether we're talking about our energy jobs or even just recently the conversations we're having about President Trump's rural health transformation bill to put resources upfront to save public expenditures at the back end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: That's the kind of good working relationship we've had.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that because I know West Virginia has one of the highest rates in the country for government insurance. There's concern about rural hospitals. There is this rural health transformation program Congress set up. Your state could get $100 million a year for five years, but your West Virginia Hospital Association says that your hospitals are going to lose more than $1 billion per year because of this latest big, beautiful bill Republicans passed. How do you make up that kind of shortfall?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Well, I think what President Trump and RFK and Dr. Oz are trying to do is common sense. If you subscribe to the adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, what they're trying to do is invest the single largest amount of money in improving rural health. And in West Virginia, that means everything because we're a very rural state.",
      "So, the resources can go to invest in our people, to invest in our hospitals, our providers, and the technology that actually could move the needle in terms of improving health care outcomes upfront.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Attacking obesity and COPD and substance use disorder.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: So, we're really excited about that because if we apply the resources the right way, I don't think we're going to have the diminution of public expenditures at the back end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: This is the common-sense approach we're seeing from the Trump administration that we're not seeing from Schumer and the Democrats in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right.",
      "Governor, we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States Marine Corps will mark its 250th birthday tomorrow. And Veterans Day is Tuesday.",
      "For many veterans, the end of their military service is not the end of their public service. More than 700,000 veterans work as civilians in the federal government. And due to the shutdown, most are furloughed or have been working without pay for weeks.",
      "Unlike veterans, active-duty service members have been getting paid during the shutdown, but even that lifeline will expire Saturday. And some context, many military families already struggle with a growing number forced to seek assistance from food pantries over the last few years amid high prices and mounting economic pressure.",
      "That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.",

      "Paul Tagliabue, the former NFL commissioner who led the league for 17 years, has died at the age of 84, his family confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Tagliabue died from heart failure complicated by Parkinson's disease at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, on Sunday, his family said.",
      "Tagliabue was commissioner from 1989, when he succeeded Pete Rozelle, to 2006. He was succeeded by the current commissioner, Roger Goodell.",
      "\"All of us in the NFL are deeply saddened by the passing of Paul Tagliabue, whose principled leadership and vision put the NFL on the path to unparalleled success,\" Goodell said in a statement on Sunday.",
      "He added: \"Paul was the ultimate steward of the game \u2014 tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL. I am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.\"",
      "Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league's bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages.",
      "During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise.",
      "Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the \"Rooney Rule,\" in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.",
      "When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league.",
      "Tagliabue certainly had his detractors, notably over concussions. The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma.",
      "In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn't have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions \"one of those pack-journalism issues\" and contended the number of concussions \"is relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.\"",
      "Tagliabue was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. He is survived by his wife, Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily.",

      "Having used CBD in his practice to treat pain and inflammation, Henry Han wanted to harness its full potential. It was groundbreaking science at the time, and he wanted 25-year-old Pierre Haobsh to help develop it.",

      "As it turned out, Haobsh wasn't a formally trained scientist. He didn't even have a college degree.",

      "Natalie Morales: Sounds like he was sort of \u2026 a snake oil salesman-type, right?",
      "Marla Palumbo: He was \u2014",
      "Mark Palumbo: \u00a0\u2014 sophisticated one, but yes \u2014",

      "Natalie Morales: That was the final straw.",
      "Marla Palumbo: That was Henry's final straw.",

      "But then, a few weeks before the murders, the Palumbos say Henry Han brought up Pierre Haobsh out of the blue.",
      "Marla Palumbo: Henry mentioned that he had learned a lot more about Pierre's upbringing \u2026 how much Pierre had to overcome from his childhood. \u2026 Mark nor I really responded. We didn't want to have Pierre back in our fold at all.",
      "The Palumbos were not alone in being wary of Pierre Haobsh. Jennie Han's friend, Isaiah Oregon, says Jennie also had concerns and confided in him about them four days before the murders.",

      "But Pierre Haobsh had already ingratiated himself back into Henry's good will.",

      "Isaiah Oregon: Using Henry's good nature \u2026 by lying to him, by manipulating him.",
      "Authorities learned that Haobsh had been an overnight guest at the Han's home before the murders and had formed a new partnership with the healer. There was that contract found in the master bedroom they had signed the last day of Henry's life. But Prosecutor Ben Ladinig says it didn't seem legitimate.",
      "Ben Ladinig: It \u2026 was like a college sophomore drafted it. \u2026 It was not notarized, not witnessed.",
      "Detectives had found something else of interest.",
      "Ben Ladinig: A brilliant detective \u2026 \u00a0found \u2026 packaging to \u2026 the plastic \u2026 wrapping \u2026 that all three of the Han family were wrapped in \u2026 In a trash can, in the kitchen area next to packaging \u2026 of 3M duct tape, similar to the duct tape that was used to wrap all three of the bodies.",
      "He recognized the plastic wrap was a Home Depot brand and reached out to the company's security department.",
      "Ben Ladinig: And Home Depot was, within hours of us \u2026 gaining an entry into the house, able to run those two items together, to see if they had been purchased in the Southern California region within the last several days or weeks.",
      "A Home Depot in Oceanside, California, had security footage of a man who matched the DMV photo of Pierre Haobsh, who also happened to have an Oceanside address.",
      "Ben Ladinig: And that was \"Bam!\" We knew. \u2026 He's walking out with three huge plastic rolls \u2026 and sure enough, duct tape.",
      "Natalie Morales: So within hours of \u2026 the crime scene being discovered, Pierre Haobsh became \u2026 a person of interest.",
      "Ben Ladinig: Yes.",
      "But where was Haobsh now? Detectives had a hunch. Data from the Hans' cellphones \u2014 which were missing \u2014 showed they were traveling south, further, and further from Santa Barbara.",
      "Ben Ladinig: Then inexplicably, Henry's phone goes dark \u2026 but Jennie's is still on and it keeps going south. \u2026We're getting basically digital footprints leading down to the Oceanside area from a dead woman's phone.",

      "The day after the Han family was found murdered, a manhunt was underway in Oceanside, California \u2014 nearly 200 miles from the crime scene. Sgt. Anthony Flores and his partner were part of the local Oceanside Police team assisting the Santa Barbara investigation.",
      "Sgt. Anthony Flores: We had come in to work with our Special Enforcement section \u2026 And we were gonna be the stop car for that day. \u2026 If \u2026 given a window of opportunity \u2026 to take him into custody or potentially stop him.",
      "Meanwhile, undercover detectives were conducting surveillance at the residence Pierre Haobsh shared with his father and updating all units \u2014 including the homicide team that had driven down from Santa Barbara with Prosecutor Ben Ladinig.",
      "Ben Ladinig: All of a sudden, we get chatter \u2026 on our intercoms \u2026 \"dad's on the move.\"",
      "The surveillance team followed Pierre Haobsh's father as he drove to a Walmart parking lot, where security cameras captured him meeting up with none other than Pierre.",
      "Ben Ladinig: That's dad driving in \u2026 sedan and then you see the Lexus following shortly behind \u2026 They appear to be communicating briefly together \u2026 you can just see that trunk pop \u2014 on dad's car.",
      "After transferring two large duffel bags to Pierre Haobsh's car, they both drove off.",
      "Ben Ladinig: We gotta move quickly.",
      "Sgt. Anthony Flores (driving): It was \u2026 a little after midnight and \u2026 we had just got the update that the suspect was on the move \u2026 As we're traveling, we're hearing that he's pulling into the ARCO station.",
      "Sgt. Anthony Flores: He had a few miles of a head start.",
      "The other units and Ladinig had pulled over by the ARCO station waiting for the arrest team to arrive.",
      "Ben Ladinig: Then all of a sudden, you see \u2026 an unmarked car \u2026 drive right through the middle of that intersection \u2026 sparks fly and \u2026 it just basically comes in, pulls in and lays on the brakes \u2026 Two huge dudes get outta the car and pull gun on him and prone him out. And our eyes are like saucers. We're like, whoa.",

      "Sgt. Anthony Flores: I remember it going down really fast \u2026 \u00a0all of our senses were heightened ...",
      "Within 48 hours of the murders, investigators had the Han family's alleged killer in custody. Pierre Haobsh waived his Miranda rights and started talking to detectives. What he told them was something out of a spy thriller. He claimed that his life was in danger.",
      "PIERRE HAOBSH (to detective): Over the past couple of days, I\u2014I kid you not I've been shot at. \u2026 probably about five individuals so far that I shot in self-defense.",

      "Pierre Haobsh said he had left Santa Barbara around 2 p.m. on March \u00a022 \u2014 the day before the murders \u2014 after signing the contract. But detectives pushed back.",

      "Pierre Haobsh's arrest near Oceanside, California, had come at a critical juncture. He was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun that was in plain view on the driver's side floorboard. He also had his passport and those duffel bags, which he had received from his father minutes earlier.",
      "Ben Ladinig: Two \"go bags.\" \u2026 Basically, whatever you need, clothes \u2026 everything for the person to live for months.",
      "Haobsh's father was also detained and questioned, but he was released later that morning.",
      "Ben Ladinig: We could've charged him \u2026 as an accessory, but we didn't have any indication. \u2026 that dad \u2026 was involved in any way, shape, or form in the killing \u2026",
      "The next day, during a closer examination of Haobsh's car at the crime lab, \"You name it we found it in that car,\" said Ladinig.",
      "There was Henry's wallet, credit card and Social Security number, along with an expended shell casing. There were also the victims' phones and tablet, all wrapped in aluminum foil, in an attempt to evade tracking.",
      "Ben Ladinig: And in the trunk ... you lift up where the spare tire would be \u2026 the murder weapon \u2026 suppressor silencer, ammunition.",
      "A week after the murders, the autopsies revealed the victims had been shot 14 times \u2014 three each into Henry and Jennie, and most disturbing, eight in Emily.",
      "Ben Ladinig: That ammunition \u2026 is the same stuff that we found at the crime scene, in the decedent's bodies \u2026 Match, match, match, match, match. Everything.",
      "Pierre Haobsh was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, making him eligible for the death penalty.",
      "Defense attorney Christine Voss, who was with the Public Defender's Office at the time, represented Haobsh.",
      "Christine Voss: It was one of the most challenging cases, if not the most challenging case I ever came upon. \u2026 He really wanted to be vindicated. \u2026 To me, the goal was for him to not get death.",
      "At the eleventh hour, the D.A.'s office agreed to waive the death penalty in exchange for a more expedient bench trial, which meant a judge, not a jury, would render a verdict.",
      "On Oct. 25, 2021 more than five-and-a-half years after the murders, the prosecution delivered its opening statement and laid out its theory of the case \u2014 that Pierre Haobsh had plotted the murder of the Han family for financial gain. They painted him as a career con man who up until the murders flaunted his intelligence and supposed wealth.",
      "Marla Palumbo: His entire life's drive was being rich.",
      "Ben Ladinig: He \u2026 sent \u2026 screenshots of his Chase account from anywhere from about $3 million up to $940 million dollars to various people attempting to dupe them that he's this jet setting, billionaire.",
      "Pierre Haobsh claimed he had received big offers for his energy technology.",
      "Christine Voss: I'm not a scientist, but I don't know that there's a such thing as a perpetual energy machine.",
      "But several years before the murders, Haobsh was actually being paid to build one.",
      "Samantha Spidell: It was gonna be a new source of energy as if he was, you know, an Elon Musk \u2026",
      "Samantha Spidell met Pierre Haobsh circa 2012 when he moved into a penthouse apartment in a luxury high-rise she managed in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Samantha Spidell: He \u2026 pulled up \u2026 and had this \u2026 bright red Ferrari \u2026 it was very flashy.",
      "Ladinig says Haobsh had duped a group of high-rolling investors into financing his invention, until they realized it didn't actually work.",
      "Ben Ladinig: He had basically defrauded all these people and the money dried up \u2026 When the murders were committed I think he had less than $500 to his name.",
      "Prosecutors presented a detailed timeline retracing Haobsh's movements, including his digital footprint, in the days before and after the murders. They say as early as March 17 \u2014 six days before the murders \u2014 he had looked into impersonating the doctor at his bank.",
      "Ben Ladinig: He's searching for Asian disguises and real flesh masks.",
      "Natalie Morales: Like a \"Mission Impossible\" face mask.",
      "Ben Ladinig: Right. Hundred percent. \u2026 this is his fantastical world that he lived in.",
      "There's no evidence he ever purchased a mask. But a time-stamped receipt and security video placed him at an Arizona gun store four days before the murders \u2014 purchasing ammunition and two firearms, including the alleged murder weapon.",
      "Ben Ladinig: \u00a0\u2014 a .22 pistol with a threaded barrel \u2026 for what is a silencer or suppressor \u2026",
      "On March 20, he was back in Oceanside, California, buying supplies before driving up to the Han's house under the guise of installing the energy machine. Instead, Ladinig says Pierre Haobsh bugged Henry Han's computer with a spyware app called a keylogger.",
      "Ben Ladinig: What keyloggers do is every stroke, every click of the mouse, every navigation page you go, it documents all of it.",
      "To their surprise, investigators also found the keylogger on Pierre Haobsh's laptop. On March 21, while Haobsh was still at the Han's home, the keylogger had recorded chilling search terms on his laptop.",
      "Ben Ladinig: What part of the skull is more penetrable? \u2026 What ammunition would be better ...",
      "Natalie Morales: As a guest in Dr. Han's house \u2013",
      "Ben Ladinig: A guest\u2014 he'd been staying there \u2013",
      "Natalie Morales: -- for the two nights before ... Planning, this execution-style murder.",
      "Ben Ladinig: Yes.",
      "Pierre Haobsh left the Han residence on March 22, but prosecutors allege he went back around 4 a.m. the next morning to carry out the murders. They say later that day he began frantically trying to siphon money from Henry Han's accounts.",
      "Ben Ladinig: He's using phones. \u2026 He's using fake email accounts. He's doing all these things from \u2026 personal identifying information of Dr. Han's that he stole earlier that week.",
      "A Chase fraud alert had flagged an attempted payment for $72,000. Meanwhile, Pierre Haobsh also rented that big truck he allegedly drove to the crime scene hoping to move the bodies.",
      "Ben Ladinig: There are black and whites all over that house. \u2026 The crime scene's being processed.",
      "The Palumbos say the meeting they were supposed to have with Henry Han just hours after he was murdered had foiled Pierre Haobsh's plans.",
      "Marla Palumbo: He thought \u2026 that he had that whole day to clean up his mess before Henry would be missed.",
      "Mark Palumbo: He wasn't fast enough.",
      "Marla Palumbo: I think we screwed it up for him, happily.",
      "That's when prosecutors say he fled, driving south toward Oceanside. Ladinig argues Pierre Haobsh's subsequent searches betray his guilty conscience: \"is car searched entering tijuana\"; \"How Crime Scene Investigation Works\"; and \"how long do fingerprints take to process\". Incredibly, he even consulted an online psychic named Count Marco and asked him \"will I get causght for what I did?\"",
      "Ben Ladinig: And Count Marco replies, well, what did you do, Pierre?",
      "Pierre Haobsh never gave Count Marco an explanation, but on the stand, he couldn't stop talking.",
      "Pierre Haobsh Tells an Outlandish Story on the Stand",
      "Christine Voss: This was a tough case \u2026 but that didn't change the fact that Pierre was entitled to a vigorous defense.",
      "Defense Attorney Christine Voss was in an unusual position.",
      "Christine Voss: This was a really well investigated case. \u2026 Because my client wanted to have a trial and wanted me to turn every stone, I did.",
      "Turn every stone and raise any possible reasonable doubt.",
      "Natalie Morales: You argued that there were elements presented that were implausible \u2026 unprovable and simply impossible, those were your words.",
      "Christine Voss: Yeah.",
      "Voss expressed concerns that the alleged murder weapon and silencer found in Haobsh's car didn't match up.",
      "Christine Voss: It absolutely did not connect to the firearm that they believed was the murder weapon.",
      "She seized on discrepancies in the location data from Haobsh's car and phone that the prosecution had used in its timeline.",
      "Christine Voss: He could not possibly have been in San Diego and Santa Barbara simultaneously, or Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara simultaneously. But that's what the GPS data showed.",
      "And she attacked the credibility of the prosecution's star witness, TJ Direda. Voss questioned why Direda waited nearly two days to contact authorities, and argued in that time, he could have gotten details about the crime scene that the prosecution claimed only the killer knew.",
      "Christine Voss: It was not the best kept crime scene \u2026 he was making various phone calls after he heard about the death of Dr. Han \u2026",
      "But Voss concedes much of Direda's testimony was corroborated by the evidence.",
      "Ben Ladinig: This case was over within the first 72 hours.",
      "In fact, the only witness who provided testimony that someone other than Pierre Haobsh was the killer was Pierre Haobsh. During three days on the stand, he repeated the action-packed account he'd given detectives about having shootouts with shadowy figures. Now he said he was sure they were sent by the Department of Energy.",
      "Natalie Morales:\u00a0 It sounds like there'd be a trail of bodies \u2026 But yet, is there proof of this trail of bodies anywhere to your knowledge?",
      "Christine Voss: No. \u2026 which further made him believe it was the Department of Energy \u2026",
      "And what about all that evidence investigators found?",
      "Ben Ladinig: The DOE \u2026 planted them \u2026 it's all a frame, all that stuff is framed. The banking stuff, frame job. \u2026 What's in my car, frame job.",
      "Christine Voss: It was difficult for me to embrace Pierre's testimony.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think he himself believed some of the things \u2026 he was saying were true?",
      "Christine Voss: Oh yeah, definitely.",
      "Samantha Spidell: He was obsessed with the government.",
      "Samantha Spidell attests there were some kernels of truth in his stories.",
      "Samantha Spidell: Pierre mentions that his dad had ties to the CIA \u2026 And I could tell that he \u2026 wanted his dad's \u2026 approval.",
      "When his father died in 2023, his obituary stated he was, \"a key player in clandestine Central Intelligence Agency operations during the 1980s.\" Pierre Haobsh also told Spidell that his sister was going to star in a reality TV show.",
      "Samantha Spidell: She got cast on a newlyweds reality show \u2026 and Pierre was gonna be in it \u2026 come to find out that was true.",
      "In fact, both Haobsh and his father made appearances on the second season of the Bravo TV series \"Newlyweds, The First Year.\" Pierre was even shown giving his brother-in-law a cooking lesson.",
      "But Prosecutor Ben Ladinig argued any grains of authenticity in Haobsh's life were far outweighed by deceit.",
      "Natalie Morales: You called him \"a lying liar who lies about lying.\"",
      "Ben Ladinig: \u00a0Right \u2026 Lie, lie, lie, lie hundreds of lies we found on him. \u2026 His life was a con.",
      "On Nov. 24, 2021, Judge Brian Hill would get the case. None of Pierre Haobsh's family members attended his trial. The judge made his ruling: guilty on all counts.",
      "Natalie Morales: The judge, when he issued his ruling, said \u2026 his decision was beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely no doubt of Pierre Haobsh's guilt.",
      "Ben Ladinig: Yeah \u2026 very satisfactory to hear that.",
      "Christine Voss: I wasn't surprised.",
      "Natalie Morales: And what was Pierre's reaction upon hearing that ruling?",
      "Christine Voss: Well, he was visibly disappointed.",
      "On April 15, 2022, Pierre Haobsh was sentenced to three life terms without the possibility of parole. It was little comfort to those still mourning Henry, Jennie and Emily.",
      "Don Goldberg: I don't understand how there really could be justice.",
      "Isaiah Oregon: He's still alive \u2026 and \u2014 and they're not. \u2026 \u00a0He took precious moments that \u2026 we'll never get. (wipe tears from his eyes)",
      "Marla Palumbo: I want him to feel every pain possible for what he did.",
      "Mark Palumbo: Not enough bad things can happen for him.",
      "Nearly a decade after the murders, the wounds are still raw.",
      "Isaiah Oregon: \u00a0It's hard to think of them.",
      "Dr. Glenn Miller: He was a really good man. \u2026 you don't replace a Henry Han. No.",
      "Don Goldberg: Pretty much every day I think of Henry and Jennie and Emily. \u2026 There's an old \u2026 phrase that \u2026 a good man and a good family lives for limited time, but a good name shall live forever \u2026 They lived too short \u2026 but \u2026 their name lives on forever.",
      "Haobsh's conviction was upheld by the California Court of Appeal in January 2025.",

      "In July, Mr. Trump threatened to hold up the deal by insisting that the team change its name from the Commanders back to the Redskins, a name that was considered offensive to Native Americans. Despite the threat, the city council and the team were able to reach the framework of a deal a few days later.",
      "\"The Washington \"Whatever's\" should IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a July 20 social media post.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:42:44 -0500",
    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

      "As well as the edit of Mr. Trump, the dossier criticized the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns about alleged anti-Israel bias in the BBC's Arabic service.",

      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Hey, good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country. Nearly 16% of residents rely on food stamps, that SNAP program we've been talking about. In fact, the very first food stamp pilot program began in West Virginia back in the 1960s. Given the current shutdown and how rural your state is, I wonder are you able to get help to those who need it right now?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Absolutely, look great question. I do want to start out, first of all, thank you for having me on the program. One piece of information coming out of West Virginia. We've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner. I just want to say that our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that miner. We're doing everything we can to locate that person. Now, when it comes to the government shutdown, we're doing everything we can to help those in need. At the very beginning, I started standing up for the federal workers, and we announced that, to address some of the concerns with food, we were going to send significant dollars to the food banks. By tomorrow, that'll be up to $13 million. I've activated the National Guard and we're doing things to make sure that no one in West Virginia goes hungry. Our people are hurting right now, and I'm doing everything I can to solve the problems while Washington bickers. But I do want to be clear, this shutdown could come to an end right away. It's up to Chuck Schumer or just having six more Democrats step across the line. There's been a clean CR on the table available for some time. People should take advantage of that, and let's get the government reopened and then we can go about the business of fixing the many other problems facing our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I'm sorry to hear about the mining accident. But on the issue of food stamps, Governor Moore of Maryland said that he had been told the state would be punished, essentially, for fronting the money. Is that the message the federal government also gave to you. West Virginia won't get those dollars back?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: No, well, first of all, I want to emphasize the Trump administration has been a great partner to work with throughout the past year in terms of the economic progress that we're making here in West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: But also we've reached out, I was the first person to reach out to the federal government, so we had our national parks reopened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: And now we're working by activating the guard and putting resources at the food banks. We're actually making a difference to keep people from getting hungry. So we've been in very close contact with the Trump administration, and they've been very cooperative. Look, I think they know, and everyone's frustrated, that you're six votes short. These Democrats are saying no to reopening the government. It's a Schumer shutdown. I think President Trump is bending over backwards --",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there is the fight in the courts, specifically, about providing full food aid. The Trump administration initiated that. I want to play something for you because 70% of West Virginians voted for President Trump in the last election. But here's how he described the food stamp program.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm President, I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",

MORRISEY: Yeah, so we've been working closely with the White House, and I think they know they've been very supportive of a lot of the efforts that we're taking to make sure that people don't get hungry. That's the ultimate goal. We have to make sure we're protecting our people. Margaret, you're right. We have 270,000 plus people on SNAP, but once again, there's one reason why --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- why they're not getting the resources. It's because people are insisting to add all these new pieces on top of just a bill to keep the government open. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- That's the concern we have. But we've been getting really good response from the Trump administration across the board. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- Whether we're talking about the food issues, whether we're talking about our energy jobs or even just recently, the conversations we're having about President Trump's Rural Health Transformation bill to put resources up front to save public expenditures at the back end. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I want to ask you about that. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- That's the kind of good working relationship we've had.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that because I know West Virginia has one of the highest rates in the country for government insurance. There's concern about rural hospitals. There is this Rural Health Transformation Program Congress set up. Your state could get $100 million a year for five years, but your West Virginia Hospital Association says that your hospitals are going to lose more than a billion dollars per year because of this latest Big Beautiful Bill Republicans passed. How do you make up that kind of shortfall?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Well, I think what President Trump and RFK and Dr. Oz are trying to do is common sense. If you subscribe to the adage a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, what they're trying to do is invest the single largest amount of money in improving rural health. And in West Virginia that means everything because we're a very rural state. So the resources can go to invest in our people, to invest in our hospitals, our providers and the technology that actually can move the needle in terms of improving health care outcomes --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- up front. Attacking obesity and COPD and substance use disorder.\u00a0 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- So we're really excited about that, because if we apply the resources the right way --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- I don't think we're going to have the diminution of public expenditures at the back end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: This is the common sense approach we're seeing from the Trump administration --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- that we're not seeing from Schumer --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Alright. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- and Democrats in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Thank you. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with New Jersey Gov.-elect , a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Friday we spoke to one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress \u2013 and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown, she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended.",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight, because we see in the market, costs going up by 175% if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the One Big, Beautiful Bill to people's access to health care. And you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally, and courts are holding him accountable. We see with air traffic control problem, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So we're already down by 25%. Now, with this crisis going on because the President refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10% in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights. So, it's time that the government- that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate, get serious about opening up government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy, and you can't justify the damage, which is why the President and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open, and they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people. I think what we saw with this election is the American people, you know, really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs, but also that I'm going to continue to fight that- for Washington, to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs and everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which is continuing to raise costs on education and innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short term funding bill, and over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, It shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making rent payments, trying to borrow. He said, Dems view this as leverage, and he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have. How do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House. They've even, many would say- including myself, taken over the court system. Then they have a responsibility to open up this government, and I have to tell you as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is \u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was Whip Clark who said those votes are leverage.",
      "REP. SHERRILL: We're- leverage to serve the American people. I mean, we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care. Look, if if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175% for people here in New Jersey, at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care that's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in now, which is raising gas prices. So again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people, and these Republicans have got to come to the table, and they've got to start really working for the American people, and this election showed that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: So we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people, and Republicans, again and again, are refusing to address that. So right now--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the leader Thune said they'll hold a vote--",
      "REP. SHERRILL:\u00a0 --part of how we get the government open and they should do it right now, I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people, we can drive down health care costs, and that's really key.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular, you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19% over the past year, versus 6% nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: So the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes, because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months, and I- you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate payer, and we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people. So the utility companies have already come to the table to say, okay, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BPU to defray the cost. But what's really going to also happen is, very quickly, I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons, and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the cost of elect- of electricity we have to buy on the market. So that's why, immediately, I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage, and then in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities, and in the long term, nuclear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that there's a feeling working people have not been heard, and that there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today. What? What did you mean by that?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: That- as I was talking to people across the state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down, and something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter. I'm not doing a 10 year plan. I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency, not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that the costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing, but it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey, so that they know that this is a day one issue for me. They also want to see somebody though that has their backs, because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is going to take away their health care. They know that attacks on the Gateway Tunnel Project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus, Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging- in particular women who fear the impact on children. What do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, we've worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and- and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge issue for me and for people across the state. As we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc., but it is a scary time. I remember right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place, and here I have four kids, and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running? But you know what? I think most of us are weighing as moms if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races, and also some of the great, powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So I don't think it's dissuading them, but it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next Governor of New Jersey. Thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Democratic governor elect of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, she joins us this morning from Glen Allen, just outside of Richmond. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Virginia boasts one of the highest numbers of federal workers in the country, and as you know, many of them are not getting paid. You know, some in your party look at your election on Tuesday and the win in New Jersey and say that is permission to hold the line in Congress and refuse to fund the government or fold on the shutdown. Should congressional Democrats view your victory that way?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Absolutely not. Our victory was a victory that was based on a campaign that was addressing concerns related to costs and chaos. My campaign across the past two years have been focused on hearing the challenges that people are facing all across Virginia. It's rising costs in health care, housing, energy, and it's the chaos coming out of Washington that has been impacting Virginians so severely, beginning with the DOGE efforts, of course, continuing with chaotic trade policies, and now in this government shutdown. Virginians need to and Virginians want to see the government reopen, and my expectation is that we will see a congress, a Senate, and ultimately a president, driving us in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should congressional Democrats open the government and then talk about health care?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The government needs to open and it needs to open immediately. We need the president to demonstrate leadership, bringing people together, endeavoring to get through whatever negotiations need to get through, whether it's before or after. My priority is the, is focusing on the needs and the, the devastation, frankly, that more than 300,000 Virginians are facing. And that's just the federal employees, government contractors, they will never get made whole. The entirety of Virginia's economy is impacted by the shutdown, just as we've been impacted by Doge attacks, and the government needs to reopen quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why I'm asking, because there are what, 825,000 enrollees on food aid in the SNAP program. They're in limbo right now. You have immediate pain, so at what point do you weigh that against the potential of health care premiums? I mean, this pain is very real and very acute for people in your state right now.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And it's been going on now for weeks, weeks too long the government needs to reopen because in addition to the pain that we are already seeing\u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "But eight Democrats could cross the aisle and do so.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We absolutely need everyone to vote to open the government. And that's not to say that the challenges we're facing within our health care system are not also immediate and acute. Even the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill will have catastrophic impacts on Virginia, taking $26 billion out of our health care, leading to the closure of at least six rural hospitals. We've already seen three rural clinics announce their closure. Hundreds of 1000s will lose their Medicaid, and so the impacts on health care are already catastrophic. We cannot compound that pain by keeping the government closed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's take a break and finish this on the other side of it. Please stay with us.",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We return to our conversation with Virginia Governor elect Abigail Spanberger. Governor-elect, artificial intelligence has created a really big demand for these data centers, and Virginia has the world's largest concentration of them. Power bills are up nearly 7% in your state over the past year. Is that driven by the AI boom? And if so, how do you offset those rising energy costs?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, what we've seen in the, in the research so far is that it is not, the increased costs are not driven by the increase in data centers. There's some bad energy policies in some of our neighboring states that have driven up prices, particularly in southwest Virginia. But looking towards the future, we have to be clear eyed about the fact that we will have an energy crisis headed into the future. And so here on the ground in Virginia, we currently have a rate case where it will be important that large scale energy users, particularly data centers, that the public, know that they are paying their fair share for the energy that they are using. And we have to increase our energy production here at home so that we can meet the demand, certainly of larger scale energy users, but, but also of increased demand from, from our communities. And it is a real challenge that we have to get ahead of. And that's why among the first affordability plans that I laid out was one focused on energy. It's a challenge that is pervasive across our communities and particularly acute in southwest Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a few days ago, Cornell University reached a $60 million deal with the Trump administration in order to see their federal funding restored. This is the fifth such deal since the administration began this pressure campaign on universities. I know you went to University of Virginia, as did I, and must be following that. UVA cut deals with the government, including kicking out the president of the school. You called that extortion. But now, as governor, are you going to have to play ball with the Department of Education and the Justice Department in order to keep federal government funding going?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: So it should, It should shock everyone that universities, public and private, are receiving demands from the federal government and that dollars, research dollars, are being withheld, that our universities are under attack. And certainly what we've seen in the case the University of Virginia, a popular, experienced, excellent president was pushed out, and on the ground here, we did not see our governor in any way step up in defense of our university. And the idea that the federal government would be withholding federal dollars, including dollars already appropriated by Congress for research, in order to compel universities to take certain actions, it is absolute federal government overreach, and as governor, I will be clear eyed about ensuring that we have structures in place, including boards of visitors across our universities that want to defend academic freedom and frankly, the viability and vitality of extraordinary institutions like the University of Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your party. In 2020 when Democrats lost House seats, you said we need to not ever use the word socialist or socialism ever again. There are some who look to Tuesday's win in New York City of a Democratic socialist and say that your, your party is actually being rewarded for echoing progressive policies. Does that victory create a branding problem for Democrats?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, you know, I'm excited about what we did here in Virginia on Tuesday. I campaigned addressing, wanting to address the issues of costs and stopping the chaos. I'm a capitalist, I'm a Democrat, and I won by 15 points in Virginia. You look to New Jersey, and a similar story in Mikie Sherrill's win now the governor elect there. And so I think, you know, certainly, we're a big tent party, but when I look at what led to the success that we had here, and the, you know, the mandate for real governance here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was based on what I campaigned on, the efforts to really address the challenges that people are facing in a day to day basis. And now it's on us to deliver and prove that that really truly the the mandate that we have to work on lowering costs and strengthening our schools and keeping our communities safe and and creating steady leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly in light of the chaos coming out of Washington, that not only was it a winning message, but the winning path towards governance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time this morning, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, the, who will be the first female governor ever of the state of Virginia. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore. Good to have you here in person.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Great to be with you. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid. Since the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food?",
      "GOV. MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting. It is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they are, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid. And I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the President of the United States to finally do his job. We are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts. The USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all, what's the federal government telling you?",
      "GOV. MOORE: There is no clarity- clarity at all. In the past- in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it. Where initially it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help, to support and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people, and then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be okay--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You are fronting the money?--",
      "GOV. MOORE: -- That we are going to front the money. We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money. There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars, they got money for ballrooms, they got money for everything, but when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those- those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money. But on- on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself. On Friday, we did see the Democratic Leader Schumer offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies. Republicans said that's a- that's a nonstarter. This is going to make this a big issue for the midterms. But would you- would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in? That the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end, for an extension of a tax credit?",
      "GOV. MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, DC.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland. We have over 260,000 federal workers within our state. That even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country. But I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90%, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar- there's a- there's a- there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump you know- the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate. They can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government. Why isn't that good enough? Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to- to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care. That when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia, and I'm proud to serve as the as the- as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional- Regional Commission where we're serving Appalachia all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say yes, it's okay, if you just watch my health care go away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up, even in the private market, for a lot of different reasons. But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland. This past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50. 64% of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats. This is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: --this is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this- go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland. I'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state?",
      "GOV. MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process. It's the reason that I put together this commission where my job is not to draw the maps, that- what we've just simply said is I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to. That's not the way this process is going to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your State Senate President, Democrat Bill Ferguson says this could backfire. He wrote, 'I believe mid cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately, democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration.' How do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this Commission provides to you?",
      "GOV. MOORE: No, I think the commission of what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps, and frankly, it's a state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate President and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in. He agrees on the fact that we have watched a administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply- and where we- where we differ, is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires. And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more 'Face the Nation.' So, stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin this morning with the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. This is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to US troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Right, I think that- that's about the right number. And the problem is that under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties. And so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules--",
      "HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open. I mean, the fact is Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5% off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays. And one of these things every now and then when we're talking economics, you and I, we talk about seasonal adjustments and things like that. But the fact is that Thanksgiving, that Thanksgiving time, is one of the hottest times of the year for the economy. It's Black Friday, you know, and all that kind of stuff. And if people aren't traveling at that moment, then we really could be looking at a negative quarter for the fourth quarter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is significantly disruptive to the president's agenda. But to the point you were just making about food stamps, and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA. But why not do this as a short term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food?",
      "HASSETT: Well, the president's job, and all of our jobs, is to uphold the law. And when- I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us--",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are--",
      "HASSETT: what we can do--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that wasn't done with the military.",
      "HASSETT: But, but, but yeah, I think that the military is different because of the commander-in-chief stuff. But the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book, and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes. Which you know, you know about- in the season of lawfare, if you are a cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits?",
      "HASSETT: Let's just say that we've seen Democrats--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --if, if Congress is going to fund it, when the shut- shutdown ends?",
      "HASSETT: We- we've seen Democrats take to court people that- on really, really poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point.",
      "HASSETT: Well, we, we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid, 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now. I know you're talking to the Governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the healthcare premiums, but do that through regular order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about healthcare. But the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said, I'm recommended- to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad healthcare provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own much better healthcare. He also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about healthcare right now.",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an off--",
      "HASSETT: --And this is- you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open. And one of the things you could do is conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And you know, everybody believes that people should have healthcare, and so why not take the people who have higher healthcare premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide? The reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance, and it could be that people would rather have the money and go from like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit. And so that's, that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal?",
      "HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy- I haven't talked to him about it yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept--",
      "HASSETT: --The president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --this proposal?--",
      "HASSETT: -- the president started this idea yesterday, I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president--",
      "HASSETT: It's the weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The Senate's in session this weekend--",
      "HASSETT: --Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend and we are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: because they're trying to end the shutdown--",
      "HASSETT: --And here I am.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position.",
      "HASSETT: As of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open.",
      "HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on healthcare, that healthcare costs are too high.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I think that if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they're worried about the budgetary costs. And so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team would be about 120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases. And I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing- again most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability, and our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38%, the lowest of this term. 75% of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices, but the president said this week Democrats are making it up and quote, \"every price is down.\" I'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3%, in September from a year ago.",
      "HASSETT: --well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you dispute that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, actually, let's go through the facts, right? Inflation went up about 5% under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7%. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices--",
      "HASSETT: --No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --but depends on which--",
      "HASSETT: Let me-- I'll just make a point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "HASSETT: That if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000 because we had up to 9% inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying. The real spending power, adjusted for inflation, under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year. $1,200 is not $3,000, and so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the positive things about the economy, industrial production just about at an all time high, capital spending about at an all time high, GDP growth right now about 4%, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening. And the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected, and it would have been even lower because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming, but we understand 100% why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3% inflation?",
      "HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2% inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no, you're not happy where things are now.",
      "HASSETT: Well, they got to go down a little bit more, but there- but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say, so when you go from almost 4% that we had in January down to the mid twos, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half a percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices?",
      "HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two tenths and five tenths. And the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. It would be a one time level adjust. Our estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs. Because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff, and there's a tariff, so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the US.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here. Of course, we have to leave it there for now. We'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us.",

It also closes a painful, 11-year saga for his family and in Israel, where Goldin has become a national symbol.",
      "At the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said that holding the body for so long has caused \"great agony of his family, which will now be able to give him a Jewish burial.\"",
      "Goldin's family spearheaded a very public campaign, along with the family of another soldier whose body was taken in 2014, to bring their sons home for burial. Israel recovered the remains of the other soldier, Oron Shaul, earlier this year.",
      "Netanyahu said that the government would continue trying to bring home the bodies of other Israelis killed while serving the country, including Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy hanged in Damascus in 1965, whose exploits were celebrated in 'The Spy', a 2019 television series.",
      "Israeli media, citing anonymous officials, had previously reported that Hamas was delaying the release of Goldin's body in hopes of negotiating safe passage for more than 100 militants surrounded by Israeli forces and trapped in the enclave's southernmost city of Rafah.",
      "Gila Gamliel, the minister of innovation, science and technology and a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, told Army Radio that Israel isn't negotiating for a deal within a deal.",
      "\"There are agreements whose implementation is guaranteed by the mediators, and we shouldn't allow anyone to come now and play (games) and to reopen the agreement,\" she said.",
      "Hamas did not comment on a possible exchange for its fighters stuck in the so-called yellow zone, which is controlled by Israeli forces, though they acknowledged that there are clashes taking place there.",
      "American-Israeli soldier laid to rest",
      "The funeral for Staff Sgt. Itay Chen, an American-Israeli soldier who was killed during Hamas' terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose body was returned last week, was held Sunday in Tel Aviv.",
      "Chen, 19, of the 77th Battalion of the 7th Brigade, was abducted by Hamas after falling from a tank and his death was officially confirmed on March 10, 2024.",
      "Hundreds gathered for his funeral at Kiryat Shaul Cemetery in Tel Aviv on Sunday.",
      "\"I did not know Itay in body, but I came to know him through the strength of those who loved him. His family's courage, their refusal to let this world forget him, became a beacon not only for myself, but for so many others worldwide,\"\u00a0 U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said in a eulogy. \"They reminded us that even in the darkness, light is not extinguished. It waits to be carried by those who refuse to give up.\"",
      "Since the ceasefire began last month, militants have released the remains of 23 hostages. As part of the truce deal, the militants are expected to return all of the remains of hostages.",
      "For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. Ahmed Dheir, director of forensic medicine at Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, said that the remains of 300 have now been returned, with 89 identified.",
      "The war began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians, and 251 people were kidnapped.",
      "On Saturday, Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said that the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza has risen to 69,176. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 11:41:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, Fung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with its 1,118-mile-wide rain and wind band, forecasters said.",
    "story": [
      "Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed ashore on Sunday in the northeastern coast of the Philippines, where the massive storm had already left at least two people dead and forced more than a million people to evacuate from flood- and landslide-prone areas, officials said.",
      "The typhoon blew into Dinalungan town in Aurora province Sunday night after setting off fierce rain and wind in northeastern Philippine provinces all day from offshore, with sustained winds of up to 115 mph and gusts of up to 143 mph.",
      "The biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, Fung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with its 1,118-mile-wide rain and wind band, forecasters said. It approached from the Pacific while the Philippines was still dealing with the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which left at least 224 people dead in central provinces on Tuesday before pummelling Vietnam, where at least five were killed.",
      "A villager drowned in flash floods in the eastern province of Catanduanes and another died in Catbalogan city in eastern Samar province when she was hit by debris, officials said.",
      "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has declared a state of emergency due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected calamity from Fung-wong, which is also called Uwan in the Philippines.",
      "Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) or higher are categorized in the Philippines as a super typhoon, a designation adopted years ago to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances.",
      "'Zero visibility'",
      "\"The rain and wind were so strong there was nearly zero visibility,\" Roberto Monterola, a disaster-mitigation officer for Catanduanes, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "Despite calls for residents to evacuate on Saturday, some still stayed on.",
      "\"Our personnel rescued 14 people who were trapped on the roof of a house engulfed in flood in a low-lying neighborhood,\" Monterola said. \"A father also called in panic, saying the roof of his house was about to be ripped off by the wind. We saved him and four relatives.\"",
      "Over a million people were evacuated from high-risk villages in northeastern provinces, including in Bicol, a coastal region vulnerable to Pacific cyclones and mudflows from Mayon, one of the country's most active volcanoes.",
      "Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. warned about the potentially catastrophic impact of Fung-wong in televised remarks Saturday. He said the storm could affect a vast expanse of the country, including Cebu, the central province hit hardest by the previous typhoon, and metropolitan Manila, the densely populated capital region.",
      "More than 30 million people could be exposed to hazards posed by Fung-wong, the Office of Civil Defense said.",
      "Teodoro asked people to follow government orders and seek shelter away from villages and towns prone to flash floods, landslides and coastal tidal surges. \"We need to do this because when it's already raining or the typhoon has hit and flooding has started, it's hard to rescue people,\" Teodoro said.",
      "Power cut in eastern towns",
      "The Philippines has not called for international help following the devastation caused by Kalmaegi, but Teodoro said the United States, the country's longtime treaty ally, and Japan were ready to provide assistance.",
      "As Fung-wong approached with its wide band of fierce wind and rain, several eastern towns and cities lost power, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, deputy administrator of the Office of Civil Defense, said.",
      "Authorities in northern provinces that could be hit or sideswiped by Fung-wong preemptively shut schools and most government offices on Monday and Tuesday. At least 325 domestic and 61 international flights have been canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in seaports, where the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas.",
      "Authorities warned of a \"high risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge\" of more than 3 meters (nearly 10 feet) along the coasts of more than 20 provinces and regions, including metropolitan Manila.",
      "The Philippines is battered by about 20\u00a0typhoons\u00a0and storms each year. The country is also often hit by\u00a0earthquakes\u00a0and has more than a dozen\u00a0active volcanoes, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.",

    "story": [
      "A strong earthquake and several subsequent tremors rattled northern Japan on Sunday evening, triggering tsunami advisories along the coast, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.",
      "The earthquake, with an upgraded magnitude of 6.9 and depth of 20 kilometers \u2014 or about 12 miles \u2014 struck off the coast of Iwate prefecture at 5:03 p.m. Japan time, according to the meteorological agency.",
      "There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, or any reports of abnormalities at the two nuclear power plants in the area.",
      "The agency issued advisories for areas along Japan's northern coast where the tsunami could reach 1 meter, or 3 feet, although meteorologists initially said the water to rise as high as 3 meters, or about 9 feet, in some locations. It downgraded tsunami advisories to tsunami forecasts in several places along that coastal region, which means the tsunami's impact was then expected to be 0.2 meters, or about 8 inches, high. Tsunami forecasts are issued when \"slight sea level changes\" are expected, according to the agency.",
      "A tsunami of about 10 centimeters, or about 4 inches, was detected at Ofunato city in Iwate Prefecture, Ominato port, Miyako and Kamaishi, and subsequently as high as 20 centimeters, or about 8 inches, in the coastal area of Kuji. The tsunami that followed in Ofunato also reached 20 centimeters, or about 8 inches, according to the agency.",
      "Tsunami waves that follow earthquakes can continue for a few hours afterward, hitting the coast repeatedly, and can possibly get bigger with time.",
      "While the advisory was in place, people were warned to stay away from the ocean and coastal areas and told that more shaking could follow in the area.",
      "The tsunami advisory was lifted about three hours after the initial quake, but the meteorological agency told reporters the area was at risk for strong quakes for about a week, especially the next two or three days.",
      "More quakes were recorded in Iwate Prefecture, and the northernmost major island of Hokkaido was also rocked by the series of quakes.",
      "Northeastern Japan is prone to earthquakes, including a triple disaster of a quake, tsunami and a nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, just south of Iwate, in March 2011, that killed nearly 20,000 people, mostly from the tsunami, and severely damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station.",
      "More than a decade later, people still remain displaced from the no-go zone. Demonstrations are still periodically held, as recently as Saturday, to protest what is being seen as a lack of recognition by the authorities of the serious risks of nuclear power.",
      "An agency official, briefing reporters late Sunday, said there was nothing to indicate the latest quake was directly related to the one in 2011, except that the region was generally at risk for major quakes, including another one that hit in 1992.",
      "Bullet trains in the area were temporarily delayed, according to the JR East railway operator. Japan, which sits on the Pacific \"ring of fire,\" is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.",

      "Moscow and Kyiv have traded almost daily assaults on each other's energy targets as U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to stop the nearly four-year war had no impact on the battlefield.",
      "Ukraine's long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue the war. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid and deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to \"weaponize winter.\"",
      "Russian forces, meanwhile, repelled a \"massive\" nighttime strike on energy facilities in the southern Volgograd region, its Gov. Andrei Bocharov said Saturday, two days after Ukraine claimed to have hit a key oil refinery there with long-range drones. Bocharov added that the strike knocked out power in parts of the region's northwest, but caused no casualties. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said on Saturday that its forces shot down 82 Ukrainian drones during the night, including eight over the Volgograd region. Two people were injured in the neighboring Saratov region after a Ukrainian drone strike blew out windows in an apartment block, according to regional Gov. Roman Busarin.",
      "Pokrovsk sits along the eastern front line, part of what has been dubbed the \"fortress belt\" of Donetsk, a line of heavily fortified cities crucial to Ukraine's defense of the region.

    "published": "Sat, 08 Nov 2025 13:02:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.N. human rights chief warned that many Sudanese are still trapped in el-Fasher in the western Darfur region.",
    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of Sudanese have fled to overcrowded camps to escape reported atrocities by a paramilitary force since it captured el-Fasher in the western Darfur region, an aid group said Saturday. The U.N.'s human rights chief warned that many others are still trapped.",
      "Those who reach shelter in Tawila, about 43 miles from el-Fasher, find themselves stranded in a barren area with barely enough tents, many of them improvised from patched tarps and sheets, according to a video posted by the group Sudan's IDPs and Refugee Camps. It shows children running across the area as a few adults carry a large pot of food, hoping it will be enough to feed the growing crowds of displaced.",
      "Since the Rapid Support Forces seized el-Fasher from the rival military Oct. 26, more than 16,200 people have fled to the camps in Tawila, said Adam Rojal, spokesperson for the aid group. The International Organization for Migration estimates that around 82,000 people had fled the city and surrounding areas as of Nov. 4, heading to safe spots including Tawila, an area already overcrowded with the displaced from previous attacks, with some making the journey on foot.",
      "The RSF and the Sudanese army have been at war since April 2023, following simmering tensions over control of Africa's third-largest nation. At least 40,000 people have been killed, according to the World Health Organization, though the actual toll might be many times higher. Some 12 million people have been displaced, and nearly half the population is facing acute food insecurity.",
      "Last week, the RSF seized el-Fasher after an 18-month siege. The paramilitary rampaged through the Saudi Hospital\u00a0in the city, killing over 450 people, according to the WHO, and went house to house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults. The RSF has denied killing anyone at the Saudi hospital, but testimonies from those fleeing, online videos and satellite images offer an apocalyptic vision of the attack.",
      "The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Friday that 300 people arrived in Tawila on Thursday alone after fleeing el-Fasher. MSF teams reported \"extremely high levels of malnutrition among children and adults.\"",
      "The displaced in Tawila are in urgent need of food, medicine, shelter materials and psychosocial support, Rojal told The Associated Press. He said that families often survive on just two meals a day \u2014 and sometimes only one.",
      "U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker T\u00fcrk warned that those left behind in el-Fasher are at risk.",
      "\"Today, traumatized civilians are still trapped inside el-Fasher and are being prevented from leaving,\" he said Friday in Geneva.",
      "\"I fear that the abominable atrocities such as summary executions, rape and ethnically motivated violence are continuing within the city,\" he added. \"And for those who manage to flee, the violence does not end, as the exit routes themselves have been the scenes of unimaginable cruelty.\"",
      "On Thursday, the RSF said it has agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by a U.S.-led mediator group known as the Quad. Meanwhile, the army said it welcomes the Quad's proposal, but will only agree to it if RSF withdraw from civilian areas and give up their weapons.",
      "The fighting has spread across Darfur and to the neighboring Kordofan region, with both emerging as the epicenter of Sudan's war over the past months. Early this week, a drone attack in el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan province, killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens more.",
      "A military official told the AP on Saturday that the army intercepted two Chinese-made drones\u00a0that targeted el-Obeid on Saturday morning. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose the information.",
      "Jalale Getachew Birru, an analyst for East Africa with Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, said in a statement Friday that the fall of el-Fasher and rising violence in North Kordofan mark a strategic victory for the RSF, but exacerbate human suffering. He estimated that at least 2,000 people were killed across Sudan in a single week between Oct. 26 and Nov. 1.",
      "\"These events not only deepen Sudan's humanitarian crisis but also signal the RSF's growing capacity to expand toward central Sudan, threatening to reverse the success of the Sudanese armed forces and returning the violence to the relatively calm central Sudan,\" said Birru.",

      "Mr. Trump had already announced he would not attend the annual summit for heads of state, with Vice President JD Vance being scheduled to attend in the president's place. However, a person familiar with Vance's plans who was granted anonymity to talk about his schedule said the vice president would no longer travel for the summit.",
      "\"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa.

    "story": [
      "Spanish police arrested 13 suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua\u00a0across five cities, seized a stash of illegal drugs and dismantled two drug laboratories, authorities said Friday.",
      "The arrests followed an investigation Spanish police opened last year after the brother of \"Ni\u00f1o Guerrero,\" the leader of the Tren de Aragua gang, was arrested in Barcelona under an international arrest warrant issued by Venezuelan authorities, police said. This was Spain's first operation meant to dismantle a suspect cell of the Venezuelan prison gang, police said in a statement.",
      "The two laboratories that police dismantled had been used to make tusi, a mixture of cocaine, MDMA and ketamine, police said. Video shows authorities finding packages and a pink substance inside a residence.\u00a0\u00a0The arrests took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Girona, A Coru\u00f1a and Valencia.",
      "The Tren de Aragua gang originated in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in the central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years as more than 7.7 million Venezuelans\u00a0fled\u00a0economic turmoil and migrated to other Latin American countries, the U.S. and Spain.",
      "The gang has become a key reference in the Trump administration's crackdown against alleged drug smugglers. The administration announced yet another\u00a0deadly U.S. strike\u00a0on a boat officials said was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean Sea on Friday. At least 18 such strikes have killed at least 70 people.",
      "The United States began\u00a0carrying out the strikes\u00a0\u2014 which experts say amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers \u2014 in\u00a0early September, taking aim at vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The Trump administration has said in a notice to Congress that the United States is engaged in \"armed conflict\" with Latin American drug cartels, describing them as terrorist groups as part of its justification for the strikes.",
      "President Trump had previously designated Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization, along with MS-13 and other gangs and cartels. Mr. Trump\u00a0invoked\u00a0the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in March to treat suspected gang members like wartime enemies of the U.S. government, an action that has only been taken three other times in United States history.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian forces managed to rescue one of their own recently \u2014 a wounded soldier trapped for 33 days behind enemy lines \u2014 by sending a casket-shaped, off-road robot to navigate a perilous route dodging landmines and drone attacks to retrieve him.",
      "After six failed rescue attempts, the 1st Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian Ground Forces managed to rescue the soldier from Russian-occupied territory in the east of the country.",
      "The remotely operated robot, which looks like an armored casket mounted on an ATV frame and wheels, traveled a total of about 40 miles for the mission \u2014 almost 23 of them with a damaged wheel after it struck a landmine. The mission took just under six hours, according to the battalion, which shared a video of the operation on social media this week.",
      "\"We received a request from an adjacent unit to try to evacuate their soldier,\" the medical battalion's head of communications Volodymyr Koval told CBS News on Friday. \"They had already made four attempts on their own, but they were unsuccessful. They turned to us because we had the appropriate capabilities.\"",
      "The most important of those capabilities was the robot, a MAUL ground drone originally developed by the medical battalion precisely for the purpose of extracting wounded or trapped soldiers.",
      "\"The soldier's location was known, there was contact with him, food was being sent to him from the air \u2014 logistics were carried out by aerial drones. We began to develop a plan for his evacuation and study the route,\" Koval told CBS News. \"Two attempts were unsuccessful due to enemy mines and drones waiting on the ground in ambush on the roads. The seventh mission was successful, despite the fact that the drone hit an anti-personnel mine.\"",
      "The robot reached the soldier, who climbed into the personnel capsule, laid down and closed himself inside. But the rolling rescue unit then came under attack by a Russian drone on its way back toward the battle line. The soldier survived thanks to the armored capsule.",
      "Military medics provided first aid and stabilized the soldier as soon as the robot reached Ukrainian-controlled territory.",
      "\"The wounded warrior is now undergoing treatment and rehabilitation. His life has been saved,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video statement Thursday evening. He lauded the troops of the 1st Medical Battalion for the operation, stressing the importance of such lifesaving missions and battlefield innovations.",
      "\"We will scale up exactly this kind of technological backbone for our army \u2014 more ground robotic systems operating at the front, more drones of all types, and increased deliveries of modern solutions that help achieve results in combat, in providing supplies for our combat units, and in evacuating our wounded warriors,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Koval told CBS News it was not the first and would likely not be the last ground-based drone evacuation carried out by the battalion.",
      "\"This is simply a special story of perseverance that carries an important message for the military and society. We are actively trying to implement unmanned evacuation from the battlefield, directly from the line of combat contact. This is the main task of our unit,\" he said. \"Evacuation is now very difficult due to the high density of fire, which is visible in the video. But every Ukrainian soldier must know that they will fight for him, that they will try to save him. This is what we wanted to show by telling this story.\"",
      "The MAUL robot used in the operation was originally designed by the 1st Medical Battalion, but is now made and sold by Ukrainian defense company DevDroid, which bought the license to the design.",
      "According to the battalion, the MAUL robot \"is an evacuation platform powered by an internal combustion engine, which allows it to reach speeds of up to 70 kph (43 mph). It has a special armored capsule to protect the wounded and special metal wheels that do not contain air.\"",
      "The units are now sold by DevDroid for about $19,000 each.",
      "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian National Guard's 13th Khartia Brigade used a Zmiy-500 ground drone, a simpler robot that offers less protection to the person riding it, to evacuate a wounded soldier while simultaneously delivering supplies to the front line, according to a social media post by the brigade.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Democrats on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter on Thursday to the former Prince Andrew, now Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, requesting that the disgraced British royal appear before Congress for questioning over his former ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"The Committee is seeking to uncover the identities of Mr. Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers and to understand the full extent of his criminal operations,\" said the letter, which was signed by the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, and 14 others.",
      "\"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr. Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation. In the interest of justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, we request that you cooperate with the Committee's investigation by sitting for a transcribed interview with the Committee,\" the American lawmakers said.",
      "Neither Garcia nor the committee has the power to subpoena Andrew, who was formally stripped of the title of prince on Thursday.",
      "No Republicans on the House committee signed the letter.",
      "The communication cited Andrew's widely reported friendship with Epstein, which continued after the American financier's 2008 conviction for procuring minors for prostitution. It also mentioned Andrew's visits to Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Epstein's trip to the late Queen Elizabeth II's residence at Balmoral in Scotland.",
      "\"This close relationship with Mr. Epstein, coupled with the recently revealed 2011 email exchange in which you wrote to him 'we are in this together,' further confirms our suspicion that you may have valuable information about the crimes committed by Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators,\" the letter said.",
      "It also cited a number of allegations by the late Virginia Giuffre, including that she was \"lent out\" to Andrew by Epstein on a number of occasions.",
      "\"In response to a subpoena issued to the Epstein estate, the Committee has identified financial records containing notations such as \"massage for Andrew\" that raise serious questions regarding the nature of your relationship with Mr. Epstein and related financial transactions,\" the letter said.",
      "The House Democrats also mentioned Giuffre's memoir, which was published posthumously this year, in which she mentioned her fear of Andrew retaliating if she publicized allegations against him.",
      "\"This fear of retaliation has been a persistent obstacle to many of those who were victimized in their fight for justice. In addition to Mr. Epstein's crimes, we are investigating any such efforts to silence, intimidate, or threaten victims, and are interested in any avenues that may further shed light on these activities,\" the letter said.",
      "Andrew was asked to respond to the letter by Nov. 20th, \"due to the urgency and gravity of this matter.\"",
      "He was stripped of both his \"Royal Highness\" and \"prince\" titles on Thursday, and last month he gave up other royal titles, including \"Duke of York.\"",
      "He had already stepped down from public duties as a member of the royal family in 2019, after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "After allowing his younger brother to slowly and voluntarily give up his royal honors for months, King Charles III announced abruptly on October 30 \u2014 after more revelations about Andrew's past ties to Epstein \u2014 that he would be deprived of the titles and evicted from his long-time, 30-bedroom mansion on the Windsor estate.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dolphins-dead-amazon-lake-water-hotter-jacuzzi-study/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 08:33:14 -0500",
    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

    "summary": "Archaeologists discovered evidence of an ancient religious group while excavating an area in northern Israel, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered evidence of an ancient religious practice in northern Israel in addition to a wine press dating back roughly 5,000 years \u2014 one of the oldest ever uncovered in the country, according to the\u00a0Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "The wine press, which is likewise the earliest relic of wine production in Israel, was found during an excavation at the archaeological site Tel Megiddo, said the agency, which noted that the work was conducted ahead of the planned construction of a highway through the same area.",
      "Officials said the wine press, which was carved from stone, was evidence that a Canaanite religious group existed at the site thousands of the years ago. The Canaanites were ancient indigenous people who inhabited the area known as Canaan, which was located in \"the Levant\" along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, from Greece to western Europe, according to EBSCO. They were a group of mixed ethnicities although the Hebrew Bible distinguishes them from Israelites and teaches that Israelites arrived later than they did.",
      "Dr. Amir Golani and Barak Tzin, excavation directors for the Israel Antiquities Authority, said the wine press discovery was unprecedented.",
      "\"Until now, indirect evidence indicated that wine could have been produced 5,000 years ago, but we did not have conclusive proof of this \u2013 a 'smoking gun' that would clearly show when this happened in our area,\" they said in a statement. \"This wine press finally provides new and clear evidence that early wine production actually took place here.\"",
      "In addition to the wine press, archaeologists found a model of a small temple and one set of ceremonial utensils, which were approximately 3,300 years old. Those were among a wider collection of items found during excavations in the region, which covered about three-fourths of a mile and \"uncovered many finds from different periods,\" the authority said. Their discoveries spanned the early Bronze Age, which ran from about 3300 to 3000 B.C.E., and the late Bronze Age, which ran from about 1550 to 1400 B.C.E.",
      "There was more evidence of early Canaanite populations in the area, the authority said. They included residential buildings uncovered around the wine press, ritual vessels and pottery imported from Cyprus, which are thought to illuminate some of the ancient peoples' ritual ceremonies and cultures.",
      "The new discoveries were put on display Thursday at the annual conference on innovations and research in Israeli excavations, which was organized by the Israel Antiquities Authority an the School of Archaeology and Maritime Civilizations at the University of Haifa.",

    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel breaks down the latest American Heart Association data.",
      "A deep clean at the dentist may benefit more than just your oral health.",
      "In a two-year study of people with periodontitis or severe gum disease, researchers from University College London (UCL) found that those who got intensive treatment \u2014 a full-mouth deep cleaning with regular follow-ups \u2014 had slower thickening and clogging of a major neck artery and better blood-vessel function than those who only got routine cleanings.",
      "The randomized controlled trial tracked 135 adults at UCL\u2019s Eastman Dental Institute who had periodontitis, which can stem from poor oral hygiene, genetics, smoking or uncontrolled diabetes, according to the research published this month in the European Heart Journal.",

      "At 12 and 24 months, participants who received intensive deep cleanings showed less gum inflammation and fewer bacteria entering the bloodstream, and their arteries were healthier than those who got standard scale-and-polish care, which only removes plaque and tartar buildup.",
      "A new study found that deep dental cleanings could benefit heart health. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Marco Orlandi, co-author of the trial, said in a statement that the participants who received the intensive gum disease treatment had a 0.02 millimeter reduction in the thickening of their carotid arteries after two years.",
      "\"This is a significant result, as even a 0.01 millimeter reduction corresponds to a 10% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting participants reduced their risk by around 10% each year,\" Orlandi said.",
      "Doctors track the thickness of the carotid artery wall as an early warning sign for clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This study didn\u2019t count actual heart events, but the artery changes, along with lower gum inflammation, suggest that improved oral health could help fight cardiovascular disease.",

      "7 STEPS TO \u2018SUPER-AGING\u2019 ARE KEY TO LIVING A LONGER, MORE FULFILLING LIFE, EXPERTS SAY",

      "Below are the five strategies that Attia shared with \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "No. 1: Train like life is a sport",
      "Attia recommends approaching life \u2014 particularly in advanced age \u2014 like an athlete would approach a sport.",
      "As people age, their level of fitness, strength and mobility matters more than many traditional markers, he noted.",
      "7 COMMON FITNESS MISTAKES OLDER ADULTS MAKE AND HOW TO AVOID THEM FOR BETTER WORKOUTS",
      "The longevity expert said he logs about 10 hours per week of exercise \u2014 a mix of fat-burning cardio, high-intensity intervals (to boost VO\u2082 max), and strength training to maintain muscle.",
      "Attia said he alternates between \"zone two\" exercise, which entails steady cardio activity that allows you to maintain a conversation, and\u00a0higher-intensity \"zone four\" training.",
      "No. 2: Use meaningful tests \u2014 not just standard bloodwork",
      "Attia recommends closely tracking VO\u2082 max, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body uses during strenuous exercise.",
      "VO\u2082 max is usually measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min).",
      "Longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia says most people experience a steep decline in their 70s \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure,\" Attia said. \"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or smoking status.\"",
      "\"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?\" he said. \"And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.\"",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure.\"",
      "Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" he added.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",
      "Attia also is a proponent of full-body MRI scans, which can detect cancers and other conditions earlier for better outcomes, although he warns of the potential for false positives.",
      "He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.",
      "No. 3: Eat more protein than standard guidelines suggest",
      "Boosting protein intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.",
      "Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be 55 grams for a 150-pound person or 73 grams for a 200-pound person.",
      "No. 4: Prioritize emotional, mental and relational health",
      "Emotional and mental health are just as important as physical health, according to Attia.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"It\u2019s as much a practice as what I put into exercise, blood work and cancer screening,\" he said.",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia went on. \"But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.\"",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia said. \"But if we're being deliberate and active about our emotional health, it can actually improve.\" (Getty Images)",
      "The expert credits his wife of more than two decades for enabling his progress.",
      "\"Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation,\" Attia said in the interview. \"I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life.\"",

      "No. 5: Optimize the \u2018marginal decade\u2019",
      "While decline is inevitable, Attia said his goal is to make what he calls the \"marginal decade\" as enjoyable as possible.",

    "story": [
      "Longtime broadcaster Ed Randall is working with some of the biggest names in sports to raise cancer awareness.",
      "When \"Dilbert\" creator Scott Adams recently made a public plea for help accessing a life-extending cancer treatment, the story drew national attention \u2014 and sparked some questions about the drug itself.",
      "Adams, 67, revealed in May that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate and no longer responds to standard therapies.",
      "On Sunday, Adams issued a request to President Donald Trump, via X, to help him access a newly approved drug called Pluvicto.",
      "TRUMP ADMIN RESPONDS TO 'DILBERT' CREATOR'S PLEA TO 'HELP SAVE MY LIFE' BY EXPEDITING CANCER TREATMENT",
      "A relatively new type of targeted radiation treatment for advanced prostate cancer, Pluvicto aims to slow the disease\u2019s progression \u2014 but some barriers may remain in terms of access, timing and side effects.",
      "\"My healthcare provider, Kaiser of Northern California, has approved my application to receive a newly FDA-approved drug called Pluvicto,\" Adams wrote in the post. \"But they have dropped the ball in scheduling the brief IV to administer it and I can\u2019t seem to fix that.\"",
      "\"I am declining fast. I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday. That will give me a fighting chance to stick around on this planet a little bit longer.\"",

      "PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS SEE LONGER SURVIVAL WITH NEW COMBINATION DRUG",
      "Kaiser Permanente provided the below statement to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Mr. Adams\u2019 oncology team is working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway. Since it was approved by the FDA three years ago, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s nuclear medicine and medical oncology experts have treated more than 150 patients with Lu-177 PSMA (Pluvicto) in Northern California alone. We know this drug and this disease.\"",
      "Neither the White House nor Adams immediately responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.",
      "What is Pluvicto?",
      "Pluvicto, which has the active ingredient lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan, is made by Novartis AG, a pharmaceutical company based in New Jersey.",
      "The drug delivers targeted ionizing radiation directly to tumor cells, with the goal of minimizing damage to healthy cells, Novartis told Fox News Digital.",
      "Scott Adams, cartoonist and author and creator of \"Dilbert,\" revealed in May that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate and no longer responds to standard therapies. (Getty Images)",
      "The medication is what is referred to as a \"radioligand therapy,\" according to Dr. Alan Bryce, medical oncologist and chief clinical officer at City of Hope Phoenix.",
      "\"It involves a radioactive isotope, which has been linked to a targeting molecule that delivers the isotope to prostate cancer cells,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"In this way, it has the advantage of concentrating the active drug at the site of the cancerous tissue and delivering less of the drug to healthy tissues.\"",
      "Pluvicto \"provides a nice alternative means of attack compared to the other options.\"",
      "Pluvicto is effective at both suppressing the cancer and extending the patient's life, according to Bryce. \"Its success in suppressing the cancer also means that it frequently improves symptoms, reducing pain and giving the patient more energy,\" he added.",
      "Pluvicto is currently the only radioligand therapy approved for prostate cancer, Bryce noted \u2014 \"so it provides a nice alternative means of attack compared to the other options.\"",
      "\"I am declining fast. I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday,\" Adams wrote on X. \"That will give me a fighting chance to stick around on this planet a little bit longer.\" (Getty Images)",
      "The drug was approved by the FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of adult patients with a certain type of metastatic prostate cancer \u2014 metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, which has a high level of prostate-specific membrane antigen positivity. The patients would have already received androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors (hormone-blocking drugs that help keep the cancer from growing) and taxane-based chemotherapy (which prevents cancer cells from reproducing).",
      "CANCER VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN PREVENTING RECURRENCE OF PANCREATIC, COLORECTAL TUMORS",
      "As of 2025, the drug is also approved for people who have received AR drugs and are able to delay chemotherapy.",
      "Pluvicto is typically administered via IV infusion every six weeks for up to six doses, depending on how the disease progresses and how the patient tolerates the drug.",
      "Barriers to accessing Pluvicto",
      "Shortages of the radioactive particles in Pluvicto have led to supply chain shortages in the past, which have since improved, according to Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst.",
      "Pluvicto must be handled carefully and in a tightly controlled environment because of its radioactivity, Bryce noted.",
      "Pluvicto delivers targeted ionizing radiation directly to tumor cells, with the goal of minimizing damage to healthy cells. (iStock)",
      "\"This means it is not necessarily available in every oncologist\u2019s office, and in some communities may only be available in certain practices,\" he said. \"During the initial rollout, there were manufacturing difficulties that limited availability, but that's no longer an issue.\"",
      "Each dose must be manufactured and delivered to the specific patient, Bryce said, as the isotope will decay over time and cannot be stored for future use.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "In Adams\u2019 case, Bryce said, it appears that the drug was approved, but there were scheduling difficulties.",
      "\"This may reflect limitations of the medical infrastructure in the local environment, and points to the importance of systems that are able to deliver care as quickly and efficiently as possible while maintaining safety.\"",
      "Potential side effects",
      "In clinical trials, the most common side effects of Pluvicto were fatigue, dry mouth, nausea, back pain, joint pain, decreased appetite and constipation, Novartis confirmed to Fox News Digital. These effects are usually mild to moderate.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Some patients may also notice changes in blood test results, like lower levels of blood cells or certain minerals, which doctors can monitor during treatment.",
      "In rare cases, serious side effects can include bleeding problems, infections (like sepsis), kidney injury or blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), per the FDA\u2019s prescribing information.",
      "In clinical trials, the most common side effects of Pluvicto were fatigue, dry mouth, nausea, back pain, joint pain, decreased appetite and constipation. (iStock)",
      "The medication contains a small amount of radioactive material, which means it must be handled carefully to minimize radiation exposure.",
      "Pluvicto can sometimes affect the kidneys and should not be used during pregnancy due to risk to the unborn baby, the prescribing information warns.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "\"Chemo has more systemic side effects, because Pluvicto is targeted at affected tissue only,\" Siegel said.",

A ruling against the administration would deliver a major blow to Trump's signature economic policy.",

In court filings, they pointed to laws such as Section 232 (national security trade measures) and Section 301 (retaliation for unfair trade) as times when Congress expressly gave tariff powers to the president. By contrast, IEEPA has been used for embargoes, asset freezes and licensing but never across-the-board tariffs. The last time the Court permitted a delegation of tariff powers to the president, in Algonquin SNG v. FEA (1976), it relied on Section 232 because Congress put that authority plainly in the statute. Challengers say there is no comparable language in IEEPA.",
      "The liberal justices on the Court signaled that without clear words from Congress, IEEPA cannot provide Trump with tariff authority. After a previous Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), courts no longer give federal agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting vague laws.

      "Senate Bill 12 bans drag performers from dancing suggestively or wearing certain prosthetics on public property or in front of children. Business owners could face a $10,000 fine for hosting these performances, and performers who violate the law could be slapped with a Class A misdemeanor.",
      "A three-judge panel in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on Thursday reversed an earlier decision by a district court, returning the case to the district court, according to The Texas Tribune.",
      "In Thursday's decision, the judges ruled that most of the plaintiffs, which included a drag performer, a drag production company and pride groups, were not found to have planned a \"sexually oriented performance,\" meaning they could not be harmed by the law that seeks to restrict sexually explicit dances, the outlet reported.",

      "The ruling also suggests that the court does not believe all drag shows are sexually explicit and, therefore, are not impacted by the ban.",
      "In September 2023, U.S. District Judge David Hittner ruled that the law was unconstitutional, writing that it \"impermissibly infringes on the First Amendment\" and that it is \"not unreasonable\" to believe it could affect activities such as live theater or dancing.",
      "Critics of the ban have previously argued that GOP lawmakers were attempting to label all drag shows as sexually explicit, as Republicans continue to target the performances in Texas and several other states.",

      "\"When asked whether the performers 'simulate contact with the buttocks of another person,' the owner testified that the performers sit on customers' laps while wearing thongs and one performer invited a 'handsome' male customer 'to spank her on the butt,'\" the ruling said. \"When asked whether the performers \u2018ever perform gesticulations while wearing prosthetics,\u2019 the owner testified that in 360 Queen\u2019s most recent show, a drag queen \u2018wore a breastplate that was very revealing, pulsed her chest in front of people, (and) put her chest in front of people\u2019s faces.'\"",
      "Judge Kurt Engelhardt also wrote in a footnote that there is \"genuine doubt\" that these actions are \"actually constitutionally protected \u2014especially in the presence of minors.\" He was joined by Judge Leslie Southwick, while Judge James Dennis disagreed.",
      "\"That gratuitous dictum runs headlong into settled First Amendment jurisprudence and threatens to mislead on remand,\" Dennis wrote in his partial dissent.",

      "AI TRUCK SYSTEM MATCHES TOP HUMAN DRIVERS IN MASSIVE SAFETY SHOWDOWN WITH PERFECT SCORES",
      "Waabi integrates its Waabi Driver with Volvo\u2019s VNL Autonomous, signaling a push toward safe, scalable Level 4 trucking. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "How this AI-powered autonomous truck was built for scale",
      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",
      "Nils Jaeger, President of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said the partnership is helping build the broader ecosystem needed for commercial deployment.",
      "\"Autonomy has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in the transport industry, including safety, efficiency and capacity,\" he said.",
      "The collaboration also draws strength from NVIDIA's computing platform.",
      "\"Self-driving is one of the first frontiers in which we will see physical AI become a reality,\" said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\"Our purpose-built compute platform complements Waabi's pioneering end-to-end verifiable trucking system, and it's coming to life on the VNL Autonomous. Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Volvo and Waabi say their integrated platform targets broad commercial deployment as U.S. freight demand grows. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",

This strategy makes it harder for researchers to reconstruct how infections work. Without every piece of the puzzle, the final malware payload cannot be decrypted correctly.",
      "Who's being targeted by the Russian malware",
      "ColdRiver's operations have been linked to the Russian intelligence service (FSB), with years of activity focused on espionage and data theft. The group has consistently targeted Western governments, think tanks, media organizations and NGOs to steal sensitive information and gain strategic insight.",
      "Despite sanctions, infrastructure takedowns and public exposure, the hackers continue to evolve. Their quick shift from LostKeys to NoRobot and MaybeRobot shows a highly organized and well-funded operation capable of retooling within days.",

      "These practical steps can help you protect your data and devices from the growing wave of Russian malware using fake CAPTCHA pages to spread.",
      "Fake \"I'm not a robot\" pages are the main lure in this Russian malware campaign. If you're redirected to a CAPTCHA on an unfamiliar site or after clicking a suspicious link, stop immediately. Real CAPTCHAs usually appear only on trusted websites, not random pop-ups or login pages. When in doubt, close the page and verify the URL before taking any action.",
      "Choose reputable antivirus protection that not only scans for known malware but also monitors suspicious behavior. Since the \"Robot\" malware evolves rapidly, behavior-based detection helps stop new variants before signature updates are available. Enable automatic updates and schedule daily scans to catch infections early. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.

      "The malware used in these attacks exploits known security flaws in unpatched systems. Always apply updates as soon as they're released. Turn on automatic updates for your browser, antivirus and operating system. Outdated software is one of the easiest entry points for Russian hackers and other advanced groups.",

      "A ransomware payload could be the next evolution of this malware family. Back up critical data to both an external drive and cloud storage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rise of these Russian malware campaigns is a reminder that cybercriminals are always one step ahead. What looks like a harmless \"I'm not a robot\" test can actually hide a serious threat. Protecting yourself isn't just about having antivirus software; it's about staying alert to small online details that can make a big difference. Keep your devices updated, question unexpected pop-ups, and use trusted tools to guard your personal information.

Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency. The results from Miami-Dade could influence how police departments nationwide use automation in the years ahead.

Scams involving criminals pretending to be bank representatives have surged, with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reporting record-breaking losses exceeding $2.9 billion in recent data.

      "What impostor bank scams look like",

These stories are not rare; they reflect how sophisticated and believable modern scams have become.",
      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",
      "Older adults are particularly vulnerable. The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024.

      "What's the deal with the proposed GUARD Act?",
      "Here are some of the key features of the proposed Guard Act:",
      "AI companies would be required to\u00a0verify user age with \"reasonable age-verification measures\" (for example, a government ID) rather than simply asking for a birthdate.If a user is found to be under 18, a company must\u00a0prohibit them from accessing an \"AI companion.\"The bill also mandates that\u00a0chatbots clearly disclose they are\u00a0not human and do not hold professional credentials (therapy, medical, legal) in every conversation.It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",

      "It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",
      "Bipartisan lawmakers, including Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the GUARD Act to protect minors from unregulated AI chatbots. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The motivation: lawmakers cite testimony of parents, child welfare experts and growing lawsuits alleging that some chatbots manipulated minors, encouraged self-harm or worse. The basic framework of the GUARD Act is clear, but the details reveal how extensive its reach could be for tech companies and families alike.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "Why is this such a big deal?",
      "This bill is more than another piece of tech regulation. It sits at the center of a growing debate over how far artificial intelligence should reach into children's lives.",
      "AI chatbots are no longer toys. Many kids are using them. Hawley cited\u00a0more than 70 percent of American children\u00a0engaging with these products. These chatbots can provide human-like responses, emotional mimicry and sometimes invite ongoing conversations. For minors, these interactions can blur boundaries between machine and human, and they may seek guidance or emotional connection from an algorithm rather than a real person.",
      "If this bill passes, it could reshape how the AI industry manages minors, age verification, disclosures and liability. It shows that Congress is ready to move away from voluntary self-regulation and toward firm guardrails when children are involved. The proposal may also open the door for similar laws in other high-risk areas, such as mental health bots and educational assistants. Overall, it marks a shift from waiting to see how AI develops to acting now to protect young users.",
      "Parents across the country are calling for stronger safeguards as more than 70 percent of children use AI chatbots that can mimic empathy and emotional support. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Some tech companies argue that such regulation could stifle innovation, limit beneficial uses of conversational AI (education, mental-health support for older teens) or impose heavy compliance burdens. This tension between safety and innovation is at the heart of the debate.",
      "What the GUARD Act requires from AI companies",
      "If passed, the GUARD Act would impose strict federal standards on how AI companies design, verify and manage their chatbots, especially when minors are involved. The bill outlines several key obligations aimed at protecting children and holding companies accountable for harmful interactions.",
      "The first major requirement centers on\u00a0age verification. Companies must use reliable methods such as government-issued identification or other proven tools to confirm that a user is at least 18 years old. Simply asking for a birthdate is no longer enough.The second rule involves\u00a0clear disclosures. Every chatbot must tell users at the start of each conversation, and at regular intervals, that it is an artificial intelligence system, not a human being. The chatbot must also clarify that it does not hold professional credentials such as medical, legal or therapeutic licenses.Another provision establishes an\u00a0access ban for minors. If a user is verified as under 18, the company must block access to any \"AI companion\" feature that simulates friendship, therapy or emotional communication.The bill also introduces\u00a0civil and criminal penalties for companies that violate these rules. Any chatbot that encourages or engages in sexually explicit conversations with minors, promotes self-harm or incites violence could trigger significant fines or legal consequences.Finally, the GUARD Act defines an\u00a0AI companion as a system designed to foster interpersonal or emotional interaction with users, such as friendship or therapeutic dialogue. This definition makes it clear that the law targets chatbots capable of forming human-like connections, not limited-purpose assistants.",

      "OHIO LAWMAKER PROPOSES COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON MARRYING AI SYSTEMS AND GRANTING LEGAL PERSONHOOD",
      "How to stay safe in the meantime",
      "Technology often moves faster than laws, which means families, schools and caregivers must take the lead in protecting young users right now. These steps can help create safer online habits while lawmakers debate how to regulate AI chatbots.",
      "Start by finding out which chatbots your kids talk to and what those bots are designed for. Some are made for entertainment or education, while others focus on emotional support or companionship. Understanding each bot's purpose helps you spot when a tool crosses from harmless fun into something more personal or manipulative.",
      "Even if a chatbot is labeled safe, decide together when and how it can be used. Encourage open communication by asking your child to show you their chats and explain what they like about them. Framing this as curiosity, not control, builds trust and keeps the conversation ongoing.",
      "Take advantage of built-in safety features whenever possible. Turn on parental controls, activate kid-friendly modes and block apps that allow private or unmonitored chats. Small settings changes can make a big difference in reducing exposure to harmful or suggestive content.",
      "Remind kids that even the most advanced chatbot is still software. It can mimic empathy, but does not understand or care in a human sense. Help them recognize that advice about mental health, relationships or safety should always come from trusted adults, not from an algorithm.",
      "Stay alert for changes in behavior that could signal a problem. If a child becomes withdrawn, spends long hours chatting privately with a bot or repeats harmful ideas, step in early. Talk openly about what is happening, and if necessary, seek professional help.",
      "Regulations such as the GUARD Act and new state measures, including California's SB 243, are still taking shape. Keep up with updates so you know what protections exist and which questions to ask app developers or schools. Awareness is the first line of defense in a fast-moving digital world.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The GUARD Act represents a bold step toward regulating the intersection of minors and AI chatbots. It reflects growing concern that unmoderated AI companionship might harm vulnerable users, especially children. Of course, regulation alone won't solve all problems, industry practices, platform design, parental involvement and education all matter. But this bill signals that the era of \"build it and see what happens\" for conversational AI may be ending when children are involved. As technology continues to evolve, our laws and our personal practices must evolve too. For now, staying informed, setting boundaries and treating chatbot interactions with the same scrutiny we treat human ones can make a real difference.",

      "The BBB reports that some scammers pose as charity vendors or market sellers who only accept tap payments. Once you tap your card or phone, they charge far more than the agreed amount.",

      "Invest in an RFID-blocking wallet or card sleeve to create a physical barrier between your card and potential scanners. These inexpensive tools prevent scammers from reading your card information through clothing, bags, or wallets. Look for sleeves or wallets specifically designed to block wireless communication.",
      "Always check the merchant name and transaction amount displayed on the payment terminal before tapping. Scammers often rush you to avoid scrutiny. Take an extra second to confirm what you see matches what you agreed to pay. If something looks off, cancel the transaction immediately.",
      "Enable instant transaction alerts from your bank or credit card provider. This lets you know the moment a payment is made, giving you a chance to spot unauthorized activity right away. Quick detection can prevent further charges and make it easier to dispute fraudulent transactions.",

      "Make it a habit to check your financial accounts at least once a week. Review each transaction carefully and report anything suspicious to your bank immediately. Even small unexplained charges could signal a larger problem.",
      "Most mobile wallet apps allow you to set PINs, facial recognition, or fingerprint verification before authorizing a transaction. Make sure these protections are enabled. This adds another barrier that prevents criminals from initiating payments without your consent.",
      "Regularly update your smartphone's software and mobile wallet apps. Updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities scammers might exploit. Outdated software can leave your data exposed.",
      "Stay protected from payment-stealing malware:",

The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.",

      "Criminal justice expert Michael Rushford breaks down how a felon\u2019s recent gun-related arrest is intensifying questions about leniency and public safety.",
      "A Nebraska felon whose prison sentence was reduced under a Biden administration clemency initiative is accused of possessing a gun linked to multiple crimes, intensifying scrutiny over whether reform efforts have come at the expense of public safety.",
      "Federal prosecutors say 31-year-old Khyre Holbert, who had served roughly seven years of a 20-year federal sentence for gun and narcotics offenses, was arrested after an Oct. 4 shooting in Omaha\u2019s Old Market district.",
      "Investigators allege Holbert discarded a loaded handgun fitted with a high-capacity magazine as officers closed in, a weapon later tied to several other violent crimes across Nebraska.",
      "Holbert\u2019s sentence had been commuted in January 2025 despite objections from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which warned of his gang ties, long criminal record and prior weapons convictions. Months later, he\u2019s accused of reoffending and his case has thrust former President Joe Biden\u2019s clemency program back into the national spotlight.",
      "TOP BIDEN OFFICIALS QUESTIONED AND CRITICIZED HOW HIS TEAM ISSUED PARDONS, USED AUTOPEN: REPORT",
      "Officials say Khyre Holbert, who was charged in a shooting in Omaha's Old Market earlier this month, now faces a federal firearms charge. (Omaha Police Department)",
      "Law enforcement groups have echoed that concern. The Omaha Police Officers Association blasted the decision to release Holbert, calling him \"no stranger to the law,\" while Attorney General Pamela Bondi described the case as \"a failure to hold criminals accountable.\"",
      "For Michael Rushford, founder and president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, Holbert\u2019s arrest is more than a tragedy. It\u2019s a warning.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think you can delegate clemency,\" Rushford told Fox News Digital. \"It was never intended that a president delegate that authority. I think what we saw were clemencies being granted without the president\u2019s direct knowledge. Why would he sign off on 31 drug dealers? Why would you sign off on a murderer?\"",
      "Rushford said cases like Holbert\u2019s reflect a failure in judgment and vetting during Biden\u2019s final year in office.",
      "\"With drug traffickers, especially those already convicted, this isn\u2019t their first party. It\u2019s hard to get into federal prison,\" he said. \"When you let one go, you have to realize he\u2019s going to go out and commit more crimes. The likelihood is very high. That doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\"",

      "Officials say Khyre Holbert allegedly tried to discard the weapon used in an Oct. 4 shooting in the Old Market district in Omaha, Nebraska. (X/@omahaPOA)",
      "He questioned whether Biden\u2019s Justice Department properly reviewed who was being released.",
      "\"You have to look and see if there was a real injustice in the case,\" Rushford said. \"With the Biden administration, I\u2019m not sure that was done. The Justice Department under him was not really interested in fighting crime.\"",
      "The concern extends beyond Nebraska. In March 2025, authorities in Alabama arrested Willie Frank Peterson, another Biden clemency recipient, on new drug- and gun-related charges, just months after his release.",
      "According to a federal complaint, Peterson, who had served more than a decade of a 20-year sentence, was caught with cocaine, meth and a loaded handgun. His sentence was also commuted in Biden\u2019s Jan. 17, 2025 clemency wave, which freed 2,490 inmates, mostly for drug and gun offenses, according to the DOJ Office of the Pardon Attorney.",
      "Rushford said that by the time offenders reach federal prison, most have already exhausted their \"second chances.\"",
      "BIDEN\u2019S AUTO-PEN PARDONS DISTURBED DOJ BRASS, DOCS SHOW, RAISING QUESTIONS WHETHER THEY ARE LEGALLY BINDING",
      "\"It\u2019s hard to get into federal prison,\" he explained. \"You don\u2019t just commit one crime and go, unless it\u2019s murder. Second chances have been overblown. By the time you get somebody who\u2019s got three or four convictions, the second chances are over.\"",
      "He said clemency should be narrowly used to correct genuine injustices and not as a political gesture.",
      "\"It\u2019s got to be a very specific process evaluating who\u2019s in there,\" Rushford said. \"If there was an injustice, fine. But it shouldn\u2019t be for political allies or people who gave you money. And I think that was happening under Biden.\"",
      "\"The people approving these releases,\" he added, \"weren\u2019t interested in protecting the public from criminals.\"",
      "Rushford said he expects the current administration to restore integrity to the clemency process.",
      "TED CRUZ TORCHES BIDEN FOR 'PARTISAN AND PERSONAL MOTIVES' AFTER BOMBSHELL REPORT ON AUTOPEN PARDONS",
      "\"I don\u2019t see the kind of straight criminals being let loose like Biden had done,\" he said. \"I hope the Trump Justice Department raises the integrity level and makes sure we\u2019re not letting out hardened criminals and drug traffickers.\"",
      "\"The president we have now knows what\u2019s going on,\" Rushford added. \"He has a Justice Department that\u2019s very engaged in fighting crime and reducing drug trafficking. It\u2019s a different regime making those decisions.\"",
      "Beyond clemency, Rushford blames a broader political climate that he says favors offenders over victims.",
      "\"The defund-the-police movement was an admission that they didn\u2019t want to protect the public \u2013 that their sympathies were with criminals,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a large segment of the political environment that doesn\u2019t agree criminals belong in prison.\"",
      "Rushford added that some major cities still have mayors and governors that think counselors will solve the problem.",

      "Michael Rushford criticized the defund-the-police movement and a broader political climate that he said favors offenders over victims. (Qian Weizhong/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "\"We still have mayors and governors in big cities that think we should send counselors to talk to criminals who are beating their wives with a broom handle \u2014 and that\u2019s ridiculous,\" he said. \"You need police officers to go in there and take that guy out and arrest him.\"",
      "Rushford said that attitude, combined with policies allowing repeat offenders back onto the streets, has eroded public trust and endangered communities.",
      "Rushford believes real reform only comes after tragedy.",
      "\"The last time around, one of the big triggers was Polly Klaas,\" he said. \"When they found the repeat offender who kidnapped and killed her, everybody said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to stop this.\u2019 I hate to say this, but I think it's going to be one of those horrible cases before the country wakes up.\"",
      "A California judge rejected convicted killer Richard Allen Davis' request for a resentencing hearing for his death-penalty sentence after murdering Polly Klaas in 1993. (Paul Sakuma, File/ Klaas for Kids)",
      "The 1993 murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas, kidnapped from a sleepover in Petaluma, California, by a repeat offender, led to California\u2019s \"three-strikes\" law and remains one of the state\u2019s most infamous cases.",
      "Rushford also cited recent tragedies involving repeat offenders, including Brianna Kupfer, a 24-year-old UCLA graduate student fatally stabbed while working in a Hancock Park furniture store by a man with a lengthy record, and Iryna Zarutska, a woman who was murdered on a North Carolina train, allegedly by an ex-convict with a lengthy criminal history.",
      "Shawn Laval Smith, 34, was convicted for the 2022 killing of Brianna Kupfer, 24, who was stabbed multiple times while working alone in a Los Angeles furniture shop. (KTTV/Linkedin)",
      "Rushford said these cases show \"what happens when repeat offenders keep getting another chance.\"",
      "He believes the tide is turning but says it won\u2019t happen fast.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t come this way overnight, and it\u2019s going to take a while to get rid of it,\" Rushford said. \"People who are victimized by these repeat offenders, they're not going to be comforted by the fact that in 20 years, we're going to get this straightened out.\"",

      "\"Tariffs are a multilayered issue,\" said Dawson Hobbs, executive vice president of government affairs at the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. \"The most direct one people think of is the tariffs placed on imported wine. But there are hidden aspects too, tariffs on glass, aluminum cans, labels, even glue that holds boxes together. These universal tariffs affect the entire production process and supply chain.\"",
      "Wholesalers, who buy products from producers or importers and sell them to retailers, also face increased costs. Holding inventory becomes more expensive as carrying costs rise, and those costs either need to be recouped when selling to retailers or absorbed.",

      "\"At the beginning of the year, there were tariffs threatened, then delayed, then implemented. When products take 60 to 70 days to arrive, it\u2019s very difficult to plan when you don\u2019t know what the tariff rate will be,\" Hobbs told Fox.",
      "Hobbs warned that rising costs could soon affect consumers more directly.",

      "Tariffs can affect American producers indirectly, when many components involved in wine production come from overseas.",
      "\"American wines are certainly feeling tariffs in terms of inputs, aluminum cans, glass, cardboard, glue,\" Hobbs said. \"But overall, it creates more headwinds for the industry and does not help anyone with the final experience for the consumer.\"",
      "Lucia Hossfeld, co-owner of Hossfeld Vineyards with her husband, said they are feeling the effects of tariffs on the winemaking side of the business.",

      "\"French oak barrels, the glass bottles, the cork. We\u2019ve also seen consolidation, the labeling of the wine, as well as the selling of the wine. We\u2019ve seen kind of retaliatory tariffs,\" Hossfeld said.",

      "VINEYARD OWNERS USE GOSPEL OF JOHN METAPHOR TO GUIDE WINEMAKING PHILOSOPHY",

      "The following day, he again posted that Republicans should give money directly to people\u2019s health savings accounts, which allow people to save pretax money that can be used for certain medical expenses.",

      "Bessent said any such proposal was contingent on ending the government shutdown, which on Monday will stretch into its 41st day.",

      "Bessent was also asked on ABC about Trump\u2019s proposal to give people a $2,000 tariff \u201cdividend.\u201d He said he hadn\u2019t yet spoken to the president about it, but that it \u201ccould come in lots of forms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president\u2019s agenda: no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans,\u201d he said. \u201cSo those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill.\u201d",
      "The idea of sending tariff rebate checks came up earlier this year as well.",
      "After Trump in July said he would favor sending tariff rebate checks to Americans, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill that would provide $600 checks to American adults and children using tariff revenue. The Senate has not yet taken up that bill for a vote.",

      "Democrats swept Tuesday\u2019s elections, winning by larger-than-expected margins in key races in New Jersey and Virginia. Exit polls found that voters in those states generally disapproved of Trump\u2019s job in office so far and were sour on the state of the U.S. economy.",

We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k\u2019s are Highest EVER.\u201d",
      "Still, the posts this weekend seemed to be an acknowledgment that Republicans may need to do more.",

      "President Donald Trump on Sunday became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since Jimmy Carter in 1978, appearing at the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders matchup.",
      "In the third quarter, Trump appeared on the Fox broadcast, answering questions about his time as a football player at New York Military Academy, opining on quarterbacks and more.",
      "\u201cDrew Brees, he threw a ball you could catch,\u201d was one piece of analysis Trump offered, breaking down the former quarterback\u2019s game with his ex-teammate Jonathan Vilma, who was in the broadcast booth for Fox. \u201cI would have liked him as a quarterback.\u201d",
      "The President even tried his hand at play-by-play, calling a 2nd-and-7 play for the Commanders inside the redzone.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens. Not bad,\u201d Trump said during a three-yard run by Jacory Croskey-Merritt.",
      "When asked why he enjoys attending sporting events, Trump \u2014 who was also at the Super Bowl in February \u2014 said sports is a microcosm of life.",
      "\u201cYou have the triumph and you have the problems, and you have to get through the problems to hit the triumphs,\u201d the President said.",
      "Trump\u2019s appearance at the game came on the heels of an ESPN report that the President wants the Commanders\u2019 new stadium named after him.",
      "Washington currently plays at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, which has been the team\u2019s home since 1997. The Commanders played at RFK Stadium from 1961 through 1996, winning three Super Bowls during that time period. The demolition of the stadium began earlier this year.",
      "In April, Washington owner Josh Harris, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, and Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser announced the Commanders would return to the nation\u2019s capital in a new stadium at the RFK site.

      "Young people are teaching themselves how to do nothing.",
      "On TikTok, users are challenging themselves to sit idle \u2014 no devices, no books, no music, not even food or sleep \u2014 and simply stay free of distractions for a set period of time. The videos, some of which have accrued millions of views, feature a time lapse of a person sitting expressionless in their room while a giant timer faces the camera, counting down a set period ranging from minutes to hours.",
      "The trend, dubbed \u201crawdogging boredom,\u201d appears to be the latest attempt by some Gen Zers to heal attention spans long splintered by the mindless short-form entertainment available online at every turn.",
      "Mia Ristaino, 21, posted herself partaking in the challenge for seven days, starting off with five minutes before gradually upping her time to 15 minutes. Ristaino, a college student in Fort Worth, Texas, said she was surprised at how difficult it was to sit without distractions for even a few minutes.",
      "\u201cI feel like I always have something to do or something on the TV in the background. Or a lot of times, I honestly will listen to my textbooks or record myself with my notes, and I\u2019ll play that while I\u2019m cooking or cleaning. And so whenever things are quiet, it\u2019s very weird for me,\u201d Ristaino said. \u201cI want to work on my attention span. I want to work on just being present in the moment.\u201d",
      "The NSFW origins of the term \u201crawdogging,\u201d traditionally a vulgar slang word for unprotected sex, has become an internet colloquialism for taking on a task without any preparation, assistance or distractions.",
      "The term\u2019s semantic evolution went mainstream last year, when the idea of \u201crawdogging\u201d long flights gained viral traction online. In this first iteration of what would become a running meme, many on TikTok posted about spending entire flights staring straight ahead, accompanied by nothing but their thoughts. Since then, other things people have claimed to \u201crawdog\u201d include their office jobs, the gym and even their mental health issues.",
      "Psychologist Gloria Mark, author of the book \u201cAttention Span\u201d and the Substack publication \u201cThe Future of Attention,\u201d said the trend is part of a perpetual cycle of internet users trying to free themselves from their addicting devices. The ritual is similar to mindfulness or meditation, she said, although it seems to lack the intentional focus that typically accompanies those practices.",
      "But participants aren\u2019t doing themselves any favors by framing it in a way that implies they\u2019re only enduring boredom, she said.",
      "\u201cBoredom sounds to most people like it\u2019s unbearable. When people are in solitary confinement, the punishment is actually the boredom,\u201d Mark said. \u201cI would instead frame this in a positive way and say that when you sit without your device, whether you\u2019re looking at a wall or sitting in a room, it gives you an opportunity to learn something about yourself. You can come up with ideas. You can make discoveries.\u201d",
      "If participants can look forward to an intrinsic reward \u2014 such as a greater sense of peace, an opportunity to clear their mind, or time to work through a problem they\u2019ve been thinking about \u2014 they might feel more inclined to partake without dreading the tedium of watching the clock tick down.",
      "But, she said, many might also be driven by a powerful extrinsic reward: social media recognition. There\u2019s some irony, she noted, in watching people record their digital detox and share it online.",
      "For Ristaino, who said she recognizes why posting it might seem counterintuitive, the social media challenge was a means of holding herself accountable to completing a seven-day streak and, perhaps, continuing beyond that. And it seems to have worked, as the 15-minute sessions have now become a near-daily part of her routine.",
      "They\u2019re also something of a productivity hack, she said, because leaning into the boredom leaves her more excited to then complete a homework assignment or perform other less stimulating chores. Meanwhile, sitting alone with her thoughts is no longer as intimidating as it used to be.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not scooting around like crazy on my floor anymore, and I\u2019m able to sit there and just tolerate it more,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m bored, and that\u2019s OK,\u2019 instead of being like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m bored, what am I gonna do?\u2019\u201d"

      "A photo \u2014 in which Cienega math teachers wore matching white T-shirts on Halloween stained with red blotches and reading \u201cProblem Solved\u201d \u2014 was circulating rapidly online. Right-wing influencers were claiming that the educators were mocking conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination.",

      "\u201cExcept instead of bots, it\u2019s people,\u201d he said.",
      "The deluge of threats that engulfed the district left administrators and teachers feeling helpless to stem the tide of harassment and shows how quickly social media storms can upend a small community based on a single image taken out of context and incorrectly tied to a political motive.",
      "In the eight weeks since Kirk, co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot while speaking at a college campus in Utah, conservative influencers and some Republican lawmakers have called attention to educators who make light of or justify it, leading to dozens of firings and suspensions.",
      "But in the Vail School District, no one said anything about Kirk. The only connection was an inference because the red blood-like stains were on the left side of white T-shirts that some said reminded them of how Kirk was dressed the day he was shot.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a coordinated effort, and I think people\u2019s emotions are being weaponized,\u201d Carruth said.",
      "The district, located in an unincorporated area of Pima County, 24 miles south of Tucson that  grew rapidly in recent years, has been the target of far-right extremism before. In 2021, a group of people angry about mask mandates took over a school board meeting and declared themselves as the elected leaders. One of the people involved in the takeover was later criminally charged for threatening to zip-tie a principal in a supposed citizen\u2019s arrest; he was convicted of disrupting an educational institution, trespassing and disorderly conduct, sent to jail for 30 days and placed on probation for three years.",
      "But those experiences hadn\u2019t prepared them for a controversy on this scale.",
      "The Vail School District originally posted the math teachers photo on Facebook in a batch of images from Halloween festivities late Oct. 31. It appears to have first been circulated individually in local Facebook groups devoted to town gossip before getting picked up by prominent conservative influencers on X, who continued to spread inaccurate claims about it widely.",
      "Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet tweeted at 12:06 p.m. ET Saturday that the teachers \u201cdeserve to be famous, and fired.\u201d Kolvet has since deleted the post, but it had accrued almost 10 million views on X as of Tuesday.",
      "Middleton and her staff moved quickly. They called all the teachers, and she said each denied the shirts had anything to do with Kirk or politics; they were a joke about math teachers slaying math problems, worn in the spirit of a \u201czombie run\u201d activity the student council had organized. Additionally, at least three of the teachers said they were fans of Kirk, and some had voted for Donald Trump last year. No students or parents had complained, she said.",
      "\u201cOne teacher said a kid asked him, \u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019 And the teacher looked at him and went, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s solved,\u2019 and then the whole class laughed,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cAnd I thought, oh, my God, that\u2019s math humor.\u201d",
      "At 11 a.m. ET Saturday, the district posted a statement on Facebook that explained the context for the photo, but conceded that it could be misconstrued and apologized for it.",
      "School leaders hoped things would calm down, but the backlash was just getting started.",
      "After the district issued the statement explaining the photo, Kolvet posted it on X \u2014 just more than an hour after his initial comments \u2014 adding that he\u2019d be relieved if they didn\u2019t intend to reference Kirk, but he didn\u2019t think everyone in the photo was innocent, and said teachers \u201chave been among the worst offenders of mocking and celebrating Charlie\u2019s assassination.\u201d He did not respond to an interview request.",
      "The photo only spread from there. One conservative commentator on X posted the photo alongside the names and phone numbers of the teachers. That post has received more than 20 million views.",
      "Some Republican politicians also seized on the photo.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on X that the Arizona teachers were \u201cglorifying a murder.\u201d He later posted the district\u2019s statement and said people can \u201cdecide for themselves.\u201d Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, quoted a post featuring the photo and the teachers\u2019 names and phone numbers, adding \u201cAnyone else think this might be the best advertisement ever for school choice and homeschooling?\u201d A spokesperson for DeSantis referred back to his posts. Lee\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Arizona State Treasurer Kimberly Yee, a Republican, posted on X that the shirts were bad even if they didn\u2019t intend to reference Kirk. In a statement to NBC News, she said \u201cthreats of violence against anyone\u201d are unacceptable, but that the shirts were \u201cdeeply disturbing and should also be condemned, especially when it occurs on a taxpayer-funded school campus.\u201d",
      "Others, like Ryan Fournier, co-founder of the national political group Students for Trump, refused to accept the district\u2019s explanation.",
      "Fournier, who falsely accused an elementary school administrator in September of justifying Kirk\u2019s murder, updated his post on Facebook \u2014 where he has more than 1 million followers \u2014 Saturday about the photo with the district\u2019s statement, but said, \u201cI do not believe this for one second.\u201d He did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "District officials later found an email from October 2024 that included a photo of the teachers wearing the \u201cProblem Solved\u201d shirts at that time, and released a screenshot of it. Some on social media claimed it was created with artificial intelligence or photo editing software.",
      "Arizona state Rep. Rachel Keshel, a Republican from Tucson, continued posting about it on X, stating, \u201cI\u2019m not buying his BS story one bit.\u201d She also emailed the math teachers directly asking for the original photo so she could examine the metadata, district officials said. Keshel did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hundreds of harassing emails, Facebook messages and phone calls poured in to district employees all weekend. Some were directed at the wrong math teachers \u2014 who hadn\u2019t been in the photo \u2014 and others sent to random district staff, such as maintenance workers. The personal phone numbers and addresses of teachers were circulated online. Rumors spread that there would be protests and snipers at the school Monday. A guidance counselor said a steady stream of students came into her office this week asking about their safety.",
      "One of the math teachers in the photo, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid further harassment, said he didn\u2019t know anything about Kirk until he heard Saturday that people thought he was making fun of his death. It was a stressful weekend, he said, already worried about severe weather threatening extended family abroad, and trying to calm his wife and son who were worried about the reaction to the photo. He hid in his bathroom to cry so his wife wouldn\u2019t see.",
      "\u201cNowadays, everything is scary online,\u201d he said.",
      "The math department had considered doing a group costume based on the Gen Alpha meme \u201c6-7,\u201d the teacher said, but decided to reuse the \u201cProblem Solved\u201d shirts they bought on Amazon last year because they\u2019d won a costume contest with them and they didn\u2019t want to spend more money.",
      "He, like half of the math department, stayed home Monday. When he returned Tuesday, he said, students told him they thought he was going to quit. \u201cI told them, \u2018No, I\u2019m not gonna leave you guys behind, you know, we\u2019re family.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cienega High School is surrounded by housing developments and advertisements for people to make reservations on yet to be built houses. Cacti and palo verde trees dot the neighborhood. Students on campus are just as likely to be wearing a cowboy hat as they are to have brightly-dyed hair or intricately-designed braids.",
      "Students were well-aware of the controversy but largely sided with the teachers. There were extra sheriff\u2019s deputies stationed on campus and patrolling nearby all week.",
      "As one student named Elijah, 15, stood feet away from an officer\u2019s patrol car this week, he said he wished the people posting about the teachers online understood how they affected his school. \u201cIt\u2019s making us feel uneasy and unsafe just going to school,\u201d he said.",
      "The student leaders of the Cienega High School chapter of Turning Point USA sent a letter Tuesday to the math teachers telling them they \u201chold your department in high regard.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a chapter, we recognize that emotions and tensions have run high and we cannot express enough empathy for the massive misunderstanding it has multiplied into,\u201d their message stated, according to a copy reviewed by NBC News. \u201cOur goal as a club remains as it should always be, to foster respectful and healthy conversation, not to divide or harm.\u201d",
      "A few minutes after Middleton, the principal, read the club\u2019s message that afternoon, she received another note from the front desk. A man had continuously called the school, demanded to know the names of the women answering the phone and shouted \u201care you ready to motherf-----g die?\u201d",
      "Middleton felt bad that front office staff making around $9 an hour were facing harassment for a situation they had no involvement in. The next day, she decided to send all calls to voicemail, so staff could filter and respond to parents.",
      "But the staff has also seen support. Several parents dropped off iced coffee and doughnuts Monday and Tuesday, telling them they were doing so because they felt so bad about the harassment.",
      "\u201cThis horrific loop of flinging poo and insults at others who we think disagree with us will never be broken online or via a phone call or via an email,\u201d Carruth, the superintendent, said. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to be broken by stepping out and meeting our neighbors.\u201d"

      "In a post on her Instagram story Nov. 8, Kardashian shared an update on her progress with her followers, including her bar exam results.",
      "The Skims founder, who stars in Ryan Murphy\u2019s new series \u201cAll\u2019s Fair,\u201d wrote in part, \u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m not a lawyer yet, I just play a very well-dressed one on TV.\u201d",
      "\u201cSix years into this law journey, and I\u2019m still all in until I pass the bar,\u201d she continued. \u201cNo shortcuts, no giving up \u2014 just more studying and even more determination. Thank you so everyone who has supported and encouraged me along the way so far.\u201d",

      "Kardashian has been sharing her journey to becoming a lawyer since April 2019, following in the footsteps of her late father, Robert Kardashian, who died in 2003.",
      "In an interview for Vogue\u2019s May 2019 issue, Kardashian said that she made the decision during the summer of 2018 to start a four-year law apprenticeship and aimed to take the bar exam in 2022.",
      "During the interview, she said she was inspired after she was called upon by the White House to help advise on changes to the clemency system. She said that she felt that she needed \u201cto know more\u201d being the room.",
      "\u201cI would say what I had to say, about the human side and why this is so unfair. But I had attorneys with me who could back that up with all the facts of the case,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s never one person who gets things done; it\u2019s always a collective of people, and I\u2019ve always known my role, but I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more.\u201d",
      "California is one of the four states that doesn\u2019t require a law degree in order to take the bar exam. Instead, the state allows prospective lawyers the opportunity to complete an apprenticeship with practicing attorneys instead before taking the exam.",
      "Kardashian addressed backlash to this decision on social media in April 2019, writing at the time, \u201cI want people to understand that there is nothing that should limit your pursuit of your dreams, and the accomplishment of new goals. You can create your own lanes, just as I am.\u201d",
      "The reality TV star ultimately finished her law program in six years, which she celebrated with her family back in May. The celebration included a fitting pop culture nod \u2014 a \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d-themed cake courtesy of Scott Disick that read, \u201cKim is my Lawyer.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Shay Mitchell and Esther Song just launched a new skin care line for kids, sparking conversations about the necessity of the products for children.",
      "The duo launched their new brand, Rini, on Nov. 6. Rini\u2019s launch consisted of \"everyday\" face masks in the shape of a puppy, unicorn or panda, a hydrating hydrogel facial mask and an after-sun hydrogel facial mask. The facial sheets contain ingredients like vitamin E, vitamin B12 and aloe vera.",
      "Mitchell and Song say the products are intended \"to nurture healthy habits, spark confidence, and make thoughtfully crafted daily care essentials and play products accessible to every family.\"",
      "But the launch was met with some backlash online, with some claiming the products aren't needed for children's skin and project beauty standards onto kids.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Mitchell for comment.",
      "Dermatologist Dr. Fatima Fahs tells TODAY.com, \"Kids don\u2019t really need to be using any of these ingredients.\"",
      "Fahs, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the practice Dermy Doc Institute, says kids' skin is typically balanced on its own and \"not problematic.\"",
      "\"If we\u2019re already potentially pushing the agenda that kids' skin needs to be fixed, then we\u2019re potentially highlighting imperfections for kids at a really young age. ... It\u2019s kind of blurring the lines of self-care and promoting this idea that their skin is not already perfect,\" Fahs says.",
      "What Is Rini?",
      "Shay Mitchell first teased her new company Rini on Instagram Nov. 5 by posting a photo of a child using a face mask. The company formally launched the next day.",
      "\"This has been three years in the making, inspired by my girls, their curiosity, and all the little moments that made me realize how early it starts. From birthday parties and face paint to wanting to do 'what mommy does' with her face masks\u2026 it was only a matter of time,\" Mitchell wrote on Instagram.",
      "Mitchell explained that she and her close friend and business partner Song specifically came up with the idea for the aloe vera recovery mask when they saw Song's daughter\u2019s skin after a day in the sun.",
      "\u201cI wanted something that worked, but was still clean enough for my kids and now it\u2019s finally here,\u201d Mitchell, who is a mom to 6-year-old Atlas and 3-year-old Rome, said. \u201cKids are naturally curious and instead of ignoring that, we can embrace it. With safe, gentle products parents can trust, and sweet moments that bring us closer.\u201d",
      "On Rini's website, they added that they \"created Rini because we wanted products that are gentle, trust-worthy, and inspire creativity.\"",
      "A press release for the launch said that the formulas were developed with pediatric chemists and labs in South Korea and the brand\u2019s \u201cproprietary formulas reflect the brand\u2019s \u2018rini promise\u2019 of transparency, safety, and quality to redefine play for Little Faces with Big Imaginations.\u201d",
      "Why Rini Has Sparked Some Backlash",
      "Before the company formally launched on Nov. 6, Rini \u2014 and the imagery of a young girl using a face mask \u2014\u00a0sparked controversy.",
      "\"This feels beyond GRIM,\" one person commented on the Nov. 5 post.",
      "\"I\u2019m deeply disappointed. Why are we projecting beauty standards onto children now,\" another wrote.",
      "Other commenters expressed their concerns over the marketing of skin care toward young kids.",
      "\"Their skin needs recovery from what?\" one Instagram user said.",
      "\"The only face product a child needs is sunscreen, this is wild!\" another added.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m genuinely concerned by this. kids don\u2019t need hydrogel masks or actives. their skin barrier is already healthy and still developing. this kind of \u2018early skincare\u2019 marketing really blurs the line between care and consumerism. do better,\" a third wrote.",
      "Representatives for Mitchell did not respond to TODAY.com's request for comment by the time of publication.",
      "Do Kids Need Skin Care Products? We Asked a Dermatologist",
      "Rini's website lists out the ingredients featured in the kids' skin care products. The after-sun face mask includes aloe vera and chamomile; the hydrating mask is made with vitamin B12, glycerin and red algae extract; and the \"everyday\" mask features  vitamin E, white tremella mushroom and beta-glucan.",
      "Fahs says kids' skin \"needs very basic things.\u201d Children\u2019s skin barriers are \u201calready very healthy and resilient,\" she adds.",
      "Aloe vera is a calming ingredient that can be used after sun exposure, she says. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps support the skin barrier, though she says it's not needed topically.",
      "Similarly, Fahs says that vitamin B12 is \u201cnot necessarily proven to have any topical benefits on the skin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can reduce inflammation overall, but most kids are getting vitamin B12 in their normal diet, so it\u2019s not something that necessarily needs to be applied on the skin,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "Rini was \"created for growing faces ... to hydrate, soothe and recover\" and is intended for kids ages 3 and up, according to the brand's product pages.",
      "Fahs advises parents to consider introducing a skin care routine once their kids start to show signs of puberty in their pre-teen years.",
      "At this stage, children might notice an increase in oiliness in their skin, or \u201clittle bumps on the skin toward the end of the day.\u201d Generally, this change can occur between the ages of 8 and 13, with 8 being on the earlier side, Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIntroducing a gentle cleanser, a gentle moisturizer and a broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is a great routine to encourage,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf I see patients in the office starting to have these changes, the very first thing I\u2019ll try to get them into the habit of doing is just washing their face with a gentle cleanser daily. Sometimes that\u2019s all they need.\u201d",
      "Overall, Fahs says she is seeing more marketing geared toward children, \u201cwhether that\u2019s intentional or not,\u201d and is seeing children come into her clinic \u201cwith more reactive skin barriers now or with problems they didn\u2019t have before starting a routine.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m all for healthy routines and habit building, especially in children, this almost takes it to the next level where it becomes harmful,\u201d she says.",
      "Fahs says that children's skin \u201cisn\u2019t just like a smaller version of adult skin.\u201d Rather, it is already \u201cnaturally balanced.\u201d",
      "\u201cChildren don\u2019t need these seven step routines, or these complicated products,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking to do some healthy habit building for your kids, the number one thing should just be encouraging them to wear a daily sunscreen before going outside to play.\u201d",
      "She adds, \u201cA lot of this is being disguised in this idea of self-care, but I find that self-care for children is encouraging them to go outside and play or be with their friends, and it\u2019s not standing in front of the mirror or putting on a sheet mask.\u201d"

I need you to love me.\u2019 And then it breaks into, \u2018I need you to leave.\u2019 Out of a fear that I\u2019m not going to achieve my goal, and I can\u2019t stand failing again because I fail so much. So I\u2019d rather change my goal and lie to myself than to fail miserably again,\u201d he says of James.",
      "After James\u2019 mom\u2019s funeral at the end of the first episode, he hijacks a car and goes on a rampage. He tries to call Ruby, and when she doesn\u2019t answer, his driving gets more and more out of control until he spins out and flips the vehicle.",

And healing means sometimes to fall apart and to get yourself together again and to let people go,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned and what people can learn, and we see that she has to let him go and to heal himself.\u201d"

    "summary": "Why is the Farmers' Almanac ending after 200. years? Editor Sandi Duncan explains why, plus why the Old Farmer's Almanac is still going on.",
    "story": [
      "Readers have been upset to learn that the Farmers' Almanac is ceasing publication after more than 200 years in existence.",
      "No, not that one.",
      "The Nov. 6 announcement by the staff at the Maine-based Farmers' Almanac not only caused an outpouring of support for a publication that began in 1818, but also resulted in a competing farmer's almanac putting out a statement that it is still very much in business.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac, based in New Hampshire, issued a news release on Nov. 7 clearing up any confusion by noting that it is \"still going strong.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Why Is the Farmers' Almanac Shutting Down?",
      "The Farmers' Almanac, based in Lewiston, Me., announced that it is ceasing publication due to the \"growing financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment,\" the company said in a news release.",
      "Access to existing digital content on its website will be discontinued in December.",
      "\"First we want to tell everyone that this decision was very hard to make,\" Farmers' Almanac editor Sandi Duncan told TODAY.com in an email. \"The Almanac has been published each and every year since 1818 \u2014 even when the editor (Ray Geiger) was overseas serving in World War II. And we also recognize that it\u2019s more than just a book \u2014 it\u2019s a way of life \u2014 a tradition \u2014 a resource for so many people for so many years.\"",
      "\"However, readers now access information and answers differently, and the trajectory of newsstand sales made this decision necessary,\" she continued. \"The financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment, unfortunately lead to this decision.\"",
      "The 2026 Farmers' Almanac will be the final edition of a publication that began in 1818. It features weather forecasts, astronomy tidbits and predictions like the best days to ski, brew beer, plant tomatoes and view meteor showers.",
      "Duncan, who has worked at the publication since 1994, spoke about what she hopes the legacy of the long-running publication will end up being.",
      "\"To remind people to stop and smell the roses,\" she said. \"To appreciate all the wonders of nature, to realize that there is so much we can learn from the natural world even if we live among concrete skyscrapers.\"",
      "The announcement left readers upset at the loss.",
      "\"Sadly another treasured memory will disappear but will never be forgotten,\" one person commented on the Farmers' Almanac website. \"Have read FA since I was a kid, now 70.\"",
      "\"No way! Please tell me it isn\u2019t so,\" another wrote. \"I have had the FA in my home every year since I was 19 years old. I am now in my 70\u2019s. The wit, wisdom, and weather have been like a wonderful old friend to me.\"",
      "\"Please don\u2019t go. I\u2019ve grown up with you and want to keep growing older together,\" another commented. \"Not ready for you to leave. Please reconsider.\"",
      "What Is the Difference Between the Farmer\u2019s Almanac And the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac?",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac is based in Dublin, N.H., and has been in existence since 1792.",
      "The Farmer's Almanac is based in Lewiston, Me., and was in existence since 1818.",
      "The editors of the Old Farmer's Almanac released a statement on Nov. 7 in case readers were confused thinking it was going out of business.",
      "\"You may have heard that the Farmers' Almanac, based out of Lewiston, ME, is ceasing publication after an incredible 200+ year run,\" the statement reads. \"Over the years, there has been some confusion between different almanacs, so to be clear: The OLD Farmer\u2019s Almanac isn\u2019t going anywhere. As we have since 1792, during George Washington\u2019s presidency, we will continue to publish our annual edition, while educating and entertaining readers online at Almanac.com.\"",
      "The 2026 Old Farmer's Almanac will feature new gardening books, digital tools, calculators and seasonal weather forecasts. The book also includes gardening knowledge, astronomy and folklore material.",
      "\"Rest assured, as sure as the Sun will rise, The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac \u2014 with our familiar yellow cover and 80% accurate weather forecasts \u2014 will be around for generations to come,\" the statement concluded."

      "Looking for a read to carry you through winter, or at least to Thanksgiving? Author C.J. Farley stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY on Nov. 7 to share the books that he's loving lately.",
      "Farley's next novel, \"Who Knows You by Heart,\" out Nov. 11, is a blisteringly relevant dystopia set in the world of Big Tech. Octavia Crenshaw is a coder and one of the few Black employees at the entertainment tech firm she just joined. Then she learns about the secret her company is hiding.",
      "Walter Isaacson, who wrote biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, said it was \"the first great AI novel of our time, and it is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.\u201d",
      "Read on for his book recommendations.",
      "Best thriller",
      "\"All That We See or Seem\" by Ken Liu",
      "Farley calls \"All That We See or Seem\" a \"sci-fi spin on \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"",
      "It's about a female hacker-detective searching for a missing performance artist who specializes in creating AI-enhanced dreams.",
      "\"The book is a page-turner, and the main character, Julia Z, has layers that are fascinating to see pulled back. But the ideas at the center of the book are what make it truly special,\" he says.",
      "Best romance",
      "\"An Academic Affair\" by Jodi McAllister",
      "In this romance, two academics fake a marriage so they can accept a joint appointment at a university.",
      "\"My wife Sharon reads one or more romance books a week, and my job as her husband is to keep her supplied with the best ones. Searching out great romance books for her inspired me to make the love scenes in my new novel even better,\" he says.",
      "This one stands out, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about literary academics who are aware of all the tropes in romance stories even as they struggle through them.\"",
      "\"The book also has a great message: nobody should think they are too smart or too busy to fall in love.\"",
      "Best book to screen",
      "\"Hamnet\" by Maggie O'Farrell",
      "With the movie adaptation of \"Hamnet\" out at the end of November, Farley is recommending the novel, which is about William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, grieving the loss of their son Hamnet. It's this grief that scholars believe led to the creation of \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"It takes a novelist to really fill in the blank spaces in the historical record and tell us how a guy who went through tumultuous times in his early married life channeled all that to create works like 'Hamlet,'\" he says.",
      "Best Thanksgiving read",
      "\"Simply More\" by Cynthia Erivo",
      "\"Wicked\" star Cynthia Erivo tells \"impactful, stripped-down stories about her life and family to inspire readers\" in this book, per Farley.",
      "\"Wicked: For Good\" hits theaters on Nov. 21, so get to know the woman behind the voice.",
      "What CJ's reading",
      "\"I, Medusa\" by Ayana Gray",
      "Medusa is misunderstood in this fantasy novel, which follows how a young woman became a cursed after a dalliance with the gods of Olympics.",
      "\"I love stories that find humanity in monsters and cause us to question our assumptions about who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad. The Gods in this book, like Poseidon and Athena, are vain and merciless and take advantage of people,\" he says."

      "She decided to turn the idea into a tattoo and specifically chose the typewriter font to match the \u201cdetective vibe\u201d of the show. She isn't the first to do so: Other \u201cLaw and Order\u201d fans have made videos displaying their similar tattoos.",
      "A personal dedication to the series had been brewing in Carroll\u2019s mind years before the bracelet appeared on her feed.",

      "\u201cShe cared for everybody, even the episodes where it\u2019s uncomfortable and she has to work with people that are not aligned with her politically,\u201d she notes. \u201cThe writers did such a great job of including that victims matter. How you feel about a situation doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to helping others and the victims of especially sexual assault.\u201d",

She knew exactly what it was when I said it, which just goes to show how many fans there are out there.\u201d",
      "In just 10 minutes, a tribute to \u201cSVU\u201d was permanently etched into her skin. She later showed the ink to friends and family, who she says were amused. The vice principal at her school playfully rolled her eyes and shook her head when she saw it.",

I was so happy to see that it was mostly positive.\u201d There were some critics, but she adds that many fans were impressed and laughed at the inside joke.",

And I froze. Olivia\u2019s character tells people that all the time on the show.\u201d",
      "Carroll became emotional while explaining how Olivia\u2019s repeated message that sexual assault victims are not at fault has helped her.",
      "\u201cI have to remember that people are gonna people, and all we can do is survive. Like she tells a lot of the victims on the show, the whole point was that you got out of it. You made it through to the other side. It\u2019s just an unfortunate but good connection to have with that character.\u201d",
      "She also applauds Hargitay for using her platform to speak about sexual assault, particularly the rape kit backlog.",
      "\u201cThis is real life,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cThese are real (stories). Obviously, you know the little disclaimer in the beginning, but it\u2019s still real situations. These are real events that women, especially, have to go through.\u201d"

      "When Marissa arrives at the address she assumes is Jenny's residence, another woman answers the door. She panics as she discovers the woman doesn't have Milo and the phone number that texted her about the playdate is now disconnected.",

      "In the sixth episode, Milo is returned to the police station. The child is in good spirits and asks where Carrie is. He is questioned by Detective McConville (Michael Pe\u00f1a) and tells them that he and Carrie went on \u201cvacation,\u201d that he rode in the trunk of a car and he was with a man but then never saw him again.",

That trip is significant because it's when Milo\u2019s favorite stuffed toy frog went missing. The toy was recovered the a hotel room that Carrie stayed in with Milo.",
      "Colin, who has been moving around money to pay back his debt, didn\u2019t think Milo\u2019s disappearance was connected to his situation. However, Marissa shares that his bookie, named Rob Murphy, was found murdered. Turns out Rob is Irene\u2019s ex-husband and Josie\u2019s, or \u201cCarrie\u2019s,\u201d father.",
      "Who Is Carrie, AKA Josie?",

      "In a flashback scene, it's revealed that Milo and Josie's son, Noah, were born on the same day. Josie did give birth to her baby but then got into a car accident. Nurses told her her son died, but Josie was adamant that her baby survived because she heard him crying. When finding out about Milo, she believed the hospital staff got the babies mixed up.",
      "What Happened to Josie's Baby?",
      "After Milo is returned, Josie goes to Marissa and Peter\u2019s home with a gun in her hand. Colin tries to take the gun from Josie, and she ends up shooting him. He dies.",

      "Before Josie was shot, she held up a phone with a voice recording that included Peter's secret. It turns out he was behind the baby mix up. When Josie got into the car accident, she collided with Peter, Marissa and their newborn baby.",

      "Josie had enlisted her father's help after she was unable to get Milo a fake passport.",
      "Seeing this as an opportunity to make some money, Rob is the one who ends up calling Peter about the ransom. When Kyle becomes connected to Carrie, his mugshot gets blasted by police and news outlets. Protecting his daughter, Rob shoots Kyle and doesn't tell Josie.",

      "When Marissa listens to the voice recording Josie told her about, Peter is heard revealing his secret about switching the babies to Rob. Marissa also hears Peter killing Rob.",
      "Marissa tells Peter she listened to the recording and he confesses to killing Rob and says he was the one to return Milo to the police station. He put Milo in the trunk of a car and made sure the boy didn\u2019t see or hear anything traumatizing.",
      "What Else Did Peter Lie to His Family About?",
      "Peter's brother Brian (Daniel Monks), who is disabled, finds out that Peter lied to him about being a candidate for a surgery that could help him walk again.",
      "When confronting Peter, Brian discovers (to the whole family\u2019s surprise) that Peter was actually at fault for his life-changing accident. Peter originally made it seem as if Lia was the one that accidentally injured Brian when they were kids.",
      "Peter reveals that when they were all playing, he stuck his foot out to trip Brian. It wasn\u2019t his intention to hurt his brother, but he also didn\u2019t clarify that it was his fault and not Lia\u2019s. Since the accident, Lia has blamed herself for her brother\u2019s disability and even struggled with addiction.",
      "Does Peter Get Away With Josie's Death and Secret?",
      "Yes and no. Detectives are still skeptical about how Josie died, but they can't prove that Peter killed her. Days pass and Peter informs Marissa that police have determined that Josie was killed in self defense.",
      "Over the season, Marissa and Jenny get close. In the final episode, Marissa tells Jenny the whole story and that she\u2019s scared to be with Peter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can divorce him, knowing what he can do. I\u2019m stuck, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Marissa says.",
      "At Colin's funeral, Marissa gives Peter something he is allergic to. Pretending like it was an accident, she also gives him an expired EpiPen and removes the emergency ones from their car. The ambulance is too far away and he dies.",
      "Additionally, Detective McConville, who has a neurodivergent son, discovers that Josie and Milo both had synesthesia, a \u201cphenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The first time Josie met Milo, they had bonded over being able to taste colors and see days of the week in color. McConville begins to investigate Josie, Peter and Marissa\u2019s car accident again.",
      "After Peter dies, Lia is questioned by the detectives about Marissa's involvement in his death. Weeks later, McConville visits Marissa and tells her how both Milo and Josie have synesthesia. He also gives her a chance to confess that Peter switched the babies at the accident, killed Rob and put Milo in the trunk.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you had no idea what was happening until Josephine Murphy showed up to your house with a gun and told you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know you were stuck... so you made some choices.\u201d",
      "He tells her the case is now closed, but he feels fine not getting confirmation \u2014 because he too would do anything for his child (including getting rid of criminal records to get his son into a special school)."

      "\"We worked together, which is the taboo, but where else are you supposed to meet the love of your life other than work?\" he told Jenna Bush Hager.",
      "While discussing pet names for couples, Carson admitted that he's not fond of the terms \"honey\" or \"babe\" and prefers something a bit more personal.",
      "\"We have a nickname. It's Bingo. We call each other Bingo,\" he said.",

      "\"They're really hard days. People work really hard, long hours and the vibe was really bad. And I pulled a Michael Scott (from \"The Office\") as the boss and I tried to hire a clown,\" he said. \"This is right here in New York City in Times Square and believe it or not, it's hard to find a clown for hire day of, but I did.\"",

However, Carson acknowledged that working together was a bit challenging at first way back when.",

      "Battleship, slime and Trivial Pursuit will be inducted into the class of 2025, per a press release by The Strong National Museum of Play.",
      "These three toys are currently on view at the museum, located in Rochester, New York.",
      "The top three winners were among 12 finalists that also included games like Catan, Connect Four, cornhole, Furby, scooter, snow, Spirograph, \u201cStar Wars\u201d lightsaber and Tickle Me Elmo.",
      "The modern Battleship board game was made by Milton Bradley. Inspired by a paper and pencil game, it debuted almost 50 years ago and has sold over 100 million copies.",
      "In 1979, it was one of the first board games to be computerized, and now, there are countless electronic versions to this day.",
      "\u201cBattleship has long been a household name in the board game world. Its popularity crested in 2012 when Universal Pictures and Hasbro released a movie called Battleship. The film was only very loosely based on the game, but it helped cement Battleship\u2019s place in popular culture history,\u201d said Mirek Stolee, curator of board games and puzzles at The Strong National Museum of Play, according to a press release.",
      "As for slime and Trivial Pursuit, they\u2019ve also found a decent amount of fame. Since its commercial introduction in 1976, slime has been produced by many manufacturers under different names.",

      "\u201cCountless kids enjoy creating slime on their own or adding it as an element to play with other toys. For others, it has therapeutic benefits \u2014 offering stress relief and enhancing fine motor skills,\u201d Parnett-Dwye added.",
      "Trivial Pursuit, meanwhile, challenges players to answer difficult questions about a range of topics, from entertainment to geography.",
      "As of 2023, Trivial Pursuit has sold more than 100 million copies.",
      "\u201cTrivial Pursuit\u2019s influence has spread beyond the realm of board games to game show iterations and video game adaptations,\u201d Stolee said. \u201cThe game\u2019s maker even offers a Trivial Pursuit online daily quiz, in the vein of other popular daily games like Wordle. Frequent updates and innovations continue to keep Trivial Pursuit relevant.\u201d",
      "Established in 1988, The National Toy Hall of Fame recognizes \u201ctoys that have inspired creative play and enjoyed popularity over a sustained period,\u201d per the press release from The Strong.",

    "story": [
      "The new Hulu drama series \u201cAll\u2019s Fair,\u201d which features an all-star cast led by Kim Kardashian, is making headlines for all the wrong reasons as it continues to be panned by critics.",
      "\u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d premiered its first three episodes on the streaming platform Nov. 4, introducing viewers to a group of female divorce attorneys who decide to leave their firm, run by men, and open their own practice.",
      "\u201cFierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances\u2014 both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don\u2019t just play the game\u2014they change it,\u201d the description reads. The legal drama, co-created by Ryan Murphy and his \u201cGrotesquerie\u201d collaborators Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, also stars Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash, Naomi Watts and Teyana Taylor.",
      "But despite all the talented names in front of and behind the camera, the series debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% score from critics, who wrote mostly scathing reviews about the show\u2019s plot, writing and Kardashian\u2019s performance.",
      "While critics seem aligned on their opinions of \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d so far, the audience score has been somewhat more favorable. Read on to hear what television critics and viewers have been saying about the trending series.",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "Since it arrived on Hulu, the reviews for \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d  have been overwhelmingly negative. Multiple critics have pointed out the disjointed tone and thin plot.",
      "In her review for Time, Judy Berman wrote, in part, \u201cI can say that, whether it means to be or not, 'All\u2019s Fair' is both reminiscent of some of the small screen\u2019s biggest female-focused hits and unlike anything I\u2019ve seen on TV before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not a compliment. She later described the series as \u201ca 2010s Shonda Rhimes procedural on steroid shots and Goop supplements, if everyone in the writers\u2019 room had been freshly lobotomized. 'All\u2019s Fair' is 'The First Wives Club' for psychopaths. 'All\u2019s Fair' is a multigenerational, workplace 'Sex and the City,' if the sex were all talk and the city irrelevant and the humor not necessarily intentional.\u201d",
      "New York Magazine\u2019s Vulture critic Roxana Hadadi called out Murphy in her review. \u201cAt his best, Murphy is a connoisseur of low culture, a maestro of story lines that play out at a buzzsaw pace, a sculptor of characters who spit out corrosive one-liners and gnaw through scenery, an architect of goofy sex scenes, and a mastermind at presenting exploitation as empowerment,\u201d she said. \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is cotton-candy TV: sticky, airy, and, once it\u2019s all gone, both satisfying and nausea inducing.\u201d",
      "But there were some positives, as Hadadi wrote that \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d has moments when it is reminiscent of other Murphy series like \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d and \u201cDoctor Odyssey.\u201d",
      "Kaleigh Donaldson of \u201cThe Wrap\u201d was less forgiving, labeling the show \u201cterrible\u201d before pointing out flaws in the script and Kardashian\u2019s acting.",
      "\u201cThere are lines of dialogue here so bad that one wonders if the script ever got past a sketched-out first draft on the back of a napkin. When it\u2019s not lazy exposition, it\u2019s painfully stretched attempts at gif-ready one-liners,\u201d Donaldson said. She also said Kardashian\u2019s inclusion in the series was \u201cstunt casting.\u201d",
      "Kelly Lawler of USA Today flat-out called it \u201cthe worst TV show of the year\u201d in her headline and Variety\u2019s Angie Han said it was \u201cunforgivably dull.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan gave it zero out of five stars.",
      "The one critic who wrote a complimentary review: Decider\u2019s Joel Keller, who recommended his readers stream the series. His review also bumped the show up to a 6% score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cWhen you cram a show like 'All\u2019s Fair' with so many top-notch actors (and, while Kim K. isn\u2019t exactly Watts, Nash or Close-level in the acting department, she holds her own), and then stuff each episode with cases involving huge guest stars, you can\u2019t help but make a show watchable,\u201d he said. Keller also pointed out there were comedic moments in the show that he enjoyed.",
      "He concluded, \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is over the top and campy as hell, but it also knows it\u2019s both of these things, which is why the show and the cases the firm deals with are going to be fun to watch.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "While critics voiced their opinions, hundreds of viewers commented on Rotten Tomatoes to share their thoughts, too. The audience score was mixed, hovering around 61% as of Nov. 5.",
      "One fan left a five-star review and said, \u201cPeople are such haters. Such a fun watch with great talent. Keyboard warriors and trolls seem to basing their ratings based off what they think of the Kardashians and Kim without giving merit to her actual talent, skill and dedication to every craft shes put hands on. If you know you know and if you dont know, take your hate elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Another commented, \u201cI love it, I feel it\u2019s a very clever show. I love the characters in their individuality and how they all bring a different flavor to every episode. I had expectations and I feel glad they didn\u2019t disappoint. Ryan Murphy never disappoints.\u201d",
      "A third agreed about the show\u2019s premise, writing, \u201cPersonally I think it is a powerhouse display of women and law and is very interesting and entertaining.\u201d",
      "Many said they appreciated the campy sense of humor in \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d and were looking forward to the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cAll Fair\u2019s Will Be The People\u2019s Champ! It\u2019s (what we\u2019re) missing on television. It\u2019s funny, fashion forward, campy, glamorous, and filled with shade and reads!! Reviews are being tough but I think the people will enjoy it! It\u2019s something new and original,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the reboot era.\u201d",
      "However, some agreed with the critics.",
      "One one-star review from a viewer read, \u201cAll\u2019s Fair tries to present itself as bold and provocative, but it ends up being tone-deaf and, at times, outright offensive. In the current state of the world, where empathy and awareness should be at the forefront of storytelling, the show\u2019s approach feels careless and disconnected. Instead of challenging viewers to think critically, it relies on exaggerated stereotypes and shallow shock value. What could have been a relevant commentary on justice and social dynamics turns into a spectacle that trivializes serious issues. Art has the power to provoke, but it also carries responsibility. All\u2019s Fair forgets that balance \u2014 and the result is a show that feels out of touch with the moment we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Another said that the promising concept wasn\u2019t executed properly. \u201cWhile this series boasts impeccable styling and a stellar cast, it is completely let down by the awkwardly abrupt writing, delivery, and poor direction. As a result, each scene feels (labored), and the actors showcase their unique skills at a rather jarring, manufactured and superficial level. The concept had great potential \u2014 backed by a solid budget. It is clear something wasn\u2019t working behind the scenes and, in this instance, it may cost Ryan Murphy the attention of his otherwise usually loyal audience.\u201d"

      "Bergeron was the original co-host of \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d when it premiered in 2005. He remained in the role, winning one Emmy for his work on the show, until he left the series in 2020 after he objected to the casting of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",
      "Bergeron, who was replaced at the time by Tyra Banks, said he had previously been assured no political figures would compete on the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Guys, this is exactly what we said we wouldn\u2019t do,\u2019\u201d Bergeron said of his reaction to the casting during a 2023 appearance on dancer Cheryl Burke's \u201cSex, Lies, and Spray Tans\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cAnd I would have responded the same way if they had booked Hillary Clinton, whom I voted for. \u2018Don\u2019t go there. This is, you know, not the right time. Play to our strengths. Be the show that gives people a break from all this bulls---.\u2019 So, I was furious,\u201d he added.",
      "After Spicer was cast in 2019, Bergeron posted his disapproval in a since-deleted post on Twitter, now X.",
      "\u201cA few months ago, during a lunch with DWTS\u2019 new Executive Producer, I offered suggestions for Season 28,\u201d Bergeron wrote. \u201cChief among them was my hope that DWTS, in its return following an unprecedented year-long hiatus, would be a joyful respite from our exhausting political climate and free of inevitably divisive bookings from ANY party affiliations. I left that lunch convinced we were in agreement.\u201d",
      "He said the casting decision was not his to make.",
      "\u201cIt is the prerogative of the producers, in partnership with the network, to make whatever decisions they feel are in the best long term interests of the franchise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it\u2019s their call. I\u2019ll leave it to them to answer any further questions about those decisions.\u201d"

I was 19 , already living on the streets of Vegas for 5 years, couch to couch, or with whatever boyfriend would let me stay. By then I\u2019d already lost three babies,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cAs the pics go on the eyes only get more sad, more broken & more intoxicated.\u201d",

While people talked about us, judged us, wished on our downfall, we just stayed the course and believed what God had for us no man could take away. We overcome by the blood of the lamb and the power of out testimony. TESTIFY BABY! TESTIFY!\u201d"

      "Now, bus providers in Denmark and Norway say they are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China, that is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.",
      "Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests \u201cover the air,\u201d they can be \u201cstopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,\u201d Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email Wednesday.",
      "\u201cElectric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cChinese bus concern; it is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in,\u201d Gaard added.",
      "In Denmark, Movia\u2019s fleet includes 262 Yutong buses, which have been phased in since 2019 across a network that covers the capital, Copenhagen, and the east of the country, Movia said.",
      "The alarm was first raised earlier this month by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country\u2019s public transport, including in Oslo, the capital.",
      "Ruter performed underground tests \u201cinside a mountain\u201d on two buses: the Yutong model and one from the Dutch manufacturer VDL.",
      "While the Dutch buses \u201cdo not have the capability for autonomous software updates over the air,\u201d Yutong \u201chas direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics,\u201d it said.",
      "In theory, \u201cthis bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer,\u201d it said, although Yutong wouldn\u2019t be able to remotely drive these vehicles.",
      "Asked for comment on the Danish and Norwegian moves, Yutong sent an emailed statement saying that it \u201cunderstands and highly values the public\u2019s concerns regarding vehicle safety and data privacy protection,\u201d and \u201cstrictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.\u201d",
      "It said its vehicle data in the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services data center in Frankfurt, Germany, where it is \u201cprotected by storage encryption and access control measures,\u201d and that \u201cwithout customer authorization, no one is allowed to access or operate the system.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is just the latest episode in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with China: deeply reliant on Beijing\u2019s trade and increasing know-how, but critical of its alleged cyber-aggression, rampant intellectual property theft and human rights violations.",
      "Even as hope rises for a new trade agreement between China and the E.U., there are grave concerns over plans for a new mega-embassy in London and a lingering scandal over the collapse of an alleged spying case at the heart of Westminster.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dutch government has seized control of the Chinese chipmaker Nexperia, in a saga that has raised fears that car production could come to a halt on the Continent.",
      "Even more so than the United States, European nations have relied on China for critical infrastructure \u2014 only to conclude that it poses a problem if and when relations go south.",
      "A number of European governments have torn out 5G networks made by the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE \u2014 under pressure from Washington \u2014 because of fears they could be used by Beijing to compromise Western national security.",
      "Today\u2019s hot-button issue is Chinese electric vehicles, which are effectively blocked from sale in the U.S. but whose market share is ballooning in Europe, doubling to 5.1% in the first half of 2025 from last year, according to the auto consultancy JATO Dynamics.",
      "As with other Western concerns, China has roundly rejected that its EVs and other technologies present a security risk.",
      "In January, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned American moves to block Chinese tech from the U.S. auto market, accusing it of \u201coverstretching the concept of national security\u201d and calling for Washington to \u201cstop going after Chinese companies,\u201d spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a daily news briefing.",
      "But plenty of security and intelligence officials are concerned.",
      "Western nations had \u201cthe whole problem with Huawei and 5G, and you\u2019ve now got a similar problem in Chinese electric cars: that they can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,\u201d the former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Dearlove, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",
      "\u201cSo if we have a crisis with China, they can bring London to a complete halt by reprogramming\u201d these vehicles.",
      "In reality, this is also true of any electric vehicle \u2014 including those made by Tesla, for example \u2014 and many other items reliant on internet connectivity, said Ken Munro, founder of the British American cybersecurity consultancy Pen Test Partners.",
      "In Norway, Ruter, the electric bus operator, said it had carried out several fixes, including stricter controls on future bus purchases, \u201cfirewalls\u201d to protect against hackers, and \u201ccollaborating with national and local authorities on clear cybersecurity requirements.\u201d",

      "\u201cDo we believe that China would destroy its entire export industry for vehicles, EVs or not, in order to prove a political and military point? It is within the bounds of plausibility,\u201d but the chances are \u201cincredibly small,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cIt just comes down to trust,\u201d he added."

But the Sudanese military, which it has been fighting since April 2023, has yet to agree to a truce, and the State Department has said it is still working to get both parties to agree to a pause in the fighting amid warnings from the humanitarian organizations that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",
      "While talks are ongoing, eyewitness accounts, videos shared to social media and an analysis of satellite imagery that has shown pools of blood visible from space have revealed the scale of the killing in the region and the increasing use of drone strikes by both sides as they seek to gain an advantage on the battlefield.",

      "A powerful quake rattled northern Japan Sunday evening, followed by several more temblors, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. A tsunami advisory was issued.",
      "The earthquake, with an upgraded magnitude of 6.9 and depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), struck off the coast of Iwate prefecture at 5:03 p.m. Japan time.",
      "There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, or any reports of abnormalities at the two nuclear power plants in the area.",
      "The agency issued an advisory for a tsunami of up to 1 meter (3 feet) along the northern coastal region, and subsequently said the water could reach as high as 3 meters in some spots.",
      "A tsunami of about 10 centimeters (4 inches) was detected at Ofunato city in Iwate Prefecture, Ominato port, Miyako and Kamaishi, and subsequently as high as 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the coastal area of Kuji. The tsunami that followed in Ofunato also reached 20 centimeters (8 inches), according to the agency.",

      "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s been a strange sort of prison break: no daring escapes, no Hollywood getaways \u2014 just inmates quietly released, by mistake, onto the streets of Britain.",
      "What once might have been an isolated blunder comes at an unwelcome time in a country strained by rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "One man, an Algerian sex offender, was arrested in London on Friday after being freed in error nine days earlier; another, a British national and convicted fraudster, accidentally released from the same prison shortly afterward and turned himself in on Thursday.",
      "Their cases followed the mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from a separate prison in October, which sparked a three-day manhunt before he was rearrested.",
      "At least four prisoners released in error over the past year remain at large, the BBC reports. More than 260 were wrongly released in England and Wales in the year to March, official data shows \u2014 more than double the figure the year before.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy said on X Friday that he was \u201cappalled at the rate of releases in error,\u201d and had ordered \u201ctough new release checks, launched an investigation, and started overhauling archaic prison systems.\u201d",
      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

      "Kiran, a 27-year-old financial trader who has struggled with hypothyroidism, said he \u201cdid not have a lot of expectations\u201d when it came to losing weight. But \u201cluck turned out in my favor,\u201d he said, and in six months he lost all of the 60-plus pounds he had gained a few years earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was a two-year struggle that came to an end, and I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Indians trying to lose weight are embracing drugs such as Mounjaro, which is also used to treat diabetes in a country that has been called the world\u2019s diabetes capital.",
      "The injectable medication from American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has become India\u2019s most popular drug by value since being approved in March, with over $11 million in sales in October, pharmaceutical market research firm Pharmarack said Friday.",
      "Even before India\u2019s more recent approval of Ozempic, another drug that is widely used for weight loss in the United States and other countries, there was already surging demand in the country for semaglutide, its active ingredient.",
      "Ozempic\u2019s Danish drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, says it is \u201cactively working\u201d to widen the availability of the drug, which Indian regulators have approved for diabetes but not obesity. The company also makes other semaglutide drugs that are already used for weight loss in India, including Wegovy, an injectable, and Rybelsus, which is taken orally.",
      "Demand could grow even further when the patent for Ozempic\u2019s active ingredient, semaglutide, expires next March in India, a pharmaceutical manufacturing giant where companies are eager to produce cheaper generic versions of the lucrative weight-loss drugs.",
      "The exploding popularity of the drugs has taken aback some doctors and officials, with Jitendra Singh, a government minister and physician, warning in August against the \u201cunchecked spread of disinformation\u201d through \u201cfad regimens\u201d and emphasizing the importance of lifestyle interventions such as regular yoga practice.",
      "Semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro, are GLP-1 agonists that were first developed to treat diabetes and have also been approved in many countries for the treatment of obesity. They regulate blood sugar and help slow how quickly food passes through the stomach, curbing hunger as a result.",
      "India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has over 100 million people with diabetes, or nearly 10% of its adult population, according to a 2023 study by the Indian Council of Medical Research. An additional 135 million people are prediabetic, the study found.",
      "Doctors say the situation is worsening as India\u2019s burgeoning middle class adopts a more Western lifestyle, eating more high-fat, high-sugar foods and exercising less.",
      "\u201cCompared to, say, a decade ago, there are more people now in their late 20s and early 30s who are being diagnosed with diabetes, as compared to the elderly population,\u201d said Dr. Saurav Shishir Agrawal, an endocrinologist in Noida, which is part of Delhi\u2019s capital region.",
      "\u201cThey ask us to just give them pills,\u201d Agrawal said, \u201cbut these medicines work better only when you are clubbing them with lifestyle changes.\u201d",
      "Agrawal practices at the newly built Medanta Hospital, where staff greet patients with a gentle \u201cNamaste.\u201d It is an example of the growing number of modern and high-end hospitals popping up around increasingly dense megacities such as Delhi, home to 33 million people, where diabetes has a greater hold.",
      "A monthly course of Mounjaro can cost as much as $250, the average monthly salary in many parts of India. But for more affluent Indians, a bigger deterrent is the idea of injecting themselves, said Dr. Tribhuvan Gulati, an endocrinologist.",
      "\u201cPeople get scared whenever you tell them that they\u2019re going to be on an injectable,\u201d said Gulati, who has a clinic in central Delhi.",
      "Gulati keeps a demo pen of Mounjaro in a drawer to show how easy it is to use the medicine, which just needs to be refrigerated before use.",
      "But the ease of use is also what worries Gulati and other doctors, who say many patients fail to overhaul the lifestyle and dietary habits causing or contributing to their health issues in the first place.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the causes of obesity in India, it is 90% lifestyle and 10% anything else,\u201d said Dr. Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol and head of India\u2019s National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe diet now is totally imbalanced because of free availability of food everywhere,\u201d he said.",
      "The potential gastrointestinal and other side effects from the weight-loss drugs, which in the U.S. have prompted multiple lawsuits against GLP-1 makers, give some patients pause, Gulati said. But others \u201care OK with continuing it throughout their life because they know that they won\u2019t be able to control themselves.\u201d",
      "Diabetic patients such as Moinak Pal, who has high insulin resistance, say that GLP-1 drugs have been the easiest way to lose weight.",
      "\u201cI have been fat-shamed since I was a child,\u201d said Pal, 34, a Noida-based journalist. He said he has been losing about 3 pounds a week since he started taking Mounjaro.",
      "It was \u201cextremely difficult for me to lose weight by conventional means,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of the problem, Misra said, is the lifestyle in India\u2019s sprawling and congested urban areas, where commutes can last as long as four hours round-trip. When workers get home, apps can deliver everything from food to clothes to their doorsteps in minutes.",
      "\u201cThey want quick fixes that don\u2019t involve going on a restrictive diet or daily exercise of an hour and so on,\u201d he said of some of his patients. \u201cAs a result, diabetes is everywhere. Every day I see patients who are young, who have uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes.\u201d",
      "Rajendra Nath Dixit blames nobody but himself for his health problems. The retired banker had heart bypass surgery earlier this year, and before that had been spending almost 8,000 rupees ($90) a month just on his insulin.",
      "\u201cI was fond of taking the typical Indian oily foods, samosas, chole bhature, and in the evening I would take five or six rotis,\u201d said Dixit, 66. \u201cEvery bad habit was there.\u201d",
      "In the five months since his surgery, Dixit has switched over completely to the oral semaglutide Rybelsus, is exercising more and is consuming less fat and sugar. He is spending 11,000 rupees ($125) a month on Rybelsus, but has been able to stop using insulin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m feeling very good, very light,\u201d he said. \u201cMy confidence has gone up, and my life has totally changed.\u201d"

      "He added: \"Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to do it.\"",
      "On Sunday, his energy secretary, Chris Wright, told Fox News that \"these will be nonnuclear explosions\" that would develop \"sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.\u201d",
      "Given the seemingly conflicting public statements from officials in Washington, Russia was \"not entirely clear about the United States\u2019 future actions and steps regarding the conduct or nonconduct of nuclear weapons tests,\" Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu told the meeting.",
      "For his part, Putin has often rattled the nuclear saber since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He has warned Western nations not to intervene in the conflict, suggesting he would not be afraid to use Moscow's arsenals were they to do so.",
      "Last month, he said that Russia had conducted the first hourslong test of a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable cruise missile capable of evading U.S. missile defenses. In response, Trump said he had a nuclear submarine \u201cright off their shores.\u201d",
      "According to the Norwegian government, the missile, the the Burevestnik, was launched from Novaya Zemlya, an archipelago off the northern coast of Russia. Belousov referred to this site again on Wednesday.",
      "\"The readiness of the forces and assets at the central test site on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago allows for\" nuclear tests to be implemented \"within a short timeframe,\" he said."

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian troops have launched helicopter raids and counteroffensives to try and ease the pressure on a key eastern city, as the Kremlin seeks a crucial battlefield victory with the U.S. push for peace shelved.",
      "Street battles were being fought in Pokrovsk, a transport and supply hub whose capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger nearby cities. It would also hand Vladimir Putin new leverage at a delicate diplomatic moment, with the Russian leader set on capturing the entirety of the broader Donetsk region.",
      "Putin's forces have been battling to take Pokrovsk for more than a year, but now appear on the verge of a breakthrough with the front lines in the city increasingly blurred.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Ukrainian troops should surrender to save themselves, claiming they were \"trapped\" by Russian forces in the city, which was once home to some 60,000 people but is now largely deserted and destroyed.",
      "It said that Russian troops were advancing further northward into Pokrovsk, blocking multiple Ukrainian attempts to break out of encirclement.",
      "Ukraine's military insisted Wednesday that there was \"no encirclement of our units and formations\" in Pokrovsk. Units defending the city had been reinforced, it said, as Russian forces tried to \"infiltrate and accumulate.\"",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield accounts from either side.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troops Tuesday in nearby Dobropillia, where Ukrainian forces are staging a counteroffensive to try and draw Russia\u2019s focus.",
      "However, Ukrainian military officials and soldiers on the ground have conceded that the situation in Pokrovsk is increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cThe situation is difficult,\u201d Sgt. Liana Kononchuk of the Ukrainian unit operating in Pokrovsk, told NBC News via WhatsApp this week. \u201cWe are trying to control it. But, unfortunately, it has only been getting worse lately,\u201d the 31-year-old said.",
      "\u201cAs of now there is no permanent line of defense as such,\u201d she said. \u201cThe enemy seeps northwards by one, two, three units at a time, thereby trying to erode the frontline,\u201d Kononchuk added.",
      "Her comments match the assessment of the Ukrainian open-source mapping project Deep State. Its latest map showed that Russian forces had pushed further into the city from the south but that most of the area remained a contested gray zone controlled by neither side.",
      "Ukraine has deployed additional resources in a bid to hold back the Russian assault, including a special forces operation using U.S.-made Black Hawk helicopters to restore supply routes, according to a spokesperson for the 7th Rapid Response Corps that is leading the defensive effort.",
      "Kononchuk hopes that these reinforcements will stabilize the situation. \u201cThe logistics situation is now very complicated. Rotating positions is hard, and evacuating the wounded is even harder,\u201d she said.",
      "The Ukrainian commander overseeing defense of the city, Col. Yevhen Lasiichuk, said via WhatsApp on Monday that Moscow\u2019s claims of an encirclement were false and part of Russia\u2019s propaganda \u201cgame.\u201d",
      "Lasiichuk said that there were between 200 and 300 Russian soldiers inside the city.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to push through the town to block key logistic points,\u201d he added.",
      "Lasiichuk stressed that, although complicated, Ukraine was still able to reach its troops in Pokrovsk.",
      "\u201cOur Defense Forces units have recently carried out airborne landings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis certainly does not look like an encirclement.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that its troops had repelled a Ukrainian special forces landing and killed all 11 soldiers who arrived by helicopter.",
      "Influential Russian military bloggers have reported the heavy use of drones and smaller mobile units to disrupt Ukrainian defenses.",
      "While the exact situation on the ground remained unclear, military analysts said that losing Pokrovsk would be a bitter blow for Ukraine as it pushes for greater U.S. support.",
      "\"The loss of Pokrovsk would make Ukrainian logistics on this front complicated, increase the risk of losing or retreating from nearby positions, and require a restructuring of the defensive lines,\" Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian colonel now working for the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, said in an interview.",
      "Pokrovsk would be Russia\u2019s most important territorial gain since it took the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024. Its capture could cause a \u201cdomino effect,\u201d but would still be a limited strategic gain unlikely to shift the overall balance of the war, Kevliuk said.",
      "Other experts said it could bolster Putin's bargaining hand after Trump called off a planned summit and imposed new sanctions on Russia last month.",
      "\"Moscow could also try to use any battlefield gains to pressure Ukraine at the negotiating table and persuade Trump to accept Russia\u2019s terms,\" Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an interview.",
      "\u201cUkraine is in a difficult position. Politically, it is hard to withdraw from territory \u2014 especially when the enemy is trying to turn local military successes into broader strategic and diplomatic victories,\u201d said Bielieskov, who is also a senior analyst at Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization.",
      "But, he said, in practical terms keeping hold of the area was now \u201cextremely challenging.\u201d",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, and Elmira Aliieva from London."
