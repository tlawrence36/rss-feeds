      "The Alamo has acquired Pee-wee Herman's iconic bike from the 1985 film \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure.\"",
      "It took 40 years, but Pee-wee's bike is now at the Alamo. Just not the basement.",
      "The Alamo announced last week it had acquired and would display the iconic bike from the 1985 Tim Burton film, \u201cPee-wee's Big Adventure.\u201d",
      "The San Antonio landmark plays a key role in the film chronicling Pee-wee Herman's search for his stolen bicycle when a devious fortuneteller tells him the bike is located in the Alamo's basement. Pee-wee, played by the late Paul Reubens, learns the Alamo doesn't have a basement, but hasn't stopped tourists from tongue-in-cheek inquiries.",
      "\u201cIt's the most common question our guest services team hears is, \u2018Where is the basement at the Alamo?'\u201d said Jonathan Huhn, senior communications director for the Alamo Trust, Inc., the nonprofit organization that oversees the Alamo's operations. \u201cIt's an iconic piece of Alamo pop-culture history.\u201d",
      "The red-and-white bike \u2014 or as Pee-wee calls it in the movie, \u201cthe best bike in the whole world\" \u2014 is adorned with streamers on the handlebars and a lion emblem at the front. Huhn said it was acquired from an auction in Los Angeles.",
      "The bike will serve as a centerpiece in the Mays Family Legacy Gallery, which examines the the Alamo\u2019s cultural impact, part of a new visitor center and museum slated to open in fall 2027. It will join other pop culture items including memorabilia from the 1960 movie about the Alamo that starred John Wayne.",
      "\u201cIt's really a pop culture bridge\" that will bring people to learn about the Alamo's history, Huhn said.",
      "But before then, the bike will go on display for a limited time at the Ralston Family Collections Center. The Alamo also plans to host a free public screening of \u201cPee-wee's Big Adventure\u201d in Plaza de Valero. More details about dates for the display and the screening will be released later.",
      "Unlike the Alamo, the building where Pee-wee's bike will eventually be located does have a basement. But, before you ask, that's not where the bike will be.",

      "Jimmy Buffett's widow, Jane Buffett, has asked a Florida judge to remove her late husband's financial adviser, Richard Mozenter, as cotrustee of his $275 million estate",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Buffett \u2019s widow has accused her late husband\u2019s financial adviser of failing to administer the singer\u2019s multimillion-dollar trust in good faith and ignoring what she believed were her best interests for the $275 million estate.",
      "Jane Buffett on Monday asked a judge in West Palm Beach, Florida, to stop Richard Mozenter from trying to remove her as a trustee and instead sought an order removing him from overseeing the estate, according to court papers.",
      "Jimmy Buffett, who popularized beach bum soft rock and created a \u201cMargaritaville\u201d empire of restaurants and resorts, died Sept. 1, 2023, at 76.",
      "His widow and Mozenter have since been embroiled in a battle over who controls the trust, with each accusing the other of mishandling funds in lawsuits filed in both California and Florida.",
      "The dispute is similar to another going on with the estate of another beloved singer, Tony Bennett. Two of the late crooner\u2019s daughters sued their brother over his handling of the family trust.",
      "Jane Buffett's filing on Monday accuses Mozenter of \u201crepeatedly\u201d breaching his fiduciary duty by failing to provide her with basic information about the trust's assets and its investments while taking \u201cunreasonable fees and costs in the context of the services provided.\u201d",
      "On May 30, Jane Buffett's lawyers provided Mozenter's lawyers a copy of a petition they planned to file in Los Angeles Superior Court if he did not resign as cotrustee by June 2, the filing states.",
      "Mozenter's counsel instead filed a petition June 2 in West Palm Beach, seeking Buffett's removal as cotrustee, documents show. Jane Buffett's complaint was filed June 3 in Los Angeles, where Mozenter is managing director at Gelfand, Rennert and Feldman LLC.",
      "\u201cNotably, Mr. Mozenter only brought this (and his other) retaliatory, baseless action after Mrs. Buffett had informed him that, absent his resignation, she would initiate litigation against him to seek his removal as co-trustee,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "Mozenter claimed in his lawsuit that Jimmy Buffett established the trust with Mozenter as an independent trustee because he was concerned about his wife's \u201cability to manage and control his assets.\u201d",
      "The complaint filed Monday in Florida says the relationship between Jane Buffett and Mozenter is \u201cuntenable,\u201d and asks the judge to remove Mozenter as cotrustee.",
      "\u201cJane will not play into Mr. Mozenter\u2019s hands by litigating this dispute in two separate courts across the country, which would drain the very trust money that Jimmy specifically set aside for her care,\u201d said attorney Matt Porpora.",
      "\u201cInstead, Jane is bringing the fight to Florida, where she and Jimmy called home. Jane is confident she will prevail regardless of where her claims are heard, and her decision to move her claims from California to Florida illustrates that she is the only co-trustee looking to conserve \u2014 not waste \u2014 trust assets,\u201d Porpora said.",
      "Mozenter did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",
      "Taylor said the festival is a door opener for the athletes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gateway for athletes to share their art, do their art and be creative without anyone questioning them,\u201d said Taylor, director of \u201cBlack and Blue,\u201d \u201cThe Intruder, \u201cMeet the Blacks\u201d and \u201cFatale.\u201d A former basketball player in East Germany turned independent filmmaker, he said true artistry requires neither a film school nor a Hollywood pedigree.",
      "\u201cThe greatest artists are the ones that draw, create, build, shoot in the face of negativity and who paint pictures of what they see in the times that they live in,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cYou can only do that if you live in this culture. You can do that if you've lived and experienced it. You can't do that from a high-rise building with no pain. These guys come from adversity in life and sports.\u201d",
      "EverWonder Studio president Michael Antinoro certainly thinks so, and then some. He sees the film festival as more than a one-off spectacle in Las Vegas.",
      "In Antinoro's eyes, it could become the Oscars of athlete-driven storytelling with satellite versions popping up in the NBA arenas throughout the season. He sees value in helping standout projects secure the final funding and reach the right distributors.",
      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",
      "\u201cThat was the power of storytelling, the unity of sports and bringing people together in community,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the idea. These are the stories people need to see. They need to be out there in the world.\u201d",

      "John Oliver brought his quirky humor to minor league baseball with the debut of the Erie Moon Mammoths",
      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun. I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d Moon said. \u201cFrom all those years ago to today, I would never have thought anything like this would\u2019ve been possible. The newspaper did something on its 30th anniversary (in 2021). Other than that, I haven't heard much.\u201d",
      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "Renowned conductor Roger Norrington, known for his historically informed performances, has died at 91",
      "Roger Norrington, a conductor acclaimed for historically informed performances during more than a half-century leading orchestras in Europe and the United States, has died. He was 91.",
      "Norrington died Friday at his home, his son Tom said Saturday. Norrington lived outside Exeter, England.",
      "Norrington conducted both period-instruments and modern orchestras, asking both types to play without vibrato and usually at faster tempi than modern practice.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary dramatist. He made things happen emotionally,\u201d Myron Lutzke, an Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s cellist who helped persuade Norrington to become music director, said Saturday. \u201cHe had his detractors, certainly, and some of them were some of my best friends. But for me, he got the music off the page. He made the concert experience transformative.\u201d",
      "Born on March 16, 1934, Norrington was the son of Arthur, president of Trinity College, Oxford, and the former Edith Carver. A violinist and boy soprano in his youth, Roger attended The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Westminster School, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music, where he studied under conductor Adrian Boult.",
      "In 1962, Norrington founded the Sch\u00fctz Choir, originally dedicated to the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. He became music director of Kent Opera from 1969-84, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta from 1985-89 and New York's Orchestra of St. Luke's from 1990-94.",
      "He was principal conductor of Camerata Salzburg from 1997 to 2006, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2011 and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra from 2011-16.",

Smoking is now going, so maybe vibrato will too. ... I have discovered, all the way from Monteverdi to Mahler, is that when music is played as it should be, the sound is wonderful, the expression is wonderful and the instruments match together.\u201d",
      "Norrington was nominated for four Grammy Awards and won in 2001 for a recording of Nicholas Maw's Violin Concerto with Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonic. Norrington retired after conducting the Royal Northern Sinfonia in an all-Hadyn concert on Nov. 18, 2021.",

      "The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction have filed dueling lawsuits after an onstage scuffle last year prompted the cancellation of the band's tour",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell's onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, prompting the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",
      "\u201cWith a series of swift blows, he single-handedly destroyed the name, reputation, trademark, and viability of the Band and those who built it,\u201d their lawsuit says.",
      "Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture. They became a national phenomenon with hits including \u201cJane Says\u201d and \u201cBeen Caught Stealing,\u201d and through their founding of the Lollapalooza tour, whose first incarnations they headlined in 1991.",
      "The group broke up soon after but returned several times in various incarnations. The 2024 tour was the first time the original members had played together since 2010.",
      "Farrell missed all seven of the group's rehearsals in the run-up to the tour, his bandmate's lawsuit alleges, and his behavior during the early shows ranged from erratic to out-of-control.",
      "\u201cHe struggled night to night amid public concern for his well-being and apparent intoxication,\u201d their lawsuit says. \u201cPerry forgot lyrics, lost his place in songs he had sung since the 1980s, and mumbled rants as he drank from a wine bottle onstage.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says Farrell was given many solutions to the volume problem, none of which he followed.",
      "Then on Sept. 13 at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston in front of about 4,000 fans, videos partially captured Farrell lunging at Navarro and bumping Navarro with his shoulder before taking a swing at the guitarist with his right arm. Navarro is seen holding his right arm out to keep Farrell away before Farrell is dragged away.",
      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda is using the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of *Hamilton* to support nonprofits providing immigration services",
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda plans to use the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of his award-winning cultural phenomenon \u201cHamilton\u201d as a fundraiser for a coalition of nonprofits providing immigration services.",
      "The Aug. 6 performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre is expected to raise about $3 million for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, 14 nonprofits ranging from the Hispanic Federation and National Immigration Law Center to the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the Tahirih Justice Center. The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",
      "Miranda did exclusively reveal some plans for the special, invite-only \u201cHamilton\u201d anniversary show and the preshow reception that he will host. Fans already know the possibilities after the special \u201cHamilton\u201d medley at the Tonys in June. Even the audience will be \u201cstacked,\u201d he said, since every actor who has ever performed during the show's Broadway run will be invited to be in the audience to watch the show\u2019s current Broadway cast that night. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something special for the curtain call and another nice special thing after that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the invites have gone to winners selected from a Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated at least $10 to the Immigrants coalition. A few dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, will be available Thursday through the Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going to the coalition.",
      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",
      "And the organizations that will benefit from the donations generated by the \u201cHamilton\u201d 10th anniversary, better known as #Hamilten, say the donations and encouragement are sorely needed now.",
      "Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved to make good on \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d promises from his campaign. His administration has encouraged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport people quickly, even to countries where they have never been, in order to rein in illegal immigration.",
      "Hispanic Federation President and CEO Frankie Miranda, no relation to Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he is heartened by the more than 125,000 people who have donated to the \u201cHamilton\u201d fundraiser. \u201cI think it is the beginning of what could be an incredible movement of philanthropy and individual donors basically saying, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen it also in the different demonstrations of people around the country where they are expressing their concern and their frustration out in the streets.\u201d",
      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He has also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from the Trump administration. \u201cWe need bold ideas like \u2018Hamilton\u2019 where everybody feels that they can stand behind it,\u201d he said.",
      "Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, another coalition member, said the donations would help her group continue to provide community legal services to individuals, while also pursuing lawsuits like its challenge to the Trump executive order seeking to strip away birthright citizenship from some children born in the United States.",
      "\u201cAt this time, when so many people are afraid to speak out and support vulnerable communities, Lin-Manuel Miranda being willing to use the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 platform just shows real leadership and bravery,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping that more donors will step up and support our sector. We are the firewall between authoritarianism and democracy.\u201d",
      "Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said her nonprofit plans to use the donations from the coalition to support its Defending Democracy initiative, which informs immigrants of their rights and uses the law as \u201ca bulwark against unconstitutional actions carried out by this administration.\u201d",
      "Matos sees it as a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment to use funding generated by \u201cthe story of one of our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers who himself was an indigent immigrant, who through his own grit, determination and his brilliance, worked his way up.\u201d \u201cHe was somebody who thought deeply about this new nation\u2019s democracy,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat better way to honor Hamilton and to express our gratitude for these resources?\u201d",
      "For Lin-Manuel Miranda, the fact that people remain fascinated by \u201cHamilton\u201d 10 years later also leaves him feeling grateful.",
      "And he remains surprised by the resonance of the line \u201cImmigrants: We get the job done,\u201d a line shared in the show by Hamilton and French military officer Marquis de Lafayette at the Battle of Yorktown.",
      "\u201cI thought it was no big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from the moment it was performed on stage, the audience reaction was so joyous at just the utterance of that simple fact. It\u2019s one of the things that just heartens me and gives me hope. In these dark times, it still gets a big cheer.\u201d",
      "The cheering still requires the show to add extra measures of music to wait for the audience to calm down before continuing with the song \u201cYorktown.\u201d Miranda attributes it to the fact that so many Americans are only one or two generations away from an immigrant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason why that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered the military parade happening on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who believe in basic decency and treating people who come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.\u201d",

      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",

      "Nathan, from Arkansas, first encountered K-pop through his Texas-based cousins who were longtime fans. \u201cI would kind of just pretend to be a hater, like urgh, K-pop. And then I just so happened to come across EXO\u2019s \u2018Growl\u2019 music video on YouTube,\u201d he recalled.",
      "The group\u2019s diverse backgrounds are reflected in their training, which includes courses on global citizenship. \u201cWe want to be inclusive of everyone\u2019s history, everyone\u2019s current situations back home,\u201d Kenny explained.",
      "Seok expressed excitement about connecting with international fans, particularly in America. \u201cSince I came from North Korea, it\u2019s hard to see foreigners there. So I really wanted to see people from other countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The group has already gained traction online. Seok described filming emotional video diaries during difficult early training days, which fans responded to with supportive messages.",

      "At a recent launch party for Nora Dahlia's enemies-to-friends romance \u201cPick-Up\u201d at Lovestruck Books, a romance-dedicated store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a crowd of women sipped cocktails from the bar-caf\u00e9 as they browsed the shelves.",
      "After Dahlia\u2019s reading, patrons stuck around to mingle, swap contact info and trade author recommendations.",
      "It was a particularly social event for a book talk. But the communal atmosphere is typical of events for romance fans.",
      "Dahlia likened romance readers to \u201cComic-Con folks,\u201d referring to the deep-rooted passion that defines comic-book fandom.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re educated on the genre in a real way,\u201d Dahlia said. \u201cMany of them started reading romance \u2014 Danielle Steel, V.C. Andrews, Jude Deveraux \u2014 as teenagers.\u201d",
      "At The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, manager Katherine Zofri said romance fans who have connected online frequently come into the store to meet in person. Along with author events, the store hosts three different book clubs and a romance comedy night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple proposals here, we\u2019ve had a wedding here which was really fun,\u201d Zofri said.",
      "She said customers range \u201cfrom teenagers who are starting to really get into the romance genres to older folks who have been romance readers for their entire lives and remember way back when they were reading the Harlequins and romance wasn\u2019t as widely accepted.",
      "\"Now they\u2019re loving seeing how widely accepted romance has become.\u201d",
      "Bookstores like Lovestruck and The Ripped Bodice (which has a flagship store in Los Angeles) have begun popping up all over the U.S., from Wichita, Kansas, to Wilmington, North Carolina, to Hopkinsville, Kentucky.",
      "Of the 157 romance-dedicated bookstores in the American Booksellers Association, more than half opened within the last two years, said Allison Hill, CEO of the trade group for independent sellers.",
      "\u201cRomance books have been one of the fastest growing book sales categories in recent years, driven by a number of factors including the need for escape reading and BookTok,\u201d Hill said.",
      "And the genre has evolved. \u201cThe romance genre is more diverse in every way including character identity and plot,\u201d she said.",
      "Lovestruck's owner, Rachel Kanter, called the boom \u201cincredible \u2014 and honestly, overdue. Romance has always been one of the most commercially successful genres, but for a long time it didn\u2019t get the respect or space it deserved in the literary world.\u201d",
      "Romance-specific bookstores, she says, \"are places where readers can feel joy, comfort, and connection \u2014 and where love is taken seriously as a literary theme.\u201d",
      "As with many hobbies, romance fandom solidified and expanded after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic had pushed so many people toward reading for escape and comfort, and romance became a lifeline for a lot of folks,\u201d said Kanter.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, there was a wider cultural shift happening \u2014 people were rethinking what mattered, craving joy and softness, and looking to support indie businesses that reflected their values. Romance, with all its hope and heart, met that moment beautifully,\" she said.",
      "Romance has countless subgenres \u2014 hockey romance, Western romance, LGBTQ romance, even romance set on prison planets. But a common theme is their \u201cinherently hopeful storylines,\u201d says Elizabeth Michaelson Monaghan, a 52-year-old freelance writer and editor in New York who said she\u2019s read \u201chundreds\u201d of romance novels.",
      "\u201cRomance must have a happily-ever-after \u2014 or at least a happily-for-now. Romance writers and readers are very clear on this,\u201d she said.",
      "Romantic fiction that doesn\u2019t end that way? That\u2019s just a love story.",
      "Traits of the romance genre also include strong character descriptions, attraction, conflict, and a satisfying resolution and emotional growth. Expect plenty of steam \u2014 some authors deploy it explicitly, others are more tame.",
      "There\u2019s a long-standing culture of (mostly) women reading and sharing these books across generations.",
      "\u201cIt is pleasurable to reimagine courtship or the romantic bond,\u201d said Jayashree Kamble, professor of English at LaGuardia Community College and president of the International Association for the Study of Popular Romance. \u201cThere is limited risk involved.\u201d",
      "Kamble has been a voracious romance reader since her teenage years in India, where she devoured Harlequin romances.",
      "Romance novels, she said, are \u201ca lovely reminder that individualism and companionship can go together. These are basic bonds.\u201d",
      "Podcasts, too, have become a source for discovering what's trending. Andrea Martucci, creator and host of the romance-focused \u201cShelf Love\u201d podcast, said romance bookstores have become places of connection akin, in some ways, to churches \u2014 for the romantically devoted.",
      "\u201cI can go to a bookstore and not just find people who love books,\u201d she said, \u201cbut find people who love the very same books I love.\u201d",
      "As Annabel Monaghan, author of several love stories including \u201cNora Goes Off Script,\u201d puts it, \u201cPeople who read romance want to feel good. And when you gather a bunch of people who want to feel good, it\u2019s magic.\u201d",

      "Bands behaving badly",
      "Bands behaving badly? It's only rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "Members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell\u2019s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here\u2019s a look at a few very famous cases.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell\u2019s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: It hasn't been; it's just getting started. Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: How much time do you have? The late, great Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 leader, feuded with his cousin and bandmate Mike Love over songwriting credits dating back decades. Love had sued Wilson several times, beginning in the 1990s.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor \u2014 except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson\u2019s partnership.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band\u2019s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam\u2019s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance. He said in a statement that the lawsuit was not about money, but that he wanted an apology and for Oasis fans \u201cto know the truth\u201d \u2014 that laryngitis prevented him from performing.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit was dropped.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The post-breakup decades of Creedence Clearwater Revival were marked by so much legal and personal infighting that you might think CCR stands for Conflict, Clash, Repeat. In 1996, singer-songwriter-guitarist John Fogerty sued ex-bandmates Doug Clifford and Stu Cook for performing under the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren\u2019t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A federal court merged the two cases, and the resulting hybrid was settled under confidential terms in 2017.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Fleetwood Mac and feuds are practically synonymous. Breakups and divorces between members are essential to some of their best songs. The conflict resumed in the 2010s when the band kicked lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham off their 2018 tour, and he sued. Buckingham claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that January that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: At some point, two key members of Journey stopped believin' in each other. And all over an Amex. Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A judge in 2024 appointed a custodian over the band's financial decisions, specifically empowered to settle disagreements between Schon and Cain.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: In 2023, Daryl Hall sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that Oates' plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged long before. The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit and arbitration are ongoing.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Their artistic partnership had been over for months, but the Beatles had to break out the barristers to break up their business. Paul McCartney went to London\u2019s High Court of Justice in 1970 to dissolve the Fab Four's 1967 contractual partnership, which included the Apple record label. McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. \u201cThe only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,\u201d McCartney told British GQ in 2020, \u201cwas to sue the band.\u201d",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as \u201cThe Beatles Agreement\u201d was signed by all four members in 1974.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",
      "The affair transcends violins and piccolos. NPR received support Thursday from the heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar the Berserker posted a call on social media for fans to pay attention to what is going on with public media.",
      "Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",
      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",
      "Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. \u201cDone in Florida,\u201d DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be defunded.",
      "Back in Alaska, KMXT public radio station\u2019s general manager, Jared Griffin, called the Senate vote a \u201cdevastating gut punch.\u201d He estimated that the cuts would amount to 22% of KMXT\u2019s budget. Griffin said the station\u2019s board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he\u2019s taking a 50% pay cut.",
      "The station covers Kodiak Island, home to one of the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.",
      "\u201cWe have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. \u201dAt least for the next year we\u2019ll be fine but we\u2019re probably going to have to look at leasing space in our building to other organizations to help fill that gap.\u201d",
      "Unalaska resident Nikki Whittern said KUCB plays a vital role in the community during emergencies like the tsunami warning.",
      "\u201cThey broadcast everything, and they make sure that everybody knows and everybody\u2019s safe,\u201d said Whittern, a bartender. She spoke while preparing to open the Norwegian Rat Saloon \u2014 known to local fishermen simply as \u201cthe Rat\u201d \u2014 on Thursday morning.",

      "\u201cThe bullwhip is the iconic symbol of an iconic character of cinema history, Indiana Jones, and has been a highlight of this auction,\" Joe Maddalena, Heritage\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement to The Associated Press.",

      "Long thought lost, the sled is one of three of the prop known to have survived. Dante stumbled on it when he was filming on the former RKO Pictures lot in 1984. He wasn\u2019t a collector, but knew the value of the sled and quietly preserved it for decades, putting it as an Easter egg into four of his own films.",
      "Dante's friend and mentor Steven Spielberg paid $60,500 for another of the sleds in 1982, and anonymous buyer paid $233,000 for the third in 1996.",

      "The countdown to Lee Corso\u2019s final appearance on ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d will kick off when the longtime analyst and former coach is honored at the ESPYS on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique opportunity we have to weave him into the evening and really begin the process of sending him off with full honors,\u201d ESPN\u2019s president of content Burke Magnus said. \u201cTo get him there in person to acknowledge all of his contributions and what he\u2019s meant to both the company and sports, but more importantly the fans, we just think it\u2019s a fitting way to kick off his departure.\u201d",
      "Kirk Herbstreit, Desmond Howard and Pat McAfee will give their thoughts about Corso before a video tribute airs. Corso will then have a couple of minutes to be acknowledged by the crowd at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.",
      "Corso \u2014 the lone remaining member of the show's original cast who turns 90 in August \u2014 announced earlier this year that his final show would be on the opening week of the season. ESPN last month revealed the 39th season of \u201cGameDay\u201d would begin in Columbus, Ohio, before defending national champion Ohio State hosts the Texas Longhorns on Aug. 30.",
      "Corso's popular headgear segment started at Ohio State on Oct. 5, 1996, before the Buckeyes faced Penn State. Since then, he has gone 286-144 in 430 selections wearing everything from helmets and mascot heads to dressing up as the Fighting Irish leprechaun from Notre Dame, the Stanford tree and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. He has worn 69 different school\u2019s mascot headgear.",
      "His television career withstood a stroke in 2009 that left him unable to speak for a while. Even though his appearances on the road have decreased in recent seasons, he was in Atlanta in January for the College Football Playoff national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame.",
      "\u201cWith the popularity and cultural phenomenon that \u2018GameDay\u2019 became, there\u2019s no one more responsible for that than Lee Corso. The way he changed the way the game was covered with the irreverence, the humor, the lack of a filter, all of those things that sort of set the tone and the standard,\" said \u201cGameDay\u201d host Rece Davis.",

      "The new \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d revives the 1997 slasher with a mix of nostalgia and new faces",
      "The new \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d pretty much follows the plot of the 1997 film of the same name: A bunch of well-to-do young people get stalked and killed by a vengeful killer in a rain slicker with an ice hook. It even has some of the same stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",
      "That line deserves a big laugh from a so-called \u201clegacy sequel\u201d that blends old and new to resurrect a franchise long dormant but isn\u2019t sure where it sits in 2025. A wink here, an eye-gouging there.",
      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",
      "The new installment follows a group of post-high school friends (Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Sarah Pidgeon and Tyriq Withers) who cause a fatal car wreck on July Fourth and swear to keep their involvement a secret. But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",
      "In fact, you may find yourself rooting for the killer. The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",
      "No matter: We get the scene when a scared victim with a massive knife sticking out of her back shoots a harpoon gun at the hook killer, and that's why we came in the first place. We also get Hewitt screaming her catchphrase, mocking her attacker: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Well, what are you waiting for?",
      "\u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody horror violence, language throughout, some sexual content and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Coldplay's concert at Gillette Stadium on Wednesday took an unexpected turn when a couple caught on the jumbotron sparked debate online",
      "LONDON -- It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his \u201cJumbotron Song,\u201d when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on.",
      "At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted.",
      "But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy,\u201d Martin joked.",
      "But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work.",
      "The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity.",
      "But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer \u2014 in other words, the head of human resources.",
      "A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a \u201cfake from a clearly labeled parody account.\u201d The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees.",
      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",
      "A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment.",
      "It\u2019s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It\u2019s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films.",
      "The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: \u201cWhen you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.\u201d",
      "In the internet age, such videos \u2014 or ones taken on someone's smartphone \u2014 can quickly zip around the world.",
      "This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera.",
      "Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that the CEO's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \"We are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",

Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",
      "Peter Lemongello Jr., a singer and performer who called Francis a friend, posted a TikTok in May where he sang the song to Francis, what he wrote on Facebook was \u201cone of the greatest and most exciting moments of my career so far.\u201d The video garnered over 15 million views.",
      "\u201cThere are no words to express this monumental loss,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cI will be forever grateful to her for the help she gave me with my career.\u201d",
      "Ian Paget, a TikTok creator, posted a tearful video Thursday and said he hopes Francis and her family \u201chave felt that love from the younger crowd learning who she is.\u201d",
      "The TikTok popularity of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962. Bruce Resnikoff, president and CEO of UMe, wrote in a statement that the global catalog division was saddened but took \u201ccomfort in knowing how joyful and fulfilled she felt in these last few months, as a new generation discovered her music and celebrated her legacy.\u201d",
      "In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for \u201cthe wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception\u201d in a Facebook post.",
      "As for her reaction to having a \u201cviral hit\u201d? She continued: \u201cClearly out of touch with present day music statistics terminology, my initial response was to ask: 'What\u2019s that?' Thank you everyone!\u201d",

      "The Steve Miller Band has canceled its U.S. tour, citing extreme weather as a safety concern for fans and crew",
      "Classic rocker Steve Miller has canceled his U.S. tour because he said severe weather including extreme heat and unpredictable flooding poses a danger to his band, its fans and crew.",
      "The tour was set to kick off in August and run through early November, with nearly three dozen stops across the U.S. including cities in New York, Tennessee, Florida and California.",
      "\u201cThe combination of extreme heat, unpredictable flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and massive forest fires make these risks for you our audience, the band and the crew unacceptable,\u201d Miller, 81, said in a statement posted on the band's social media accounts Wednesday. \u201cYou can blame it on the weather. ... The tour is cancelled.\u201d",
      "The Steve Miller Band, formed in California in the 1960s, has hits including \u201cThe Joker\u201d (1973) and \u201cAbracadabra\u201d (1982).",
      "A band spokesperson declined to provide additional details about the cancellation.",
      "Miller's decision comes as a stretch of extreme weather in the U.S. has made headlines. A sweltering heat dome that baked much of the eastern half of the nation in June and deadly flash flooding in Texas are some of the recent rounds of extreme weather.",
      "Scientists say climate change is fueling extreme weather, causing storms to unleash more rain and sending temperatures soaring to dangerous heights, making it harder to plan outdoor summer events. The atmosphere can hold higher amounts of moisture as it warms, resulting in storms dumping heavier amounts of rain compared to storms of the past.",
      "Music festivals have recently encountered extreme weather, resulting in cancellations or causing concertgoers to become ill.",
      "In June, the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Tennessee was canceled partway through due to heavy rainfall. Last week, hundreds of people were treated for heat-related illnesses at the Rock the Country music festival in Kentucky, according to local officials.",
      "A study published in 2020 reported climate change will increase the likelihood of extreme heat stress during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California.",
      "Tropical storms and hurricanes will soon contribute to the turbulent weather as activity peaks between August and October, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",

      "Planned Parenthood has won a partial victory in a legal fight with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over its efforts to defund the organization in tax legislation",
      "BOSTON -- Planned Parenthood won a partial victory Monday in a legal fight with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over efforts to defund the organization in his signature tax legislation.",
      "A provision in that bill ends Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, even to those like Planned Parenthood that also offer things like contraception, pregnancy tests and STD testing.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston granted a preliminary injunction Monday that, for now, blocks the government from cutting Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood member organizations that either don\u2019t provide abortion care or didn\u2019t meet a threshold of at least $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in a given year.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many Planned Parenthood organizations and clinics would continue to get Medicaid reimbursements under that decision and how many might not.",
      "Planned Parenthood said in a statement after the injunction that it's thankful the court recognized \u201cthe harm\u201d caused by the bill. But it said it's disappointed that some of its members will lose this funding, \u201crisking chaos, confusion, and harm for patients who could now be turned away when seeking lifesaving reproductive health care.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe court has not yet ruled on whether it will grant preliminary injunctive relief to other members,\u201d the statement added. \"We remain hopeful that the court will grant this relief. There will be nothing short of a public health crisis if Planned Parenthood members are allowed to be \u2018defunded.\u2019\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was filed earlier this month against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its member organizations in Massachusetts and Utah.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that allowing the provision to take effect would have devastating consequences nationwide, including increased rates of undiagnosed and untreated sexually transmitted diseases and cancer.",
      "\u201cWith no reason other than plain animus, the law will prevent Planned Parenthood Members from providing vital \u2014 indeed, lifesaving \u2014 care to more than one million patients,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis statute is unconstitutional and will inflict irreparable harm on Planned Parenthood Members and their patients.\"",
      "Lawyers for the government argued in court documents that the bill \u201cstops federal subsidies for Big Abortion.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll three democratically elected components of the Federal Government collaborated to enact that provision consistent with their electoral mandates from the American people as to how they want their hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent,\u201d the government wrote in its opposition to the motion.",
      "The government added that the plaintiffs \u201cnow want this Court to reject that judgment and supplant duly enacted legislation with their own policy preferences. ... That request is legally groundless.\u201d",
      "Hours after the lawsuit was filed, Talwani issued a temporary restraining order that prevented the government from enforcing the cuts. That order had been set to expire Monday.",

      "Three Democratic-led states that led the way in offering free health care to low-income people who are in the U.S. without legal permission are either limiting or ending the programs because of significant budget concerns",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For nearly 20 years, Maria would call her sister \u2014 a nurse in Mexico \u2014 for advice on how to manage her asthma and control her husband\u2019s diabetes instead of going to the doctor in California.",
      "She didn\u2019t have legal status, so she couldn\u2019t get health insurance and skipped routine exams, relying instead on home remedies and, at times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted on using only her first name for fear of deportation.",
      "Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. Maria and her husband signed up the day the program began last year.",
      "\u201cIt changed immensely, like from Earth to the heavens,\u201d Maria said in Spanish of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program. \u201cHaving the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.\u201d",
      "At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. But three of them have done an about-face, ending or limiting coverage for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally in California, Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The programs cost way more than officials had projected at a time when the states are facing multibillion-dollar deficits now and in the future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care to save an estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants in Minnesota no longer have access to the state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California, no one will automatically lose coverage, but new enrollments for adults will stop in 2026 to save more than $3 billion over several years.",
      "Cuts in all three states were backed by Democratic governors who once championed expanding health coverage to immigrants.",
      "The Trump administration this week shared the home addresses, ethnicities and personal data of all Medicaid recipients with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Twenty states, including California, Illinois and Minnesota, have sued.",
      "Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially the fear of being arrested or deported, is having a chilling effect on people seeking care. And states may have to spend more money down the road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care and end up needing to go to safety-net hospitals.",
      "\u201cI feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you\u2019ll burst,\u201d Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "People who run free and community health clinics in California and Minnesota said patients who got on state Medicaid programs received knee replacements and heart procedures, and were diagnosed for serious conditions like late-stage cancer.",
      "CommunityHealth is one of the nation\u2019s largest free clinics, serving many uninsured and underinsured immigrants in the Chicago area who have no other options for treatment. That includes the people who lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended its Health Benefits for Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.",
      "One of CommunityHealth\u2019s community outreach workers and care coordinator said Eastern European patients she works with started coming in with questions about what the change meant for them. She said many of the patients also don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t have transportation to get to clinics that can treat them. The worker spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Health Finders Collective in Minnesota's rural Rice and Steele counties south of Minneapolis serves low-income and underinsured patients, including large populations of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they\u2019re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year.",
      "Free and community health clinics in all three states say they will keep serving patients regardless of insurance coverage \u2014 but that might get harder after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decided this month to restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.",
      "CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said she always worried about the stability of the program because it was fully state funded, \u201cbut truthfully, we thought that day was much, much further away.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die. Some people are going to go untreated,\u201d Alicia Hardy, chief executive officer of CommuniCARE+OLE clinics in California, said of the state's Medicaid changes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the humanity in the decision-making that\u2019s happening right now.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health said ending the state\u2019s program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending in the short term, but she acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care at hospitals.",
      "Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican, said the state's program was not sustainable.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about trying to be non-compassionate or not caring about people,\" she said. \"When we looked at the state budget, the dollars were not there to support what was passed and what was being spent.\u201d",
      "Demuth also noted that children will still have coverage, and adults lacking permanent legal status can buy private health insurance.",
      "Health care providers also are worried that preventable conditions will go unmanaged, and people will avoid care until they end up in emergency rooms \u2013 where care will be available under federal law.",
      "One of those safety-net public hospitals, Cook County Health in Chicago, treated about 8,000 patients from Illinois\u2019 program last year. Dr. Erik Mikaitis, the health system\u2019s CEO, said doing so brought in $111 million in revenue.",
      "But he anticipated other providers who billed through the program could close, he said, adding: \u201cThings can become unstable very quickly.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers said California\u2019s Medi-Cal changes stem from budget issues \u2014 a $12 billion deficit this year, with larger ones projected ahead. Democratic state leaders last month agreed to stop new enrollment starting in 2026 for all low-income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining on the program will have to pay a $30 monthly fee in 2027.",
      "States are also bracing for impact from federal policies. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the recently signed massive tax and spending bill include a 10% cut to the federal share of Medicaid expansion costs to states that offer health benefits to immigrants starting October 2027.",
      "California health officials estimate roughly 200,000 people will lose coverage after the first full year of restricted enrollment, though Gov. Gavin Newsom maintains that even with the rollbacks, California provides the most expansive health care coverage for poor adults.",
      "Every new bill requires a shift in Maria's monthly calculations to make ends meet. She believes many people won\u2019t be able to afford the $30-a-month premiums and will instead go back to self-medication or skip treatment altogether.",
      "\u201cIt was a total triumph,\u201d she said of Medi-Cal expansion. \u201cBut now that all of this is coming our way, we\u2019re going backwards to a worse place.\u201d",
      "Fear and tension about immigration raids are changing patient behavior, too. Providers told the AP that, as immigration raids ramped up, their patients were requesting more virtual appointments, not showing up to routine doctor\u2019s visits and not picking up prescriptions for their chronic conditions.",
      "Maria has the option to keep her coverage. But she is weighing the health of her family against risking what they\u2019ve built in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d Maria said of her decision to remain on the program. \u201cIf it comes to the point where my husband gets sick and his life is at risk, well then, obviously, we have to choose his life.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed how his son and several close friends benefited from using psychedelics to deal with grief and other issues.",
      "A number of veterans lobbying for psychedelic access have already met with Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is positive,\u201d Collins told House lawmakers in May.",
      "But some experts worry the hope and hype surrounding psychedelics has gotten ahead of the science.",
      "Philip Corlett, a psychiatric researcher at Yale University, says bypassing rigorous clinical trials could set back the field and jeopardize patients.",
      "\"If RFK and the new administration are serious about this work, there are things they could do to shepherd it into reality by meeting the benchmarks of medical science,\" Corlett said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "As officials in Washington weigh the future of psychedelics, some states are moving ahead with their own projects in hopes of nudging the federal government. Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.",
      "And last month, Texas approved $50 million to study ibogaine, a potent psychedelic made from a shrub that's native to West Africa, as a treatment for opioid addiction, PTSD and other conditions. The research grant \u2014 the largest of its kind by any government \u2014 passed with support from the state's former GOP governor, Perry, and combat veterans, some who have traveled to clinics in Mexico that offer ibogaine.",
      "Ibogaine is on the U.S. government\u2019s ultra-restrictive list of illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates in Texas are hoping to build a national movement to ease restrictions on researching its use.",
      "\u201cGovernmental systems move slowly and inefficiently,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard of Americans for Ibogaine, a group formed with Perry. \u201cSometimes you find yourself constrained in terms of the progress you can make from within.\u201d",
      "Ibogaine is unique among psychedelics in both its purported benefits and risks. Small studies and anecdotal reports suggest the drug may be able to dramatically ease addiction and trauma. It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",
      "Some veterans who have taken the drug say the risks can be managed and ibogaine\u2019s healing properties go far beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling and other standard treatments.",
      "Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia and mood swings after 13 years as a Navy Seal. In 2017, at the urging of his wife Amber, he agreed to try ibogaine as a last resort. He described his first ibogaine session as \u201ca complete purge of everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut afterward I felt the weight just completely off my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more anxiety, no more depression, life made sense all of a sudden.\u201d",
      "A nonprofit founded by the Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, has helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad to receive ibogaine and other psychedelics.",
      "But federal scientists have looked at the drug before \u2014 three decades ago, when the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies on using it as an addiction treatment. The research was discontinued after it identified \u201ccardiovascular toxicity.\"",
      "\u201cIt would be dead in the water,\u201d in terms of winning FDA approval, longtime NIDA director Nora Volkow said.",
      "But Volkow said her agency remains interested in psychedelics, including ibogaine, and is funding an American drugmaker that's working to develop a safer, synthetic version of the drug.",
      "\u201cI am very intrigued by their pharmacological properties and how they are influencing the brain,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cBut you also have to be very mindful not to fall into the hype and to be objective and rigorous in evaluating them.\u201d",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "Data from the Education Department shows the pace at which it resolves civil rights complaints has slowed as the Trump administration dismantles the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists it hasn\u2019t wavered in its duty to protect the civil rights of America\u2019s children even as it dismantles the Education Department. Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch lost nearly half its staff amid mass layoffs in March, raising questions about its ability to address a deep backlog of complaints from students alleging discrimination based on disability, sex or race. Pressed on the issue in June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied a slowdown.",
      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",
      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m watching children suffer like they\u2019ve never suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no accountability.\u201d",
      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared the way for the agency to continue mass layoffs and outsource some functions to other agencies. McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible. In a June court order pausing the termination of Office for Civil Rights employees, a federal judge in Boston said the branch is \u201ccurrently incapable of addressing the vast majority\u201d of complaints. More than 200 of the office\u2019s employees remain on leave while that case is decided.",
      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those, the vast majority involve complaints of discrimination based on disability, with smaller numbers based on sex or race. Most of the sex discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes out of women\u2019s sports, one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\"OCR will continue to meet its statutory responsibilities while driving to improve efficiency and resolve the longstanding backlog,\u201c Hartman said.",
      "Multiple workers in the office who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said caseloads have grown too big to manage. In last year\u2019s budget request, the office said it was becoming difficult to keep up when investigative staff averaged 42 cases per person. Some estimates put the current caseload beyond 200.",
      "The employees said it means more cases will languish.",
      "Another parent in Michigan, Casie Clouse, hasn\u2019t heard from the department since she filed a complaint in May. Her son, Brady, who is blind in one eye and has a learning disability, wasn\u2019t getting the type of help his school promised, including access to teachers\u2019 notes and reduced coursework. Brady, 14, made no academic progress in eighth grade, and he\u2019s now heading to high school without the support he needs, his mother said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been so frustrating not to even have an update at all,\u201d said Clouse, of Ann Arbor. \u201cHe is going to go to high school and fail. I feel like my child will not get a high school diploma if he stays in Ann Arbor Public Schools.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand access to the lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies \u2014 advances that could help recover would-be heart donations that too often go unused.",
      "The new research aims to overcome barriers for using organs from someone who dies when their heart stops. Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.",
      "Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they\u2019ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.",
      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",
      "Vanderbilt\u2019s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor\u2019s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.",
      "That \u201creplenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,\u201d Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. \u201cOur view is you don\u2019t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.\u201d",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.",
      "Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.",
      "Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation\u2019s deceased donors \u2014 but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.",
      "That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.",
      "\u201cInnovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,\u201d he said.",
      "If alternatives pan out, \u201cI absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP.\u201d",

      "The removal of 21 children from a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family",
      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",
      "\u201cThe first place typically is the matching program that matches the surrogate with an intended parent. But in this situation the intended parents were the matching program,\u201d Wald said. \u201cI am not familiar with any other prior case where that was true.\u201d",
      "Arcadia police said the six children who were not at the couple's home were found with family friends. The couple's house was \u201cset up for a school environment,\u201d Lt. Kollin Cieadlo said.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were accused of neglect and arrested in May. Charges were not formally pursued at that time in order for an abuse investigation to continue, and detectives now believe there were other instances of abuse, Cieadlo said.",
      "A 2-month-old infant with a traumatic head injury, allegedly at the hands of a nanny, remains in a hospital in stable condition, he said.",
      "California law requires child welfare agencies to prioritize placing children who cannot safely be with their parents in homes with extended family, and requires siblings to be kept together unless it would endanger the child to do so, said Leslie Heimov, the executive director of the Children\u2019s Law Center of California.",
      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",
      "It\u2019s more complicated to find foster homes for larger families that can accommodate all the children\u2019s needs, especially for infants, Heimov said.",
      "In addition to expenses and limited space, it's hard to give infants the proper stimulation and care they need if they are in a home with many other children, she said.",
      "In cases involving many children, the state will sometimes get creative to make sure that siblings can maintain relationships with each other, like placing them in the same neighborhood, or placing them in different but related households, Heimov said.",
      "A case involving over 20 children conceived through surrogacy would \u201cpresent some legal questions,\u201d said Heimov. \u201cBut it would not change our advocacy \u2014 we want every child we represent to be in a loving, safe home.\"",

      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",
      "In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country\u2019s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.",
      "Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it's impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.",
      "\u201cCurrently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,\" Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. \u201dWhether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.\"",
      "For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, \u201cin which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d",
      "But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.",
      "Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.",
      "She said the diagnosis \u201cturned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.\u201d Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter\u2019s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.",

      "The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing for hours over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland.",
      "Russia now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record.",
      "Some experts say that number could soon top 1,000 a day.",
      "The spike comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has given Russia until early September to reach a ceasefire or face new sanctions -\u2013 a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible on Ukraine.",
      "Russia has sharply increased its drone output and appears to keep ramping it up. Initially importing Shahed drones from Iran early in the 3 1/2-year-old war, Russia has boosted its domestic production and upgraded the original design.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry says it's turning its drone force into a separate military branch. It also has established a dedicated center for improving drone tactics and better training for those flying them.",
      "Russian engineers have changed the original Iranian Shahed to increase its altitude and make it harder to intercept, according to Russian military bloggers and Western analysts. Other modifications include making it more jamming-resistant and able to carry powerful thermobaric warheads. Some use artificial intelligence to operate autonomously.",
      "The original Shahed and its Russian replica \u2014 called \u201cGeran,\u201d or \u201cgeranium\u201d \u2014 have an engine to propel it at 180 kph (just over 110 mph). A faster jet version is reportedly in the works.",
      "The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted that cooperation with China has allowed Russia to bypass Western sanctions on imports of electronics for drone production. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence estimates that Russia receives up to 65% of components for its Geran drones from China. Beijing rejects the claims.",
      "Russia initially launched its production of the Iranian drones at factory in Alabuga, located in Tatarstan. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production.",
      "A report Sunday by state-run Zvezda TV described the Alabuga factory as the world's biggest attack drone plant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a war of drones. We are ready for it,\u201d said plant director Timur Shagivaleyev, adding it produces all components, including engines and electronics, and has its own training school.",
      "The report showed hundreds of black Geran drones stacked in an assembly shop decorated with Soviet-style posters. One featured images of the father of the Soviet nuclear bomb, Igor Kurchatov, legendary Soviet space program chief, Sergei Korolyov, and dictator Josef Stalin, with the words: \u201cKurchatov, Korolyov and Stalin live in your DNA.\u201d",
      "The Russian military has improved its tactics, increasingly using decoy drones named \u201cGerbera\u201d for a type of daisy. They closely resemble the attack drones and are intended to confuse Ukrainian defenses and distract attention from their more deadly twins.",
      "By using large numbers of drones in one attack, Russia seeks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and keep them from targeting more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles that Moscow often uses alongside the drones to hit targets like key infrastructure facilities, air defense batteries and air bases.",
      "Former Russian Defense Ministry press officer Mikhail Zvinchuk, who runs a popular war blog, noted the Russian military has learned to focus on a few targets to maximize the impact. The drones can roam Ukraine's skies for hours, zigzagging past defenses, he wrote.",
      "\u201cOur defense industries\u2019 output allows massive strikes on practically a daily basis without the need for breaks to accumulate the necessary resources,\u201d said another military blogger, Alexander Kots. \u201cWe no longer spread our fingers but hit with a punching fist in one spot to make sure we hit the targets.\u201d",
      "Ukraine relies on mobile teams armed with machine guns as a low-cost response to the drones to spare the use of expensive Western-supplied air defense missiles. It also has developed interceptor drones and is working to scale up production, but the steady rise in Russian attacks is straining its defenses.",
      "Despite international sanctions and a growing load on its economy, Russia\u2019s military spending this year has risen 3.4% over 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which estimated it at the equivalent of about $200 billion. While budgetary pressures could increase, it said, the current spending level is manageable for the Kremlin.",
      "Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered to the military last year, said President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Frontelligence Insight, a Ukraine-based open-source intelligence organization, reported this month that Russia launched more than 28,000 Shahed and Geran drones since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, with 10% of the total fired last month alone.",
      "While ballistic and cruise missiles are faster and pack a bigger punch, they cost millions and are available only in limited quantities. A Geran drone costs only tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 a fraction of a ballistic missile.",
      "The drones' range of about 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) allows them to bypass some defenses, and a relatively big load of 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of explosives makes them a highly effective instrument of what the Center for Strategic and International Studies calls \u201ca cruel attritional logic.\u201d",
      "CSIS called them \u201dthe most cost-effective munition in Russia\u2019s firepower strike arsenal.\"",
      "\u201cRussia\u2019s plan is to intimidate our society,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that Moscow seeks to launch 700 to 1,000 drones a day. Over the weekend, German Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding said in an interview that Russia aims for a capability of launching 2,000 drones in one attack.",
      "Along the more than 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, short-range attack drones have become prolific and transformed the fighting, quickly spotting and targeting troops and weapons within a 10-kilometer (6-mile) kill zone.",
      "Russian drone units initially were set on the initiative of midlevel commanders and often relied on equipment purchased with private donations. Once drones became available in big numbers, the military moved last fall to put those units under a single command.",
      "Putin has endorsed the Defense Ministry\u2019s proposal to make drones a separate branch of the armed forces, dubbed the Unmanned Systems Troops.",
      "Russia has increasingly focused on battlefield drones that use thin fiber optic cables, making them immune to jamming and have an extended range of 25 kilometers (over 15 miles). It also has set up Rubicon, a center to train drone operators and develop the best tactics.",
      "Such fiber optic drones used by both sides can venture deeper into rear areas, targeting supply, support and command structures that until recently were deemed safe.",
      "Michael Kofman, a military expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russian advancements have raised new defensive challenges for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainian military has to evolve ways of protecting the rear, entrenching at a much greater depth,\u201d Kofman said in a recent podcast.",

    "story": [
      "The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu is living with the daily realities of climate change, as intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion reshape its coasts and disrupt life",
      "PORT VILA, Vanuatu -- When John Warmington first began diving the reefs outside his home in Vanuatu\u2019s Havannah Harbor a decade ago, the coral rose like a sunken forest \u2014 tall stands of staghorns branched into yellow antlers, plate corals layered like canopies, and clouds of darting fish wove through the labyrinth.",
      "\u201cWe used to know every inch of that reef,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a friend.\u201d",
      "Now, it\u2019s unrecognizable. After Cyclone Pam battered the reef in 2015, sediment from inland rivers smothered the coral beds. Crown-of-thorns starfish swept in and devoured the recovering polyps. Back-to-back cyclones in 2023 crushed what was left. Then, in December 2024, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake shook the seabed.",
      "What remains is a coral graveyard \u2014 bleached rubble scattered across the seafloor, habitats collapsed, life vanished. \u201cWe\u2019ve come out of the water in tears,\u201d said Warmington, who has logged thousands of dives on this single reef. \u201cWe just see heartbreak.\u201d",
      "That heartbreak is becoming more common across this Pacific island nation, where intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion are reshaping coastlines and threatening daily life. Since 1993, sea levels around Vanuatu\u2019s shores have risen by about 6 millimeters (.24 inches) per year \u2014 significantly faster than the global average \u2014 and in some areas, tectonic activity has doubled that rate.",
      "On Wednesday, Vanuatu will get its day in the world\u2019s highest court. The International Court of Justice will issue an advisory opinion on what legal obligations nations have to address climate change and what consequences they may face if they don\u2019t. The case, led by Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries, is seen as a potential turning point in international climate law.",
      "\u201cSeeing large, polluting countries just continue business as usual and not take the climate crisis seriously can get really sad and disappointing,\u201d said 16-year-old climate activist Vepaiamele Trief. \u201cIf they rule in our favor, that could change everything.\u201d",
      "The opinion won't be legally binding, but could help shape future efforts to hold major emitters accountable and secure the funding and action small island nations need to adapt or survive.",
      "It comes after decades of frustration for Pacific nations who\u2019ve watched their homelands disappear. In Tuvalu, where the average elevation is just 2 meters (6.6 feet), more than a third of the population has applied for a climate migration visa to Australia. By 2100, much of the country is projected to be under water at high tide. In Nauru, the government has begun selling passports to wealthy foreigners \u2014 offering visa-free access to dozens of countries \u2014 in a bid to generate revenue for possible relocation efforts.",
      "\u201cThe agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,\u201d said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s minister for climate change. \u201cThey're definitely not being met according to what the science tells us needs to happen.\u201d",
      "Vanuatu has already sought opinions from other international courts and is pushing for the recognition of ecocide \u2014 the destruction of the environment \u2014 as a crime under the International Criminal Court. \u201cWe have to keep fighting till the last bit,\u201d Regenvanu said.",
      "For children in Vanuatu, climate change isn\u2019t a theory \u2014 it\u2019s a classroom, or the lack of one.",
      "At Sainte Jeanne D\u2019Arc school on Efate Island, elementary school teacher Noellina Tavi has spent two of the last three years teaching her students in tents \u2014 first after the 2023 cyclones and again following the 2024 earthquake.",
      "With a shortage of emergency tents, her class was combined with another. Students fidget and lose focus. \u201cIt\u2019s too crowded,\u201d Tavi said. \u201cWe can\u2019t work peacefully.\u201d",
      "When it rains, the tents turn cold and muddy. Tavi often sends students home so they don\u2019t get sick. Anytime a storm approaches, the tents must be dismantled, the furniture carried to shelter and the children sent home. \u201cThat disrupts their education for a whole week,\u201d she said.",
      "In rural areas, extreme weather hits something even more basic: food security. On Nguna Island, farmer Kaltang Laban has watched cyclones wipe out the banana, cassava and taro crops that feed his community.",
      "\u201cAfter a cyclone, we would have nothing for months,\u201d he said. Now, with support from Save the Children, Laban and other farmers are storing preserved fruits and vegetables in a facility beside their gardens. \u201cBut not every community has this,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 70% of Vanuatu\u2019s population lives in rural areas and depends on small-scale farming.",
      "In 2025, USAID cut funding for a rainwater harvesting initiative designed to improve water access at cyclone evacuation centers in one of the country\u2019s most remote, drought-prone provinces, said Vomboe Shem, climate lead for Save the Children Vanuatu. The materials had already been shipped and distributed, but the project was halted.",
      "\u201cThese disasters are happening over and over again,\u201d Shem said. \u201cIt\u2019s pushing our communities to their limits.\u201d",
      "Not all of these impacts can be pinned solely on climate change, said Christina Shaw, CEO of the Vanuatu Environmental Science Society. Coastal development, tectonic sinking, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and pollution are also contributing to ecosystem decline.",
      "\u201cVanuatu\u2019s environment is quite fragile by its inherent nature in that it\u2019s young with narrow reefs, has small amounts of topsoil and is insulted regularly by natural disasters,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we do have to think about the other human impacts on our environment as well.\u201d",
      "The damage isn\u2019t limited to homes, gardens and reefs \u2014 it\u2019s reaching into places once thought to be untouchable.",
      "On the island of Pele, village chief Amos Kalsont sits at his brother\u2019s grave as waves lap against broken headstones half-buried in sand. At high tide, both his brother's and father\u2019s graves sit just a few arm's lengths from the sea. Some homes and gardens have already been moved inland, and saltwater intrusion has tainted the community\u2019s primary drinking water source. Now, the community is considering relocating the entire village \u2014 but that would mean leaving the land their grandparents cleared by hand.",
      "\u201cThe sea is catching up and we don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d Kalsont said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that we have to face the consequences when we didn\u2019t contribute to this in the first place.\u201d",
      "Many in Vanuatu remain committed to building something stronger and hope the rest of the world will support them.",
      "\u201cThis is our future, and it\u2019s particularly our children\u2019s future, our grandchildren\u2019s future,\u201d said Regenvanu. \u201cWe just have to keep pushing for the best one we can.\u201d",
      "Back in Havannah Harbor, John Warmington still dives the reef he considers part of his family. While much of it is gone, he and his wife Sandy have begun replanting coral fragments in hopes of restoring what\u2019s left.",
      "\u201cOur friend is still here,\u201d he said. \u201cLife is coming back.\u201d",

      "Iran plans to hold nuclear talks with European nations this week in Turkey",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran said Monday it would hold renewed talks this week with European nations over the country's nuclear program, with discussions to be hosted by Turkey.",
      "The talks, to be held in Istanbul on Friday, will be the first since a ceasefire was reached after a 12-day war waged by Israel against Iran in June, which also saw the United States strike nuclear-related facilities in the Islamic Republic. A similar meeting had been held in the Turkish city in May.",
      "The discussions will bring Iranian officials together with officials from Britain, France and Germany \u2014 known as the E3 nations \u2014 and will include the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.",
      "\u201cThe topic of the talks is clear, lifting sanctions and issues related to the peaceful nuclear program of Iran,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said in his weekly briefing. He said the meeting will be held at the deputy ministerial level.",
      "Under a 2015 deal designed to cap Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, Iran agreed to tough restrictions on its international program in exchange for an easing of sanctions. The deal began to unravel in 2018, when the United States pulled out of it and began to reimpose certain sanctions. European countries have recently threatened to trigger the 2015 deal\u2019s \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism, which would allow sanctions to be reimposed in the case of non-compliance by Tehran.",
      "German Foreign Ministry spokesperson Martin Giese, asked who Germany will send to the talks and what its expectations are, said that \u201cthe talks are taking place at expert level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran must never come into possession of a nuclear weapon,\u201d so Germany, France and Britain are \u201ccontinuing to work \u2026 at high pressure on a sustainable and verifiable diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear program,\u201d he said. \u201cThis course of action is also coordinated with the U.S.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that, should no solution be reached by the end of August \u2026 snapback remains an option for the E3,\u201d Giese told reporters in Berlin.",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday the three European nations lack \u201cany legal, political, and moral standing\u201d to invoke such mechanisms, and accused Britain, France and Germany of failing to uphold their commitments in the deal.",
      "\u201cAttempting to trigger \u2018snapback\u2019 under these circumstances, in defiance of established facts and prior communications, constitutes an abuse of process that the international community must reject,\u201d Araghchi said.",
      "He also criticized the three European nations for \u201cproviding political and material support to the recent unprovoked and illegal military aggression of the Israeli regime and the US.\u201d",
      "The U.S. bombed three major Iranian nuclear sites in Iran in June as Israel waged an air war with Iran. Nearly 1,100 people were killed in Iran, including many military commanders and nuclear scientists, while 28 were killed in Israel.",
      "Araghchi stressed in the letter that his country is ready for diplomatic solutions.",
      "After U.S. President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the 2015 deal, Iran has gradually increased its nuclear activities, including enriching uranium up to 60%, a step away from weapons-grade nuclear materials, or 90% enrichment of uranium.",
      "Iran denies allegations it is seeking a nuclear weapon and has long said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.",

      "LONDON -- A town on the outskirts of London was rocked by protesters who descended on a hotel housing asylum seekers for the second time in four days on Sunday night, amid anger about a migrant accused of sexual assault.",
      "Police in the town of Epping said they arrested six people on Sunday, including four suspected of involvement in \u201cviolent disorder\u201d during the previous demonstration on Thursday. Officers patrolled the area around the Bell Hotel throughout the night after issuing an order for the crowds to disperse.",
      "Chanting \u201cSave our kids\u201d and \u201cSend them home,\u201d more than 100 demonstrators, some brandishing British flags, gathered outside the hotel Sunday evening. The protests escalated as night fell, with flares and projectiles thrown toward police vans blocking the entrance. Police escorted a counter-protester from the area after demonstrators surrounded her.",
      "\u201cDisappointingly we have seen yet another protest, which begun peacefully, escalate into mindless thuggery with individuals again hurting one of our officers and damaging a police vehicle,\u2033 Chief Superintendent Simon Anslow of the Essex Police said in a statement. \u201cFor anyone who thinks we will tolerate their thuggery \u2014 think again.\u2019\u2018",
      "The protests come amid escalating tensions over the rising number of asylum seekers who are being housed at government expense in hotels around the country. Those pressures flared into days of rioting last month in Northern Ireland after two teenagers were arrested on charges of sexual assault.",
      "Violent anti-immigrant protests spread throughout the U.K. last summer after social media users spread misinformation about the identity of the person who attacked a dance class in the northwestern town of Southport, killing three young girls. The attacker was a 17-year-old who was born in the U.K. born in the U.K. to parents from Rwanda, not an asylum seeker as had been rumored.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned last year\u2019s riots as \u201cfar-right thuggery\u201d as police intervened to stop the violence and expedited the sentencing of those convicted of taking part.",
      "Before Sunday\u2019s protests in Epping, local police issued an order that allowed them to force demonstrators to remove face coverings. The later issued an order for the demonstrators to leave the area around the hotel. That dispersal order remained in effect until 4 a.m. Monday.",
      "The demonstration came after eight police officers were injured on Thursday after a peaceful protest outside the hotel escalated into violence. Police blamed the violence on people from outside the community who \u201carrived at the scene intent on causing trouble.\u201d",
      "Four of those detained on Sunday were arrested in connection with events that happened during the initial protest, police said. A fifth was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage to a police car, while the sixth was arrested for being equipped to cause criminal damage.",
      "The protests began after a 38-year-old asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault after allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. The man is being held without bail after he had his first court appearance on July 10. He denies the charges.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take sides, we arrest criminals and we have a duty to ensure no-one is hurt \u2014 plain and simple,\u2033 Anslow said. \u201cI know the people of Essex know what we\u2019re about so I know they won\u2019t believe the rubbish circulating online that is designed to do nothing more than inflame tensions and trouble.\u2019\u2019",
      "Epping Forest District Council, which provides local government services in the area, condemned the violence but said it had long opposed the central government\u2019s decision to use the Bell Hotel to house asylum seekers.",
      "\u201cWe have consistently shared concerns with the Home Office that the Bell Hotel is an entirely unsuitable location for this facility and should close,\u201d council Leader Chris Whitbread said in a statement last week. \u201cWe continue to press Home Office officials for the immediate closure of the site and are encouraged that our local MPs are now actively supporting our call.\u201d",

      "The British government has announced a public inquiry into the 1984 \"Battle of Orgreave,\" a violent clash between police and striking miners",
      "LONDON -- The British government said Monday that it will hold a public inquiry into the \u201cBattle of Orgreave,\u201d a violent confrontation between police and striking coal miners that became a defining moment in the conflict between unions and then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government.",
      "Some 120 miners and police were hurt when officers clashed with miners trying to stop trucks entering the Orgreave Coking Plant in northern England on June 18, 1984. It came three months into a nationwide strike over plans to close two dozen coal pits and lay of 20,000 miners.",
      "The bitter dispute between the National Union of Mineworkers and the government was a decisive moment in Thatcher\u2019s bid to break the power of trade unions and remake the U.K. economy along free-market lines. The strike ended in defeat for the miners after a year and hastened the end of British coal mining, which employed 180,000 people at the start of the strike. Today, no coal mines remain.",
      "Campaigners have long called for an inquiry into why police from across the country were sent to Orgreave and what their orders were. Images of mounted police in riot gear charging stone-throwing miners with truncheons and dogs shocked and divided the nation.",
      "Some 95 picketers were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder, but all charges were later dropped after evidence from the police was discredited.",
      "The Home Office said the inquiry will be led by Pete Wilcox, the bishop of Sheffield, and start in the fall. It will have the power to compel witnesses to testify under oath.",
      "Kate Flannery, secretary of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said the announcement of an inquiry was \u201creally positive news.\u201d She said it must be given \u201cunrestricted access to all relevant information including government, police and media documents, photos and films.\u201d",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the events at Orgreave \u201ccast a shadow over communities in Yorkshire and other mining areas.",
      "\u201cThe violent scenes and subsequent prosecutions raised concerns that have been left unanswered for decades, and we must now establish what happened,\u201d she said.",

      "Opposition leaders and Mwangi's followers had feared he would be charged with the more serious offense of terrorism.",
      "He was freed on bond immediately after his appearance in court on Monday.",

Detectives searched his home and his office.",
      "The Kenya Human Rights Commission described the ammunition charge as a \u201ctrumped-up accusation.\u201d",

      "Tom Barrack took a critical tone toward Israel\u2019s recent intervention in Syria, calling it poorly timed and saying that it complicated efforts to stabilize the region.",
      "Barrack, who is ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria and also has a short-term mandate in Lebanon, made the comments in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press during a visit to Beirut. He spoke following more than a week of clashes in the southern province of Sweida between militias of the Druze religious minority and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes.",
      "Syrian government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up siding with the Bedouins before withdrawing under a ceasefire agreement with Druze factions. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting, and some government fighters allegedly shot dead Druze civilians and burned and looted their houses.",
      "In the meantime, Israel intervened last week on behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. Israel launched dozens of strikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and also struck the Syrian Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus.",
      "Over the weekend, Barrack announced a ceasefire between Syria and Israel, without giving details. Syrian government forces have redeployed in Sweida to halt renewed clashes between the Druze and Bedouins, and civilians from both sides were set to be evacuated Monday.",
      "Barrack told the AP that \u201cthe killing, the revenge, the massacres on both sides\u201d are \u201cintolerable,\u201d but that \u201cthe current government of Syria, in my opinion, has conducted themselves as best they can as a nascent government with very few resources to address the multiplicity of issues that arise in trying to bring a diverse society together.\u201d At a later press conference he said the Syrian authorities \u201cneed to be held accountable\u201d for violations.",
      "Regarding Israel's strikes on Syria, Barrack said: \u201cThe United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defense.\"",
      "However, he said that Israel's intervention \"creates another very confusing chapter\" and \u201ccame at a very bad time.\"",
      "Prior to the conflict in Sweida, Israel and Syria had been engaging in talks over security matters, while the Trump administration had been pushing them to move toward a full normalization of diplomatic relations.",
      "When the latest fighting erupted, \u201cIsrael\u2019s view was that south of Damascus was this questionable zone, so that whatever happened militarily in that zone needed to be agreed upon and discussed with them,\u201d Barrack said. \u201cThe new government (in Syria) coming in was not exactly of that belief.\u201d",
      "The ceasefire announced Saturday between Syria and Israel is a limited agreement addressing only the conflict in Sweida, he said. It does not address the broader issues between the two countries, including Israel's contention that the area south of Damascus should be a demilitarized zone.",
      "In the discussions leading up to the ceasefire, Barrack said \u201cboth sides did the best they can\u201d to came to an agreement on specific questions related to the movement of Syrian forces and equipment from Damascus to Sweida.",
      "\u201cWhether you accept that Israel can intervene in a sovereign state is a different question,\u201d he said.",
      "He suggested that Israel would prefer to see Syria fragmented and divided rather than a strong central state in control of the country.",
      "\"Strong nation states are a threat \u2014 especially Arab states are viewed as a threat to Israel,\" he said. But in Syria, he said, \u201cI think all of the the minority communities are smart enough to say, we\u2019re better off together, centralized.\u201d",
      "The violence in Sweida has deepened the distrust of minority religious and ethnic groups in Syria toward the new government in Damascus, led by Sunni Muslim former insurgents who unseated Syria's longtime autocratic ruler, Bashar Assad, in a lightning offensive in December.",
      "The attacks on Druze civilians followed the deaths of hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, to which Assad belongs, earlier this year in sectarian revenge attacks on the Syrian coast. While interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to protect minorities and punish those who target civilians, many feel his government has not done enough.",
      "At the same time, Damascus has been negotiating with the Kurdish forces that control much of northeast Syria to implement an agreement that would merge the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with the new national army.",
      "Barrack, who spoke to SDF leader Mazloum Abdi over the weekend, said he does not believe the violence in Sweida will derail those talks and that there could be a breakthrough \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "Neighboring Turkey, which wants to curtail the influence of Kurdish groups along its border and has tense relations with Israel, has offered to provide defense assistance to Syria.",
      "Barrack said the U.S. has \u201cno position\u201d on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in the U.S.\u2019s business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Barrack's visit to Lebanon came amid ongoing domestic and international pressure for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to give up its remaining arsenal after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement in November.",
      "Speaking at a press conference in Beirut Monday, Barrack said the ceasefire agreement \u201cdidn\u2019t work.\u201d",

      "The pontiff was accompanied by astronomers and students participating in the traditional summer school organized by the observatory.",
      "This was Pope Leo\u2019s first visit to the observatory, founded in 1891 by Leo XIII. The first vision of it, however, can be traced back to the establishment by Pope Gregory XIII of a commission aimed at studying the scientific data and implications of the calendar reform that took place in 1582.",
      "The Vatican Observatory has generated top-notch research from its scientist-clerics, drawing academics to its meteorite collection, which includes bits of Mars and is considered among the world\u2019s best.",
      "Later Sunday, the pope called astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who shared with Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins the historic 1969 moonwalk.",
      "\u201cThis evening, 56 years after the Apollo 11 moon landing, I spoke with the astronaut Buzz Aldrin,\u201d Pope Leo wrote on his X account. \u201cTogether we shared the memory of a historic feat, a testimony to human ingenuity, and we reflected on the mystery and greatness of Creation.\u201d",
      "Pope Leo then blessed the astronaut, his family and his collaborators.",
      "There are a few precedents of papal calls to \"space.\u201d",
      "In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI rang the space station and asked about the future of the planet and the environmental risks it faced.",
      "Before Benedict, Pope Paul VI sent a radio message to astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins after their moonwalk, calling them \u201cconquerors of the Moon.\u201d",

      "The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours have filed a federal lawsuit",
      "DENVER -- The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours filed a federal lawsuit Monday, accusing the jail's nurses and sheriff's deputes of ignoring his cries for help.",
      "The lawsuit blames them, local government officials and Southern Health Partners for failing to stop the death of Daniel Foard in 2023 by taking him to the hospital. Foard, 32, was a cook at a brewpub and user of fentanyl who was arrested for failing to appear in court. After being segregated and monitored for withdrawal from the synthetic opioid, he began vomiting and complained of stomach pain after being put in a regular jail cell, it said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Southern Health Partners \u2014 the Tennessee-based company they contracted with to provide health care at the La Plata County jail \u2014 has tried to maximize its profits at the jail by only having one nurse on duty at a time, leaving it to medically untrained deputies to monitor sick inmates. The company holds hundred of contracts at jails around the country and the lawsuit alleges that is has been involved in lawsuits related to the deaths of at least five other jail inmates nationally.",
      "The company's lawyer, Shira Crittendon, said she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment on it.",
      "The sheriff's office referred questions about the the lawsuit to a county spokesperson. In a statement, the county said it had not analyzed the allegations in the lawsuit and does not comment publicly on active litigation.",
      "Foard was found dead in the jail on Aug. 17, 2023, six days after he was arrested.",
      "An autopsy found Foard died as a result of a hole created by an ulcer in his small intestine, which caused inflammation of the tissue lining his abdomen. Such ulcers can let food and digestive juices leak out of the body's digestive tract.",
      "Fentanyl was found in Foard's blood but the autopsy report did not name that as a cause of his death. Dr. Michael Arnall ruled Foard's death was due to natural causes.",
      "On Aug. 15, 2023, even though Foard had collapsed several times and had trouble standing, he was moved out of an area where he could be more easily observed for problems with his withdrawal and put into a regular jail cell, staggering as we went, the lawsuit said. The day nurse ignored a deputy's concern that he was very unstable, according to the lawsuit brought by lawyers Dan Weiss, Anna Holland Edwards, John Holland and Erica Grossman.",
      "After a deputy delivering breakfast on Aug. 16, 2023 saw that Foard repeatedly fell while trying to get his tray, the jail's day nurse came to check on him, it said. She recorded that Foard reported he had sharp, shooting pain that was a \u201c10\u201d on a scale of one to 10, but she did not call for a doctor or send him to the hospital, it said.",
      "The nurse moved Foard to an empty cell where he could be monitored but didn't tell deputies what he was being monitored for and didn't order any follow up care or check on him, it said. He vomited all day and was moved to another cell and then a third because they had all become so messy with vomit, it said. Surveillance video showed him crawling to the final cell, where it said he continuously called out for help and yelled that he needed to go to a hospital, saying he was vomiting blood. The lawsuit claims that no one responded to his pleas but one deputy could be heard on surveillance video telling him to \u201ctry to hit that drain\u201d with his vomit to keep the cell from becoming dirty.",
      "Another nurse, working the evening shift, only walked by his cell and glanced inside, but did not assess him or provide care as he was pleading for help, the lawsuit said. When she did enter his cell around 10 p.m., Foard was dead, it said. She told state investigators that vomiting was normal for people withdrawing from fentanyl.",
      "The day shift nurse later told a state investigator that it was not unusual that Foard would not have had his vital signs checked for 12 hours because of the number of inmates the jail's nurses need to provide care, according to a report from an investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigations. She also said she didn't think there was anything different she could have done based on Foard's symptoms.",
      "The bureau's findings were forwarded to the 6th District Attorney's Office, which would decide whether any criminal charges were warranted in connection with Foard's death. It's not known whether the office decided to pursue any charges. A telephone message and email sent to District Attorney Sean Murray were not immediately returned.",
      "In a statement, Jim Foard and Susan Gizinski said they want everyone to know about their son's ordeal both to hold those they say are responsible for his death accountable and to change how inmates are treated at the jail.",
      "\u201cJust basic training in having compassion for others would be a great start. But adding more staff is critical too,\u201d they said.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",
      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "With rising trade barriers such as President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, and relatively weak domestic demand, manufacturers have been slashing prices, undermining their bottom lines and driving some out of business.",
      "The producer price index, which measures the price that factories receive for their goods, has fallen steadily for nearly three years in China in a prolonged bout of deflation. The long-running issue spilled over into global markets as low-priced Chinese exports worsen trade friction with key trading partners including the United States and Europe.",
      "In a series of recent statements, the Chinese government and industry associations have signaled they're getting serious about reining in cut-throat competition, known as invollution or \u201cneijuan\u201d in Chinese.",
      "The top 10 makers of glass for solar panels agreed on June 30 to shut kilns and cut production by 30%, an industry association said. The government has launched an auto safety inspection campaign, addressing concerns that automakers were skimping on quality to cut costs.",
      "It's unclear whether these efforts will succeed, but the sense that China may finally be tackling this chronic problem was enough to spark a rally in stocks in some of those under-pressure sectors.",
      "Shares of Liuzhou Iron & Steel Co. gained 10% on Friday and have risen more than 70% since June 30. Solar panel glass producer Changzhou Almaden Co. fell at the end of last week but is still up about 50%.",
      "More broadly, two exchange traded funds in solar panels and steel have risen about 10%, outpacing a 3.2% rise in the Shanghai Composite, China's leading market index.",
      "The performance of EV-maker stocks has been mixed, with Li Auto and Nio recording double-digit percentage gains while market leader BYD declined.",
      "Foreigners can't buy Chinese stocks directly but they are able to invest in about 2,700 stocks and 250 exchange traded funds through the Hong Kong exchange.",
      "The gains follow high-level government pronouncements against disorderly price wars. On June 29, the People's Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, ran a lengthy page 1 article on involution, saying they run counter to the party's goal of high quality economic development.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping weighed in at a closed-door economic meeting, calling for better regulating competition and incentives by local governments to attract factory investments that are blamed for overinvestment in affected industries.",
      "The tougher talk began with a focus on automakers in late May, specifically around electric vehicle price wars that began more than three years ago.",
      "Analysts at investment bank UBS said the shift is good news for auto industry profits and company stocks.",
      "\u201cThough it\u2019s difficult to imagine a sudden U-turn of the industry from fierce competition to orderly consolidation, it\u2019s indeed possible to have near-term ceasefire of the price war,\u201d they wrote.",
      "After BYD launched another round of price cuts on May 23, some competitors, the main industry association and government all called for fair and sustainable competition.",
      "The EV battery industry, the cement association and major construction companies have issued statements echoing calls for an end to excess competition.",
      "The term involution, which suggests a spiraling inward and shrinking, was initially applied in China to students and young workers, who felt they were caught up in meaningless competition that led nowhere as the job market weakened and wages stagnated in recent years.",
      "At the industry level, it has come to mean sectors that have too many companies competing for a slice of the pie, leading to fierce price cutting to try to gain market share.",
      "The mismatch between production capacity \u2014 how much an industry can make \u2014 and actual demand for the product, reflects overcapacity that forces companies to compete for survival in a limited market space, said a recent article in the Communist Party magazine Qiushi.",
      "Some Chinese industries, especially steel and cement, have long suffered from overcapacity. A government push to promote green industries has fostered similar problems in that sector, including solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles.",
      "A flood of Chinese exports is leading to more trade barriers in Europe and the U.S. and in some emerging markets such as Mexico, Indonesia and India.",
      "Ultimately, economists say industries need to consolidate through company mergers and bankruptcies. But the process will take time. A major obstacle is provincial governments that want to protect local companies and jobs.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific at the Natixis investment bank, said that recent comments by top Chinese economic officials suggest they realize something needs to be done.",
      "\u201cHow much is action versus words, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s a big problem for China.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "It has been five years since a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio with the stunning arrests ofa powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates in July 2020",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Five years after a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio, expert observers say the resulting prosecutions, lawsuits, penalties and legislation haven't led to enough change and accountability to prevent politicians and corporate executives from cutting similar deals in the future.",
      "The scheme \u2014 whose prospective $2 billion-plus pricetag to consumers makes it the largest infrastructure scandal in U.S. history \u2014 surfaced with the stunning arrests of a powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates on July 21, 2020.",
      "That lawmaker, former House Speaker Larry Householder, is serving 20 years in federal prison for masterminding the racketeering operation at the center of the scandal.",
      "Jurors agreed with prosecutors that money that changed hands wasn\u2019t everyday political giving, but an elaborate secret scheme orchestrated by Householder to elect political allies, become the House speaker, pass a $1 billion nuclear bailout law in House Bill 6 and crush a repeal effort. One of the dark money groups Householder used also pleaded guilty to racketeering.",
      "Householder and a former lobbyist have unsuccessfully challenged their convictions. Two of the arrested associates pleaded guilty, and the other died by suicide.",
      "Any hope that the convictions would have clarified federal law around 501(c)4 nonprofit \u201cdark money\u201d groups or prompted new restrictions on those hasn\u2019t materialized, said former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers, who led the initial investigation.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s actually worse than it was before,\u201d he said. \u201cNationally, you have both Democrats and Republicans using these, so there\u2019s no political will to do anything about it.\u201d",
      "Indeed, a study released in May by the Brennan Center for Justice found that dark money unleashed by the 2010 Citizens United decision hit a record high of $1.9 billion in 2024 federal races, nearly double the $1 billion spent in 2020. The vast majority of money from undisclosed donors raised into dark money accounts now goes to super PACs, providing them a way to skirt a requirement that they make their donors public, the study found.",
      "DeVillers said one positive result of the scandal is that Ohio lawmakers appear genuinely concerned about avoiding quid pro quos, real or perceived, between them and their political contributors.",
      "Anti-corruption legislation perennially introduced by Ohio Democrats since the scandal broke has gone nowhere in the GOP-dominated Legislature. Republican legislative leaders have said it is outside their authority to amend federal campaign finance law.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to discuss the investigation because prosecutions remain ongoing. Two fired FirstEnergy executives have pleaded not guilty on related state and federal charges and await trial.",
      "Former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chairman Samuel Randazzo, to whom FirstEnergy admitted giving a $4.3 million bribe in exchange for regulatory favors, had faced both federal and state charges. He died by suicide after pleading not guilty.",
      "Akron-based FirstEnergy \u2014 a $23 billion Fortune 500 company with 6 million customers in five states \u2014 admitted using dark money groups to bankroll Householder\u2019s ascendance in exchange for passage of the bailout bill. It agreed to pay $230 million and meet other conditions to avoid prosecution, and faced other sanctions, including a $100 million civil penalty by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "But FirstEnergy hasn't yet faced consequences from the state regulator.",
      "\u201cThey never actually got penalized by regulators at the PUCO level,\u201d said Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel Maureen Willis, the lawyer for Ohio utility customers.",
      "Testimony in four PUCO proceedings stemming from the scandal finally began last month after the cases were delayed for nearly two years, in part at the request of the Justice Department. They\u2019re intended to determine whether FirstEnergy used money for bribes that was meant for grid modernization and whether it improperly comingled money from its different corporate entities.",
      "FirstEnergy spokeperson Jennifer Young said it invested $4 billion in grid upgrades in 2024 and plans to spend a total of $28 billion through 2029.",
      "Young said FirstEnergy has redesigned its organizational structure, established a dedicated ethics and compliance office, overhauled the company\u2019s political activity and lobbying practices and strengthened other corporate governance and oversight practices.",
      "\u201cFirstEnergy is a far different company today than it was five years ago,\u201d she said.",
      "The PUCO also made changes in response to the scandal. Chair Jenifer French told state lawmakers that ethics training has been enhanced, staff lawyers and the administrative law judges who hear cases now report to different directors to ensure legal independence, and she never takes a meeting alone.",
      "Ashley Brown, a retired executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group who previously served as a PUCO commissioner, said the commission is the only state entity with the power to order FirstEnergy to return tainted cash \u2014 including the bribe money \u2014 to customers. That largely hasn\u2019t happened.",
      "He said the Ohio commission had vast power to hold FirstEnergy accountable for its misdeeds but hasn't conducted its own management audit of the energy giant, demanded an overhaul of FirstEnergy\u2019s corporate board or pressed for public release of FirstEnergy\u2019s own internal investigation of the scandal, whose findings remain a mystery. Shareholders won some accountability measures as part of a $180 million settlement in 2022, but they continue to fight in court for release of the investigation. Willis does, too.",
      "\u201cHow do you allow a utility to operate a vast criminal conspiracy within the utility (with) consumer dollars, and you don\u2019t even look at what went wrong?\u201d Brown said.",
      "PUCO spokesperson Matt Schilling reiterated that the commission's probes are ongoing. He said the panel has vowed to take its proceedings \u201cwherever the facts lead.\u201d",
      "The portion of HB 6 that bailed out two FirstEnergy-affiliated nuclear plants was repealed in 2021, and $26 million was refunded to customers.",
      "The scandal investigation revealed that other power distribution companies got a lucrative payout of their own added to the bill in exchange for their buy-in: subsidies for two unprofitable Cold War-era coal plants. It wasn\u2019t until April that a law was passed repealing those subsidies.",
      "Until that takes effect Aug. 14, the charges cost Ohio ratepayers $445,679 a day \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if or when they\u2019ll get that money back. A ticker on Willis\u2019 website puts the total they\u2019ve paid at more than $500 million and counting.",

      "The recall covers a range of Bestway, Intex Recreation and Polygroup pools that were sold by major retailers as far back as 2002. According to Monday notices published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada, these pools have compression straps running along the outside of the product \u2014 which \u201cmay create a foothold\u201d for small children and allow them to access the water unattended.",
      "That can pose a serious drowning risk, the safety regulatory warn. To date, the CPSC believes nine children across the U.S. have drowned after gaining access to these now-recalled pools in this way. Those deaths occurred between 2007 and 2022, involving children between the ages of 22 months and 3 years old. No additional fatalities have been reported in Canada.",
      "Consumers in possession of these pools are urged to immediately contact Bestway, Intex and/or Polygroup to receive a free repair kit \u2014 which will consist of a rope to replace the compression strap.

    "story": [
      "Newer airport screening machines that operate like medical CT scanners are better at spotting liquid explosives, but many airports still lack that expensive equipment",
      "Travelers celebrated the suggestion that American airports might soon ease restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags that create endless hassles at security checkpoints, but more than a third of all airports around the country still haven't upgraded their screening systems to reliably detect liquid explosives that could bring down a plane.",
      "It may be annoying to have to dump water and other drinks before going through security, but the challenge is to detect the difference between things like harmless hair gel and more sinister substances. The threat nearly materialized in an attack in 2006, when authorities in the United Kingdom arrested a group that was plotting to blow holes in airliners with a homemade mixture of chemicals in sports drink bottles.",
      "Security experts remain concerned about the vulnerabilities that were exposed by that plot.",
      "Comments this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem got travelers excited about the prospect of one day being able to fly with more than 3 ounces of their shampoos and gels and not having to throw out the beverage they just bought.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it\u2019s still as safe.\u201d",
      "A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said Noem and the agency \u201care constantly looking for ways to enhance security, and improve the travel experience for the public.\u201d",
      "Any changes will come through the same official channels that TSA used to announce this month that travelers can keep their shoes on at checkpoints. That change offers relief from a rule adopted after \u201cshoe bomber\u201d Richard Reid\u2019s failed attempt to take down a flight from Paris to Miami in late 2001 with a small explosive device hidden in his footwear.",
      "The limits on liquids were triggered by the 2006 U.K. arrests. Three ringleaders were eventually convicted.",
      "Prosecutors told the jury in that case that authorities uncovered the plot after secretly searching the luggage of a man who was on their radar for security concerns after he returned from Pakistan and found the unusual combination of the Tang powdered soft drink and a large number of batteries, according to the BBC. That triggered the surveillance operation that eventually grew to include more than 200 officers.",
      "Agents discovered what appeared to be a bomb factory in a London apartment where odd devices were being constructed out of drink bottles. The plot didn't make sense until authorities discovered that the men were researching flight timetables and realized they were only trying to make an explosive big enough to rip a hole in a plane.",
      "The meaning of coded emails to contacts in Pakistan only became clear after the arrests, when authorities realized that the quantities of Calvin Klein aftershave being discussed in messages matched the amount of hydrogen peroxide the conspirators had purchased.",
      "Ever since then, the TSA and authorities in other countries have limited carry-on liquids and gels to 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) because officials believe that amount is too small to create an explosion capable of taking down a plane. The restriction covered all types of liquids, because X-ray machines at checkpoints couldn't differentiate between explosive and harmless ones.",
      "The United Kingdom was planning to ease its restrictions last year to allow people to carry up to 2 liters (about half a gallon) of liquid, but that was delayed because several major airports still didn't have the new scanners that use computed tomography, commonly known as a CT scan, to produce clearer images.",
      "The new machines allow screeners to switch between two-dimensional and three-dimensional images and turn them to see what may be lurking, said Johnny Jones, secretary treasurer of the chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees that represents TSA workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a totally life-changing situation,\u201d said Jones, who has worked as a screener since the agency was created. \u201cIt\u2019s a difference of being able to see something that would have been hidden by something that you can now see clear as day with the new technology. It eliminates the guesswork.\u201d",
      "The problem is that only 255 of the 432 airports across the United States have new CT scanners installed, the interim head of the TSA told Congress this spring. The biggest airports got them first, but they are not expected to be everywhere until 2043.",
      "It's possible that a change in carry-on liquid policy could be implemented just at the biggest airports, but that could lead to confusion if travelers, are, say, allowed to bring full bottles on departure only to have them confiscated when they return.",
      "The scanners cost more than $2 million apiece, and they are so much bigger than the old X-ray machines that sometimes floors must be reinforced and checkpoints have to be redesigned.",
      "\u201cI think you need to hold off till we get more systems deployed. I think this one\u2019s a little too early,\u201d said Jeff Price, who teaches aviation security at Metropolitan State University of Denver and has co-authored books on the subject. \u201cThe keep your shoes on \u2014 I can get on board with that provided we continue to do random screenings. But the liquids, I think we\u2019re too early on that. There\u2019s other layers of security. Yeah, I know that. But not too many of them that prevent this type of attack.\u201d",
      "In the past the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted vulnerabilities in TSA screening that can allow things to slip through undetected.",
      "A 2015 report found that TSA officers failed 95% of the time to detect weapons or explosive material carried by undercover inspectors.",
      "But Jones defended the work of the screeners he represents, noting that since the agency's creation, no plane has failed to reach its destination because of something that was missed.",
      "\u201cNothing large has been able to make it through our system since we\u2019ve taken over screening. We've protected the skies for 22 years,\u201d Jones said. \u201cEven if you have a slight miss, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything is going to happen on the plane.\u201d",

      "Midway through summer, U.S. retailers are sweating a different season",
      "NEW YORK -- With summer in full swing in the United States, retail executives are sweating a different season. It\u2019s less than 22 weeks before Christmas, a time when businesses that make and sell consumer goods usually nail down their holiday orders and prices.",
      "But President Donald Trump's vacillating trade policies have complicated those end-of-year plans. Balsam Hill, which sells artificial trees and other decorations online, expects to publish fewer and thinner holiday catalogs because the featured products keep changing with the tariff rates the president sets, postpones and revises.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty has led us to spend all our time trying to rejigger what we\u2019re ordering, where we\u2019re bringing it in, when it\u2019s going to get here,\u201d Mac Harman, CEO of Balsam Hill parent company Balsam Brands, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which items we\u2019re going to have to put in the catalog or not.\"",
      "Months of confusion over which foreign countries' goods may become more expensive to import has left a question mark over the holiday shopping season. U.S. retailers often begin planning for the winter holidays in January and typically finalize the bulk of their orders by the end of June. The seesawing tariffs already have factored into their calculations.",
      "The consequences for consumers? Stores may not have the specific gift items customers want come November and December. Some retail suppliers and buyers scaled back their holiday lines rather than risking a hefty tax bill or expensive imports going unsold. Businesses still are setting prices but say shoppers can expect many things to cost more, though by how much depends partly on whether Trump's latest round of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs kicks in next month.",
      "The lack of clarity has been especially disruptive for the U.S. toy industry, which sources nearly 80% of its products from China. American toy makers usually ramp up production in April, a process delayed until late May this year after the president put a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, according to Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, an industry trade group.",
      "The U.S. tariff rate may have dropped significantly from its spring high \u2014 a truce in the U.S.-China trade war is set to expire on Aug. 12 \u2014 but continues to shape the forthcoming holiday period. Manufacturing activity is way down from a year ago for small- and medium-sized U.S. toy companies, Ahearn said.",
      "The late start to factory work in China means holiday toys are only now arriving at U.S. warehouses, industry experts said. A big unknown is whether tariffs will keep stores from replenishing supplies of any breakout hit toys that emerge in September, said James Zahn, editor-in-chief of the trade publication Toy Book.",
      "In the retail world, planning for Christmas in July usually involves mapping out seasonal marketing and promotion strategies. Dean Smith, who co-owns independent toy stores JaZams in Princeton, New Jersey, and Lahaska, Pennsylvania, said he recently spent an hour and a half running through pricing scenarios with a Canadian distributor because the wholesale cost of some products increased by 20%.",
      "Increasing his own prices that much might turn off customers, Smith said, so he explored ways to \"maintain a reasonable margin without raising prices beyond what consumers would accept.\u201d He ordered a lower cost Crazy Forts building set so he would have the toy on hand and left out the kids' edition of the Anomia card game because he didn't think customers would pay what he would have to charge.",
      "\u201cIn the end, I had to eliminate half of the products that I normally buy,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Hilary Key, owner of The Toy Chest in Nashville, Indiana, said she tries to get new games and toys in early most years to see which ones she should stock up on for the winter holidays. This year, she abandoned her product testing for fear any delayed orders would incur high import taxes.",
      "Meanwhile, vendors of toys made in China and elsewhere bombarded Key with price increase notices. For example, Schylling, which makes Needoh, Care Bear collectibles and modern versions of nostalgic toys like My Little Pony, increased prices on orders by 20%, according to Key.",
      "All the price hikes are subject to change if the tariff situation changes again. Key worries her store won\u2019t have as compelling a product assortment as she prides herself on carrying.",
      "\u201cMy concern is not that I\u2019ll have nothing, because I can bring in more books. I can bring in more gifts, or I can bring in just things that are manufactured in other places,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to have the best stock for every developmental age, for every special need.\"",
      "The retail industry may have to keep taking a whack-a-mole approach to navigating the White House's latest tariff ultimatums and temporary reprieves. Last week, the president again reset the rates on imports from Brazil, the European Union, Mexico, and other major trading partners but said they would not take effect until Aug. 1.",
      "The brief pause should extend the window importers have to bring in seasonal merchandise at the current baseline tariff of 10%. The Port of Los Angeles had the busiest June in its 117-year history after companies raced to secure holiday shipments, and July imports look strong so far, according to Gene Seroka, the port's executive director.",
      "\u201cIn my view, we're seeing a peak season push right now to bring in goods ahead of potentially higher tariffs later this summer,\" Seroka said Monday.",
      "The pace of port activity so far this year reflects a \u201ctariff whipsaw effect\u201d \u2014 imports slowing when tariffs kick in and rebounding when they're paused, he said. \u201cFor us consumers, lower inventory levels, fewer selections and higher prices are likely as we head into the holidays.\u201d",
      "Smith, who co-owns the two JaZams stores with his partner, Joanne Farrugia, said they started placing holiday orders two months earlier than usual for \u201ccertain items that we felt were essential for us to have at particular pricing.\u201d They doubled their warehouse space to store the stockpile. But some shoppers are trying to get ahead of higher prices just like businesses are, he said.",
      "He's noticed customers snapping up items that will likely be popular during the holidays, like Jellycat plush toys and large stuffed unicorns and dogs. Any sales are welcome, but Smith and Farrugia are wary of having to restock at a higher cost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be as friendly as we can to the consumer and still have a product portfolio or profile that is gonna meet the needs of all of our various customers, which is getting more and more challenging by the day,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Balsam Brands' Harman said he's had to resign himself to not having as robust a selection of ornaments and frosted trees to sell as in years' past. Soon, it will be too late to import meaningful additions to his range of products.",
      "\u201cOur purpose as a company is to create joy together, and we\u2019re going to do our very best to do that this year,\" Harman said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to have a bunch of the items that consumers want this year, and that\u2019s not a position we want to be in.\"",

      "The KM Barcelona 5 was headed to Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province, from Talaud, an island district in the province when it caught fire in waters near Talise, said Vice Adm. Denih Hendrata, commander of the Indonesian Fleet Command.",
      "He said that three navy ships had been deployed, and 284 passengers and crew members had been evacuated so far. The rescue operation included assistance from local fishermen, who saved some survivors wearing life jackets as they were drifting to nearby islands in the choppy waters.",
      "Rescuers retrieved five bodies, including a pregnant woman.",
      "There were no immediate reports of injuries, and no exact figures of passengers and crew members onboard the ferry.",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \u2019s ruling coalition failed Monday to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, further shaking the stability of his government as Japan faces challenges such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs.",
      "Ishiba\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito, which needed to win 50 seats on top of the 75 seats they already have to retain their majority, won 47 seats. It was three seats short of a majority and a retreat of 19 seats from before the vote.",
      "The loss is another blow to Ishiba\u2019s coalition, making it a minority in both houses following its October defeat in the lower house election, and worsening Japan\u2019s political instability. It was the first time the LDP-led coalition has lost a majority in both houses of parliament since the party\u2019s formation in 1955.",
      "Despite the loss, Ishiba expressed determination to stay on and not create a political vacuum to tackle challenges such as U.S. tariff threats, but he could face calls from within his party to step down or find another coalition partner.",
      "\u201cI will fulfill my responsibility as head of the No. 1 party and work for the country,\u201d he said.",
      "Ishiba had set the bar low, wanting a simple majority of 125 seats, which means his LDP and its Buddhist-backed junior coalition partner Komeito needed to win 50 seats. Exit poll results released seconds after the ballots closed Sunday night mostly showed a major setback for Ishiba\u2019s coalition.",
      "The LDP alone won 39 seats, better than most exit poll projections of 32, and still the No. 1 party in the parliament, known as the Diet. But Ishiba said the coalition's poor showing was because his government\u2019s measures to combat price increases had yet to reach many people.",
      "\u201cIt's a tough situation. I take it humbly and sincerely,\u201d Ishiba told a live interview with NHK.",
      "The poor performance in the election will not immediately trigger a change of government because the upper house lacks the power to file a no-confidence motion against a leader, but it will certainly deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan\u2019s political stability. Ishiba could face calls from within the LDP party to step down or find another coalition partner.",
      "Soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top issues for frustrated, cash-strapped voters. Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors also emerged as a key issue, with a surging right-wing populist party leading the campaign.",
      "Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba.",
      "Ishiba resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect of a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.",
      "Frustrated voters were rapidly turning to emerging populist parties. The eight main opposition groups, however, were too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "The emerging populist party Sanseito stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance, with its \u201cJapanese First\u201d platform that proposes a new agency to handle policies related to foreigners. The party\u2019s populist platform also includes anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.",
      "Conservative opposition groups, especially the DPP and Sanseito, gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats\u2019 expense, while the centrist top opposition CDPJ was sluggish. The DPP quadrupled to 17 seats from four, according to interim results reported by Japanese media. Sanseito surged to 14 from just one.",
      "Sanseito leader, former local assembly member and a Self-Defense Force reserve personnel, told NHK said he is open to cooperate with the ruling bloc on conservative policies while waiting to gain more seats in the other house in a next election and form a multi-party coalition as in Europe.",
      "None of the opposition parties said that they were open to cooperating with the governing coalition. CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda told NHK that his priority is to form an alliance among the opposition. \u201cPublic opinion clearly said \u2018no\u2019 to the Ishiba government,\u201d Noda said.",
      "The spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.",
      "The LDP has almost continuously dominated Japan's postwar politics, contributing to its political stability and social conformity. But voters are divided between stability and change, with some voicing concern about escalating xenophobia.",
      "Yuko Tsuji, a 43-year-old consultant who came to a polling station inside a downtown Tokyo gymnasium with her husband, said they both support LDP for stability and unity. They voted \u201cfor candidates who won't fuel division.\"",
      "\u201cIf the ruling party doesn\u2019t govern properly, the conservative base will drift toward extremes. So I voted with the hope that the ruling party would tighten things up,\u201d she said.",
      "Self-employed Daiichi Nasu, 57, who came to vote with his dog, said he hopes for a change toward a more inclusive and diverse society, with more open immigration and gender policies such as allowing married couples to keep separate surnames.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I voted for the CDPJ,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see progress on those fronts.\u201d",

      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election",
      "WASHINGTON -- If one theme has emerged in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, it's this: He's leveraged the power of his office for personal gain unlike anyone before in history.",
      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election, an unprecedented flood of often shadowy money from billionaires, foreign governments and cryptocurrency tycoons with interests before the federal government.",
      "\u201cHe is president and is supposed to be working in the public\u2019s interest,\u201d said James Thurber, an emeritus professor at American University, who has researched lobbying, campaign finance and political corruption for decades. \u201cInstead, he is helping his own personal interest to grow his wealth. It\u2019s totally not normal.\u201d",
      "The sums amassed by the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the president\u2019s children, are far greater than those collected by the family during the president\u2019s first term, when patronage of his hotels, resorts and golf courses was de rigueur to curry favor with the famously transactional commander-in-chief.",
      "The second time around, the Trump family\u2019s ambitions are far grander, stretching from cyberspace to far-flung regions across the globe. One of Trump\u2019s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320 million since January, while another received a $2 billion investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550 million in tokens.",
      "His sons have jetted across the Middle East to line up new development deals, while his daughter and son-in-law are working with the Albanian government to build a Mediterranean island resort. Even first lady Melania Trump has inked a $40 million documentary deal with Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, was a frequent target of Trump during his first presidency and whose companies contract extensively with the federal government.",
      "The dealmaking is a rejection of Trump\u2019s first-term pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington and dwarfs the influence peddling efforts of former President Joe Biden\u2019s family, whom Trump and his allies attacked as the \u201cBiden Crime Family.\u201d",
      "While Democrats have condemned Trump for his overlapping roles as a beneficiary and president, he is not likely to face any immediate repercussions for such extensive conflicts-of-interest. Congress is controlled by fellow Republicans, and his administration is stocked with loyalists who have dismantled many guardrails of oversight. Last summer, the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority cemented by Trump, ruled that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Even in the rare cases where Trump\u2019s allies have urged caution, the president has ignored them. That\u2019s what happened when he accepted a $400 million \u201cbeautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane\u201d from the Qatari government. Trump said the Boeing 747 \u201cwould go directly\u201d to his presidential library upon leaving office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mount Everest of corruption\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Since Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace, presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan kept assets in a \u201cblind trust,\u201d while George H.W. Bush used a \u201cdiversified trust,\u201d which blocked him from knowing what was in his portfolio. His son, George W. Bush, used a similar arrangement.",
      "Barack Obama was an exception, but his investments were mostly a bland mix of index funds and U.S. treasuries. During his first term, Trump even gave a nod toward ethics. He issued a moratorium on foreign deals. But instead of placing his assets in a blind trust like many of his predecessors, he handed the reins of the Trump Organization to his children, which kept his financial holdings close.",
      "This time, he has made no such gesture. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., are again running the business while Trump is in office. And though the White House says he is not involved in its day-to-day decisions, the trust he has established continues to profit. He promotes his resorts, merchandise and the family\u2019s crypto ventures while residing in the White House, often from his account on Truth Social, the social media company he and his allies launched.",
      "He\u2019s also touted a line of Trump shoes, a Bible, which is made in China, and Trump guitars, one of which is a $1,500 Gibson Les Paul knockoff, featuring \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d fret inlays. Conservative groups and Republican committees have spent at least $25 million at Trump properties since 2015, with most of it coming from Trump\u2019s own political organization, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "Yet, those ventures pale in comparison to his exploits in cryptocurrency, which offers perhaps the clearest example of the conflicts of interest that have come to dominate Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump was once a crypto skeptic who declared that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money,\u201d were based on \u201cthin air\u201d and seemed \u201clike a scam.\u201d By the time he was running again for president, however, he\u2019d become a proponent of the industry.",
      "\u201cThe difference now is he has realized that it can be his scam,\u201d said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrencies.",
      "Trump has pledged to turn the U.S. into the \u201ccrypto capital of the world\u201d and promised to roll back oversight of the industry.",
      "Deregulation, of course, will help his own businesses. At the height of the campaign, Trump announced the launch of his own crypto coin and World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm that would be run by his sons and several business associates. Among those partners was Steve Witkoff, now one of Trump\u2019s top diplomatic envoys.",
      "The Trump Organization and World Liberty Financial declined to comment.",
      "But it was also rooted in his 2024 campaign. At a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, he received assurances that industry figures would spend lavishly to get him reelected, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "Asked recently at the White House if he'd consider having his family business step back from its crypto investments to avoid questions about conflicts of interest, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve created a very powerful industry. That\u2019s much more important than anything that we invest in.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care about investing. You know, I have kids and they invest in it, because they do believe in it,\" Trump added of crypto. \"But I\u2019m president, and what I did do there was build an industry that\u2019s very important. And, if we didn\u2019t have it, China would.\u201d",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, reiterated that Trump's crypto boosterism isn't driven by self-interest.",
      "He \u201cis taking decisive action to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and to secure America\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leader in the digital asset economy,\u201d Fields said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration,\" Fields added, \"is fulfilling the president\u2019s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet by driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump is soon expected to sign cryptocurrency legislation approved by Congress on Thursday. Among the provisions is a ban on members of Congress issuing their own brand of a particular type of cryptocurrency. The prohibition does not extend to the president.",
      "Fields said it was unfair to equate critics\u2019 charges of conflicts of interest against Trump with the president\u2019s own suggestions that Biden\u2019s family benefited financially while he was in office.",
      "He said Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t benefited the president personally and have nothing to do with his family\u2019s financial concerns \u2014 and said Trump entered the White House an already successful businessman who didn\u2019t need a political career to become rich.",
      "Even so, Trump\u2019s family is poised to benefit financially from the crypto industry\u2019s growing clout. It holds a majority ownership stake that entitles them to 75% of earnings from their first coin, released last September, according to World Liberty Financial\u2019s website.",
      "The coin, $WLFI, was not an immediate success. Then, after the president's election, sales took off.",
      "Days before his inauguration, Trump announced a new meme coin, $Trump, during the \u201cCrypto Ball,\u201d a Washington gala intended to showcase a regulatory sea change he vowed to usher in.",
      "\u201cTime to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!\u201d Trump posted to his X account. \u201cJoin my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW.\u201d",
      "Often created as a joke with no real utility, meme coins are prone to wild price swings that often enrich a small group of insiders at the expense of less sophisticated investors. $Trump soared to over $70, but its price soon collapsed, losing money for many. It has hovered around $10 since March. Trump did well, though. By the end of April, the coin had earned over $320 million in fees, according to an analysis by the crypto tracking firm Chainalysis.",
      "A third cryptocurrency, a \u201cstablecoin\u201d called USD1, launched in April.",
      "There appear to be upsides for Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency investors and associates.",
      "Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire, has disclosed investing nearly $200 million in the Trumps' various crypto ventures. Amid this spree, the Trump administration announced it had paused a securities fraud case against him. In June, Sun announced he was taking his crypto company, Tron, public after securing financing through a deal brokered by Eric Trump. Last week, Sun posted on Twitter that he was purchasing an additional $100 million worth of Trump's meme coin.",
      "Sun is not the only one. Changpen Zhao, a convicted felon who founded the crypto exchange Binance, was part of a megadeal in which a United Arab Emirates-controlled wealth fund invested $2 billion in the Trump stablecoin, USD1, which it used to purchase a stake in Zhao\u2019s Binance.",
      "The deal gave outsized publicity to World Liberty Financial and instantly made the stablecoin one of the top in the market. It will also allow the Trump family and their business partners to reinvest the $2 billion and collect interest, estimated to be worth as much as $80 million a year.",
      "Soon after the purchase was announced, Trump granted the UAE greater access to U.S. artificial intelligence chips, which it had long sought. Binance and Zhao benefited, too.",
      "Binance is restricted in the U.S. and entered a settlement with the Biden administration that sent Zhao to jail in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an anti-money-laundering program. Prosecutors said he looked the other way as criminals used his platform to move money connected to child sex abuse, drug trafficking and terrorism.",
      "In May, Trump\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission dropped the final federal enforcement action against Binance. Zhao, who goes by CZ, is now seeking a pardon. The White House says no decision has been made on issuing such a grant of clemency.",
      "Trump announced several months ago a new promotion that would trade on his presidency: He was hosting a dinner at his Virginia golf club for the top 220 investors in his meme coin, $Trump, with a special White House tour for the top 25.",
      "That fueled a temporary rise in the coin's value. It also helped enrich the Trump Organization, which is entitled to collect fees when the coin is traded. A month later, Trump addressed attendees of the dinner, standing before a lectern with the presidential seal. The White House said at the time that it had nothing to do with the meme coin.",
      "For decades, campaign contributions and lobbying have been governed by laws that place limits on how much donors can give, require a degree of transparency and limit how politicians can spend the money they raise. Trump\u2019s venture into cryptocurrency effectively sidesteps these laws, legal and finance experts say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like the Trump Hotel from the first term, but what crypto has done is dispensed with the need for the hotel,\u201d said Allen, the law professor. \u201cBecause crypto assets can be made out of thin air, he has found a way of creating an unlimited supply of assets to offer to people who want to give.\u201d",

      "The European Union is targeting Russia with more sanctions over its war on Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union approved on Friday a new raft of sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine, including a lower oil price cap, a ban on transactions with Nord Stream gas pipelines, and the targeting of more shadow fleet ships, the EU foreign policy chief said.",
      "\u201cThe message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,\u201d Kaja Kallas said in a statement.",
      "Kallas said the measures amount to \u201cone of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date\u201d linked to the war, now in its fourth year. It comes as European countries start to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine to help the country better defend itself.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the new measures, describing them as a \u201ctimely and necessary\u201d step amid intensified Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cAll infrastructure of Russia\u2019s war must be blocked,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine will synchronize its sanctions with the EU and introduce its own additional measures soon.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, had proposed to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price to target Russia\u2019s vast energy revenues. The 27 member countries decided to set the price per barrel at just under $48.",
      "The EU had hoped to get major international powers in the Group of Seven countries involved in the price cap to broaden the impact, but conflict in the Middle East pushed up oil prices and the Trump administration could not be brought onboard.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.",
      "A new import ban was also imposed in an attempt to close a loophole allowing Russia to indirectly export crude oil via a number of non-EU countries.",
      "The EU also targeted the Nord Stream pipelines between Russia and Germany to prevent Putin from generating any revenue from them in future, notably by discouraging would-be investors. Russian energy giant Rosneft's refinery in India was hit as well.",
      "The pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were targeted by sabotage in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "On top of that, the new EU sanctions targeted Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. Two Chinese banks were added to the list.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 24, 2022.",
      "More than 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2014 often government agencies, banks, companies or organizations \u2014 have been hit with asset freezes and travel bans.",
      "But each round of sanctions is getting harder to agree, as measures targeting Russia bite the economies of the 27 member nations. Slovakia held up the latest package over concerns about proposals to stop Russian gas supplies, which it relies on.",
      "The last raft of EU sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers. On Friday, 105 more ships were blocked from European ports, locks and from ship-to-ship transfers, bringing the total number of vessels now sanctioned to more than 400.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage rose for the second week in a row, another setback for the U.S. housing market, which is mired in a sales slump as affordability constraints shut out prospective homebuyers",
      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage rose for the second week in a row, another setback for the U.S. housing market, which is mired in a sales slump as affordability constraints shut out prospective homebuyers.",
      "The long-term rate ticked up to 6.75% from 6.72% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.77%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate increased to 5.92% from 5.86% last week. A year ago, it was 6.05%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "When mortgage rates rise they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The main barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.45% at midday Thursday, down from 4.46% late Wednesday.",
      "Yields have largely moved higher this month as traders bet that a better-than-expected June jobs report could keep the Fed on hold when it comes to interest rates.",
      "Bond investors briefly drove longer-term yields higher Wednesday, after President Donald Trump said he had discussed the \u201cconcept\u201d of firing the chair of the Federal Reserve but was unlikely to do so.",
      "The president has been calling for Powell to cut interest rates. A less independent Fed could mean lower short-term rates, but it could have the opposite effect on the longer-term bond yields that influence the rates on home loans.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "The rise in mortgage rates appears to have discouraged some home shoppers. Mortgage applications fell 10% last week from a week earlier as higher rates and economic uncertainty dampened demand, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The pounding and squeak of Nikes on the drive downcourt sets the soundtrack and the stadium lights kick in as the sun sets. Bodies tussle for the rebound on a missed three-pointer and men shout for the assist on a sweaty summer night.",
      "This is the Goodman League, in the heart of Southeast Washington\u2019s Barry Farm neighborhood. Cigarette smoke from the audience floats across the court, mixing with the smell of fried fish for sale just off courtside.",
      "This is the place to be seen in the neighborhood; the bleachers are packed and others sit in picnic chairs all around the court. The crowd\u2019s attire ranges from trendy fashion, rhinestone sunglasses and high heels to backwards baseball caps, tank tops and baggy shorts.",

      "The land here, which was originally owned by slave owner James Barry until early 1868, has changed over the last 16 years. The notorious Barry Farm housing complex exists now only as piles of rubble, overgrown with weeds and grass and surrounded by a cyclone fence. A new condo complex offers views of where rows of nondescript brick apartments used to stand.",
      "What remains of the old neighborhood are the basketball courts of the Goodman League, revamped in 1996 by Miles Rawls. This is where the old Barry Farm Community Summer Basketball League operated from its founding in 1977 to 1995. Now under Rawls\u2019 oversight, it remains a family-friendly community hub and neighborhood magnet.",
      "The referees, like the players, are a motley crew \u2014 jolly and occasionally out of breath as they try to keep pace with young men who hail from vastly different levels of the game. Players come here from across the so-called DMV \u2014 the local term for the intertwined communities of D.C., northern Virginia and southern Maryland.",
      "From local streetball legends to rising high school and college prospects, these courts have even showcased the occasional future NBA legend, like D.C.-area native Kevin Durant.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s the kids, the comradery, the getting everybody together from different parts of the city, different parts of the DMV,\u201d Rawls said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call a safe haven.\u201d",
      "In one of the poorest and most crime-ridden parts of the nation\u2019s capital, Rawls\u2019 also knows that offering a bit of alternative recreation can have a deep sociological impact. He has no illusions about what some of his regular players \u201cwould be doing if they weren\u2019t here for three or four hours a day six days a week ... that\u2019s what pretty much drives me,\u201d he said.",
      "More than two decades after he first started, Rawls looks at the court and ongoing daily pickup games as his life\u2019s work and legacy.",
      "\u201cIt uplifts me man, to be honest with you. It brings tears to my eyes, 29 years later I\u2019m still relevant, still on top. That\u2019s a long time to do anything, in the hood, in one of the worst neighborhoods and wards in D.C.,\u201c he said. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t trade it for nothing.\u201d",

      "U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee leaders are pushing lawmakers for tweaks to legislation that would regulate college sports by adding guarantees that schools will spend the same percentage on Olympic programs in the future as they do now.",
      "USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland told The Associated Press on Monday that a letter she and chair Gene Sykes sent to members of Congress last week was intended to restart a conversation about the SCORE Act, which currently calls for schools to sponsor at least 16 teams.",
      "That's a number that conforms with current NCAA rules for Power Four schools, and one that Hirshland worries would give schools no incentive to fund non-revenue sports that power the Olympic pipeline.",
      "\u201cYou look and you say, \u2018Is that effectively going to thwart the issue of allocating too many resources to football and not enough to other things?\u2019 And my assessment is, no, it's not going to do that,\u201d Hirshland said.",
      "The USOPC says all but three of the 67 Power Four schools sponsor more than 16 sports and the average school in that group has more than 21.",
      "At last year\u2019s Paris Olympics, 75% of U.S. Olympians and 53% of Paralympians had a connection with U.S. college sports.",
      "The SCORE Act recently passed a House subcommittee and is set for markup this week, a process in which lawmakers amend certain facets of the bill. Hirshland said USOPC leadership has long been in discussions about adding provisions that would compel schools to spend at least the same percentage on Olympic sports as they do now.",
      "\u201cThe bill, as it's written, would make it too easy for a school to starve 15 programs and invest in one,\u201d Hirshland said. \u201cIt's important schools have the latitude to make decisions that are most effective for the school, but while also creating an environment that says \u2018You don\u2019t just need to be a football school.'\u201d",
      "She said she was encouraged that lawmakers were including provisions for protecting Olympic sports in a bill that would regulate the shifting college landscape.",
      "The SCORE Act proposes to provide limited antitrust protection for the NCAA and would place the college sports' name, image, likeness system under one federal law instead of a mishmash of state regulations.",
      "Starting this month, schools are allowed to pay up to $20.5 million to athletes in NIL deals. Most of that money will be funneled to football and basketball players, whose sports generate the bulk of college athletics revenue. It has left many to wonder about the future of the Olympic programs.",
      "The act also includes a section that purports to protect Olympic sports with the 16-team minimum, but in the letter to House leaders, Sykes and Hirshland were skeptical of that.",
      "\u201cThe USOPC is committed to being a partner in this process and would welcome the opportunity to share further insights, data, and recommendations,\u201d they wrote.",
      "It also mandates that athletes not be turned into employees of their schools, a sticking point for some Democrats that figures to keep the bill from moving along in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to pass.",
      "Hirshland said the USOPC hasn't taken a \u201cstrong position\u201d on the employment issue, and is mostly concerned that any legislation includes strong protection for Olympic sports.",
      "She says the USOPC-backed idea of keeping spending at certain percentages isn't the only answer to the issue, but might be the simplest and best.",
      "\u201cWe don't want schools to starve Olympic sports by cutting them or starving them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want them to continue to provide investment in the growth of these sports.\u201d",

    "summary": "The more Scottie Scheffler keeps winning, the more comparisons there are to Tiger Woods",
    "story": [
      "The more Scottie Scheffler keeps winning, the more comparisons there are to Tiger Woods",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Another comparison between Tiger Woods and Scottie Scheffler surfaced during the final round of the British Open. This one wasn't about numbers or trophies, but a fist pump.",
      "And it was for par.",
      "Scheffler only needed one hour to expand his four-shot lead to seven shots with a steady diet of fairways and greens at Royal Portrush on Sunday, along with three birdie putts. But he missed his tee shot on the par-3 sixth and his chip was weak, leaving him a 15-foot par putt.",
      "Scheffler fiercely pumped his fist when it dropped, evoking memories of Woods and his 15-shot win at Pebble Beach in the 2000 U.S. Open.",
      "Woods had a 12-foot par putt on the 16th hole of that final round, and it was the most emotion he showed all day when he made it. He wanted a clean card and wound up going his final 26 holes bogey-free. Woods was so utterly dominant his only competition came from himself.",
      "That's how it felt with Scheffler when he won the claret jug for the third leg of the career Grand Slam at Royal Portrush.",
      "Scheffler went 32 holes without a bogey until he took two shots to get out of a fairway bunker on No. 8 and made double bogey. What stood out to Scheffler in his four-shot victory was the lack of bogeys, the DNA of his dominance.",
      "\u201cTo only have one double \u2014 really one one over-par hole in the last 36 holes of a major championship \u2014 that's how you're able to win these tournaments,\u201d he said.",
      "He won the British Open by four shots. He won the PGA Championship in May by five shots. He won by four in the 2024 Masters. Scheffler was five shots ahead on the final hole in his first Masters win in 2022 when he four-putted while simply trying to finish.",
      "There are plenty of numbers to consider, starting with his position at No. 1 in the world. No one has held it longer since Woods.",
      "Scheffler and Woods are the only players in the last 50 years to win two majors in the same year by at least four shots. Researchers with time on their hands at the PGA Tour discovered Scheffler and Woods each went 1,197 days between winning their first and fourth majors.",
      "Enough of the comparisons, Scheffler said.",
      "\u201cI still think they're a bit silly,\u201d he said. \u201cTiger won, what, 15 majors? This is my fourth. I just got one-fourth of the way there. I think Tiger stands alone in the game of golf. He was inspirational for me growing up. He was a very, very talented guy, and he was a special person to be able to be as good as he was at the game of golf.\u201d",
      "For majors alone, a better comparison would be with Rory McIlroy. He also won four majors in three years, including two of them in 2014. McIlroy won a U.S. Open and a PGA Championship by eight shots, the latter a record margin.",
      "And then he went 11 years without a major. Greatness in golf is also about longevity.",
      "Scheffler won for the fourth time this year and now has 20 victories worldwide. He has won 11 straight times with the 54-hole lead.",
      "The 29 year old from Texas was introduced as champion golfer of the year, a title the R&A has used for more than a century. Scheffler at this rate might be champion golfer of his generation.",
      "And to think he was slowed at the start of the year recovering from a puncture wound on his right hand from trying to cut ravioli with a wine glass.",
      "The year's top highlight still might be McIlroy winning the Masters amid tense drama to finally complete the Grand Slam. That was his third win of the season, following The Players Championship and Pebble Beach. McIlroy, however, sounded almost dismissive about them Sunday evening.",
      "\u201cI also had the three wins when Scottie wasn't quite on his game,\u201d he said.",
      "Also driving the comparisons with Woods are high praise from just about everyone who has had to face Scheffler since that first win in 2022.",
      "\u201cHe is the bar that we\u2019re all trying to get to,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we thought the golfing world would see someone as dominant as Tiger come through so soon, and here\u2019s Scottie sort of taking that throne of dominance,\u201d Xander Schauffele said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even say he\u2019s on a run. He\u2019s just been killing it for over two years now.\u201d",
      "Any hesitation about comparisons \u2014 besides the 15-4 tally in majors, as Scheffler is quick to point out \u2014 is their style of play. Woods was as dynamic as he was relentless, especially with recovery shots. Scheffler doesn't have that many because he's rarely out of position.",
      "Woods was groomed for stardom when he appeared on the Mike Douglas Show at age 2. Scheffler never cared about anything other than playing golf and getting better at it.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care to be a superstar. He\u2019s not transcending the game like Tiger did. He\u2019s not bringing it to a non-golf audience necessarily,\u201d said Jordan Spieth. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to go do the stuff that a lot of us go do, corporately, anything like that.\u201d",
      "He works. He competes. He wins. That's what Woods did, and that's what matters to Scheffler.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t focus on that kind of stuff,\u201d Scheffler said of the comparisons. \"That\u2019s not what motivates me. I\u2019m not motivated by winning championships. I don\u2019t look at the beginning of the year and just say, \u2018I want to win X amount of tournaments.\u2019 I don\u2019t do that.",
      "\u201cWhen I wake up to practice, what motivates me is getting to live out my dream,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to play professional golf, and I feel like I\u2019m called to do it to the best of my ability.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- NFLPA chief strategy officer JC Tretter is resigning from his position, three days after Lloyd Howell stepped down as executive director of the players\u2019 union.",

      "\u201cOver the last couple days, it has gotten very, very hard for my family. And that\u2019s something I can\u2019t deal with,\u201d Tretter told CBS Sports on Sunday. \u201cSo, the short bullet points are: I have no interest in being (executive director). I have no interest in being considered. I\u2019ve let the executive committee know that. I\u2019m also going to leave the NFLPA in the coming days because I don\u2019t have anything left to give the organization.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m not resigning because what I\u2019ve been accused of is true,\u201d Tretter said. \u201cI\u2019m not resigning in disgrace. I\u2019m resigning because this has gone too far for me and my family, and I\u2019ve sucked it up for six weeks. And I felt like I\u2019ve been kind of left in the wind taking shots for the best of the organization. ... And in the end, what\u2019s the organization done for me? Like, nothing.\u201d",

      "Hamlin can eliminate distractions and succeed like few drivers in the series can can do: He shook off a setback in his court battle with NASCAR, shrugged off old tire concerns once he took a late lead ahead of a rain delay, and survived a late charge from his teammate to go back-to-back at Dover Motor Speedway for the Joe Gibbs Racing driver\u2019s series-best fourth victory of the season.",
      "\u201cI just love that I'm able to still do it at a high level,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cEvery morning when I wake up, I just hope I still got what I had yesterday.\u201d",
      "Hamlin won in the No. 11 Toyota for the second straight time at Dover to add to wins this season at Martinsville, Darlington and Michigan.",
      "Hamlin has 58 NASCAR Cup Series victories, leaving him two short of Kevin Harvick for 10th on the career list. The veteran Virginia driver might hit that mark this season as he chases his first career Cup championship.",
      "Hamlin is on NASCAR's short list of greatest drivers to never win a championship. He won't let the void on an otherwise stellar resume full of Hall of Fame credentials define how he feels about his career.",
      "Hamlin says, it's trophies, not titles, not he celebrates the most",
      "\u201cIf we do, we do. If we don't, we don't,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cI care about wins. I want more trophies, more trophies, more trophies. When I'm done, I want to be in the list of that top-10 all-time winners. That will mean more than any other accomplishment.\u201d",
      "Hamlin took the checkered flag days after he suffered a setback in court with his own 23XI Racing team\u2019s federal antitrust suit against NASCAR.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge rejected a request from 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports to continue racing with charters while they battle NASCAR in court, meaning their six cars will race as open entries this weekend at Dover, next week at Indianapolis and perhaps longer than that in a move the teams say would put them at risk of going out of business.",
      "Hamlin vowed this weekend \u201call will be exposed\u201d if the case goes to its scheduled Dec. 1 trial date.",
      "The courtroom drama hasn\u2019t affected Hamlin\u2019s performance on the track. Hamlin held off JGR teammate Chase Briscoe for the victory. Hendrick Motorsports drivers took the next two spots, with Alex Bowman third and Kyle Larson fourth.",
      "\u201cI thought I did everything I needed to,\u201d Briscoe said. \u201cI thought I had him there for a second. I wish the Camry, the back, was about 3 inches shorter. I was so close to clearing him. I just couldn\u2019t do it. Obviously, racing a teammate, I wanted to make sure at least a JGR car won.\u201d",
      "Hamlin held off Kyle Larson down the stretch last season to earn the second of his three career wins at the Monster Mile.",
      "The first July Cup race at Dover since 1969 started with steamy weather and drivers battled the conditions inside the car during a relatively clean race until rain fell late and red-flagged the race with 14 laps left. Hamlin said the during the break changed his firesuit \u2014 temperatures inside the car soared to 140 degrees, and sweat kept dripping inside his visor.",
      "He also returned to the car after the 56-minute delay with old tires. Hamlin \u2014 who was the betting favorite to win, per BETMGM Sportsbook \u2014- had enough to win on cool tires at Dover and park the Toyota in victory lane.",
      "There was never any real consideration to pit with the lead for fresh tires.",
      "\u201cWe need wins,\u201d crew chief Chris Gayle said. \u201cHow can we manufacture some way to give ourselves more opportunity for that to happen? Might not pan out, but we definitely weren\u2019t going to do it doing the same thing as everybody else. That was our train of thought there and thankfully it worked out and we held on.\u201d",
      "He became the 19th Cup driver to win three times at Dover and the 13th driver to win consecutive races on the mile concrete track.",
      "\u201cI just studied some of the greats here,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cI was very fortunate to have Martin Truex as a teammate. Jimmie Johnson, watching him win (11) times here. You learn from the greats and you change your game to match it, you have success like this.\u201d",
      "The Tys have it in NASCAR.",
      "It\u2019s Ty Gibbs vs. Ty Dillon next week at Indianapolis to decide the first winner in NASCAR\u2019s $1 million mid-season tournament.",
      "NASCAR seeded 32 drivers for the first In-season Challenge, a five-race, bracket-style tournament that mirrors the NCAA basketball tournaments.",
      "Both drivers are winless and Dillon made it as the No. 32 seed. Gibbs finished fifth Sunday for JGR.",
      "John Hunter Nemechek and Tyler Reddick were eliminated.",
      "Joey Logano finished 14th for Team Penske in his 600th career start.",
      "Logano has made every start since the 2009, 597 straight, putting him within striking distance of Jeff Gordon\u2019s Cup record of 797 straight starts.",
      "Logano was 35 years, 1 month, 26 days old when he hits No. 600 on Sunday, making him the youngest driver to reach that milestone. He topped seven-time NASCAR champion and Hall of Famer Richard Petty by six months.",
      "Petty is the only driver to have won his 600th start.",
      "It's off to Indianapolis Motor Speedway where Kyle Larson won last season on the oval after a four-year break on the road course.",

      "Rory McIlroy's legion of fans came in hope more than expectation to the final day of the British Open at Royal Portrush",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland (AP) \u2014 Scottie Scheffler was walking down the first fairway at Royal Portrush when a shout came from outside the ropes: \u201cGo Rory!\u201d",
      "They were all over the Dunluce Links again Sunday, those passionate supporters of Rory McIlroy cheering on their favorite son in the final act of his homecoming \u2014 whether they were watching him or not.",
      "The big disappointment for McIlroy was that he couldn\u2019t deliver what they craved.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an awesome week,\u201d McIlroy said after shooting 2-under 69 to tie for seventh at the British Open. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten everything I wanted out of this week apart from a claret jug, and that\u2019s just because one person was just a little bit better than the rest of us.\u201d",
      "That might be an understatement.",
      "Scheffler, the world No. 1, won by four shots to capture his fourth major title. He was seven strokes clear of McIlroy and playing on a different level in this pretty corner of Northern Ireland.",
      "McIlroy even acknowledged as much.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an incredible player,\u201d he said of Scheffler. \u201cHe\u2019s been dominant this week. Honestly, he\u2019s been dominant for the last couple years. He is the bar that we\u2019re all trying to get to.\u201d",
      "As for Scheffler, he could only apologize for spoiling the McIlroy party.",
      "\u201cI know I wasn\u2019t the fan favorite today,\u201d he said, grinning, in his post-round speech on No. 18, \u201cbut I did hear a lot of USA and Dallas, Texas chants.\u201d",
      "Scheffler might have won two majors this year and asserted himself as the game\u2019s dominant player. Yet, for many, 2025 still belongs to McIlroy after his dramatic win at the Masters in April to complete the career Grand Slam.",
      "Fans came in droves this week to celebrate McIlroy\u2019s achievements, and produced some of the loudest roars he has ever heard on a golf course.",
      "If McIlroy didn\u2019t quite deliver, then Royal Portrush \u2014 where he shot 61 as a 16-year-old for the course record \u2014 certainly did, gaining widespread rave reviews.",
      "When the Open returned to Portrush in 2019 for the first time in 68 years, McIlroy was so emotional he hit his opening drive out-of-bounds, shot 79 and missed the cut.",
      "He made amends six years later.",
      "\u201cI feel so thankful and just so lucky that I get to do this in front of this crowd,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll have one or two Opens left here, if the R&A decide to keep coming back \u2014 probably one while I\u2019m still competitive and another one while I\u2019m more gray than I already am.\u201d",
      "McIlroy started Sunday six strokes back from Scheffler after a wild third-round 66, and needed a minor miracle to catch his big rival.",
      "He got up-and-down for birdie at the par-5 second hole but couldn\u2019t make a fast enough start. A bogey at No. 4, after missing the green with his approach, was a mistake he couldn\u2019t afford and he suddenly was eight shots adrift of Scheffler, who played as steady as ever.",
      "A double at No. 10 ended his hopes.",
      "McIlroy couldn\u2019t reproduce his Saturday charge but at least played all four days this time.",
      "\u201cI tried as best as I could to keep my emotions in check, especially walking up the last there and that reception,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just been incredible to come back here and to play and at least feel like I had a chance today going out there. Just an awesome week.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Venus Williams is back on the tennis scene, ready to compete for the first time in more than a year, and while she smiled or laughed frequently Sunday while discussing her return at the DC Open, there was something that would make her even happier: if her younger sister Serena were along for the ride.",
      "\u201cI keep saying to my team: The only thing that would make this better is if she was here. Like, we always did everything together, so of course I miss her,\u201d Venus said when asked about a recent video on social media that showed Serena swinging a racket. \u201cBut if she comes back, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll let y\u2019all know.\u201d",
      "That, of course, was said with a wide grin. Serena, 43, hasn't played since the 2022 U.S. Open, when she declared she was \u201cevolving\u201d away from the sport she dominated for stretches on the way to 23 Grand Slam singles titles and an additional 14 in doubles with Venus.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do. I don\u2019t ask those questions,\" Venus said a day before the hard-court tournament in the nation's capital begins. \"I think we always hit the ball, because that\u2019s who we are. We\u2019re always hitting.\u201d",
      "She said it was during a recent practice session of hers that Serena showed up and joined in for about 15 or 20 minutes.",
      "\u201cShe can take six months off and she clocks it clean,\u201d Venus said. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach that kind of talent. She\u2019s just so good.\u201d",
      "They both were the best around at one point.",
      "Both reached No. 1 in the rankings. Venus, who turned 45 last month, won seven major singles championships, two at the U.S. Open and five at Wimbledon.",
      "Her last tournament was in March 2024 at the Miami Open, where she exited in the first round. It's been so long that the official WTA Tour website lists her as \u201cinactive.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is very special for me to come back and play tennis,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a surprise for the fans \u2014 and a surprise in general, as I hold my cards tight.\u201d",
      "Sure does.",
      "It came as a bit of a shock to the tennis world when her appearance in Washington via a wild-card invitation was announced a week ago.",
      "Her team had reached out to DC Open chairman Mark Ein via text in April to gauge whether he'd be open to having Venus at an event she last entered in 2022. He said he needed two seconds to reply: \u201cOf course.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s such an icon of the sport \u2014 and, importantly, both on and off the court,\u201d Ein said in an interview. \u201cSo anytime you can have her engaged and have the spotlight on her and everything she\u2019s done and continues to do, it\u2019s hugely positive.\u201d",
      "What did she miss the most while away from the tour?",
      "\u201cAll the times that I had and, of course, the adrenaline, all those things,\u201d Venus said. \u201cJust the pure fun of playing the game, the fun of the challenge, overcoming \u2014 when you play, you overcome so many challenges: your opponents, the conditions, a lot of times you have to overcome yourself. Those things are very exciting.\u201d",
      "When asked why she's getting back on court, Venus offered a simple response: \u201cWhy not?\u201d",
      "As for whether this is a one-stop tour or she plans to play elsewhere, she wasn't prepared to say much.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just here for now, and who knows?\u201d Venus said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s more. ... But at the moment, I\u2019m focused just on this. I haven\u2019t played in a year. There is no doubt I can play tennis, but obviously coming back to play matches, it takes time to get in the swing of things. I definitely feel I\u2019ll play well. I\u2019m still the same player. I\u2019m a big hitter. I hit big. This is my brand.\u201d",

      "McIlroy already is the Masters champion, the sixth player to win the career slam, and he has been in a far more relaxed mood before adoring fans.",

      "\u201cTokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,\u201d said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France.",
      "Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors.",
      "But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century\u2019s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",
      "The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast.",
      "She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television.",
      "\u201cYou used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,\u201d Haun said. \u201cYou tune in at a specific time, you don\u2019t get to choose your program, you couldn\u2019t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.\u201d",
      "Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.",
      "Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",
      "Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike.",
      "\u201cWhich is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,\u201d Reiners said.",
      "Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday.",
      "\u201cTokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,\u201d said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins.",
      "Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country\u2019s securities law.",
      "Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law.",
      "Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer.",
      "\u201cThe most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,\u201d she said.",
      "However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood\u2019s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider \u201ctheir disclosure obligations\u201d under federal law.",
      "\u201cAs powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,\u201d Peirce said.",
      "One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren\u2019t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones.",
      "Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private.",
      "That\u2019s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization.",
      "\u201cThese are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,\u201d said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. \u201cCrypto has the power to solve this inequality.\u201d",
      "But Robinhood\u2019s giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood\u2019s plan and did not endorse it.",

      "Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don\u2019t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is \u201ceerily familiar\u201d to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago.",
      "\u201cWhere we\u2019re headed is where we were in the 1920s,\u201d she said. \u201cDoor-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",
      "\u201cDead hives aren\u2019t pollinating the almonds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real ripple effect that stems back from the heat in the summertime.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget would eliminate the research program that funds the USGS Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation\u2019s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.",
      "U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said America\u2019s pollinators are in \u201cgrave danger,\u201d and he'll fight for the federal funding. Pollinators contribute to the health of the planet, the crops we grow and the food we eat, he said.",
      "\u201cRather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,\u201d he said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",
      "\u201cHopefully, even if such research is defunded in the U.S., such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,\u201d said Harrison.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",
      "The California case is expected to last another four days.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",
      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",

      "Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming around a baby sun-like star",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system\u2019s planets.",
      "The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, \u201cso we didn\u2019t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system,\u201d McClure said in an email. \u201cOur study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.\u201d",
      "While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there\u2019s been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.",
      "In a stunning picture taken by the ESO's Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many planets might form around HOPS-315. With a gas disk as massive as the sun\u2019s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.",
      "Purdue University\u2019s Merel van \u2019t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.",
      "\u201cAre there Earth-like planets out there or are we like so special that we might not expect it to occur very often?\"",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",
      "\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be enough liquid to seep through cracks in the shell, and their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap and water,\u201d he said.",
      "For laptop screens or external monitors, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away fingerprint smudges.",
      "If there are more stubborn spots \u2014 like food stains or sneezy spatters \u2014 dampen the cloth with distilled water or a 50/50 solution of distilled water and vinegar.",
      "Computer maker Lenovo says the \u201cgentle acidity of vinegar can help break down oils and fingerprints.\u201d Avoid using household glass cleaners, which can contain ammonia that could damage the screen. The same goes for paper towels, which can scratch the screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol.",
      "A lot of people listen to music or podcasts through their earbuds, but that also means they'll need regular cleaning to remove any earwax, natural skin oils or other grungy buildup.",
      "If the earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending on your brand and model. Logitech and Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water or wet wipes because they can speed deterioration, and, instead, advises using a dry cloth.",
      "Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean.",
      "Owners of Apple AirPods need to follow a much more elaborate procedure to clean the mesh. You'll need a child's toothbrush, two small cups, a paper towel, distilled water, as well as micellar water \u2014 typically used as a facial cleanser.",
      "Pour some micellar water into a cup, dip the toothbrush, brush the AirPod's various mesh parts, and then blot them dry with the paper. Repeat twice. Then repeat that procedure but using the distilled water to rinse off the micellar water. Finally, let the AirPods dry for at least two hours.",
      "To clean the rest of the AirPod's body, use a damp cloth. And don't forget about the charging case. Apple recommends brushing out any debris and then wiping with a dry cloth. If needed, dampen it with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "What about over-the-ear headphones? Bose says you should wipe them down at least once a week, especially after working out, to remove any dirt and bacteria hiding in the nooks and crannies. Remove the pads and use a cloth dampened with soapy water to clean them.",
      "Apple has issued specific instructions on its website for cleaning various iPhone models. Samsung has posted similar guidelines for its Galaxy lineup.",
      "They both advise using a soft, lint-free cloth, such as a lens cleaning cloth, to gently wipe the outside of the phone. Apple warns against using any cleaning products, which could erode the oil-repellent coating that most iPhones come with.",
      "Both companies say it\u2019s OK to use disinfectants such as rubbing alcohol to gently clean the exterior, but avoid bleach or hydrogen peroxide.",

      "Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",
      "Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.",
      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cThis area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,\u201d he said.",

      "Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said \u201ceverything that has to do with ensuring the safety of citizens, everything is justified and everything is a priority.\u201d",
      "Russians from affected regions say the outages can last for hours or days; patterns also are hard to discern, with service working in one part of a city but vanishing elsewhere.",
      "In Voronezh, near Ukraine and frequently targeted by drones, one resident said she felt like she was in \u201ca cave\u201d in early July with no cellphone internet or Wi-Fi in her home. The woman, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said she was only able to get online at work the next day.",
      "Cellphone internet in the southwestern city of Samara \"goes out at the most unpredictable moments,\u201d said Natalia, who also spoke on condition that her last name be withheld for safety reasons. Her home Wi-Fi recently also has slowed to a near halt around 11 p.m., staying that way for a few hours, she said.",
      "Connectivity has improved recently in the Siberian city of Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko, who owns retail stores and other businesses there. But cellphone internet service was out in his office for an entire week. A few of his smaller stores that rely on cellphone networks suffered disruptions, but nothing critical, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel any super strong discomfort,\" said Grigori Khromov of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia\u2019s fifth-largest city where regular and widespread shutdowns were reported. \"I have an office job and I work either at home or in the office and have either wire internet or Wi-Fi.\u201d",
      "In rural areas, small towns and villages, where cellphone internet often is the only way to get online, the situation was harder to gauge.",
      "Pharmacies in such areas have struggled, Russian media reported and the Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed to AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head of the association, said in a statement that prescriptions must be logged in special software, but that becomes impossible without an internet connection for weeks.",
      "A social media user in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained on Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov\u2019s social media page that without cellphone internet and a working alarm system, village residents have to bang on a rail to warn neighbors of an attack. The authorities promised to look into improving connectivity in the area.",
      "Authorities elsewhere also announced steps to minimize disruptions by opening Wi-Fi spots. They also are reportedly planning to establish an agency to coordinate the shutdowns, according to Izvestia, a Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said he was unaware of the plan.",
      "Russian and Ukrainian drones use cellphone internet networks to operate, so shutdowns are one way authorities try to counter the attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.",
      "But it's also part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to rein in the internet. Authorities have actively censored online content in the last decade, blocking thousands of websites of independent media, opposition groups and human rights organizations.",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as encrypted messenger platform Signal and a few other messaging apps.",
      "Access to YouTube \u2014 wildly popular in Russia \u2014 was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia.",
      "State internet watchdogs routinely block virtual private network services that help circumvent the restrictions, and there are plans to introduce a national messenger app, expected to replace foreign ones.",
      "Along with the shutdowns, these are part of a larger campaign \u201cto establish control over the internet, which is something the Kremlin had failed to do 20 years prior on the same level that China did,\u201d said the ISW's Stepanenko.",
      "Access Now's Zhyrmont says it's \u201cvery disturbing\u201d that Russians have gotten used to living with growing internet restrictions, including shutdowns.",

      "The Trump administration has revoked $4 billion in federal funding for California's long-delayed high speed rail project",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program.",
      "President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a \u201ctrain to nowhere.\"",
      "\u201cThe Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.\u201d",
      "The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports.",
      "It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back.",
      "State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project.",
      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cCanceling these grants without cause isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\"",
      "The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep \u201call options on the table\u201d to fight the revocation of federal funds.",
      "\u201cTrump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won\u2019t let him,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The state has \u201cno viable plan\u201d to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a \u201cstory of broken promises\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents \u201coverwhelmingly believe\u201d high-speed rail spending \u201chas been irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",
      "The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail.",
      "The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that.",

      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",
      "But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it\u2019s happening.",
      "\u201cThey know this is profoundly important what\u2019s happening in this \u2018Age of Intelligence,\u2019 but they want to understand better what it is, how it\u2019s developed, where are the important choices being made and who\u2019s making them?\u201d he said.",
      "Zingale said the commission chose early on not to interact with Altman in any way in order to maintain their independence, though they quote him in their report. However, they did speak with the company\u2019s senior engineers, who they said, \u201centered our space with humility, seriousness, and a genuine desire to understand how their work might translate into democratic legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources to the nonprofit for use in the public interest. For context, the nonprofit reported $23 million in assets in 2023, the most recent year that its tax filing is available.",
      "The commission recommend focusing on closing gaps in economic opportunity, investing in AI literacy and creating an organization that is accessible to and governed by everyday people.",
      "\u201cFor OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to fulfill its mandate, it should commit to more than just doing good - it should commit to being known, seen, and shaped by the people it claims to serve,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The commission suggested opening a rapid response fund to help reduce economic strains now. Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater, art and health.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to make the point that they need to dedicate some of their resources to human to human activities,\u201d he said.",
      "The commission also recommended setting up a requirement that a human lead the nonprofit, which Zingale said is a serious recommendation and \u201ca sign of the times.\"",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "A coalition of philanthropic funders will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools to help spur economic mobility",
      "A coalition of funders, including the Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group, will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations.",
      "The funders announced Thursday that they will create a new entity, NextLadder Ventures, to offer grants and investments to nonprofits and for-profits to develop tools for those who often manage huge caseloads with few resources.",
      "\u201cThe solutions that we\u2019re investing in, the hundreds of entrepreneurs that are going to bring forward solutions that incorporate leading edge technologies, are going to do it by coming alongside people who are living through some of the struggles in the economy,\u201d said Brian Hooks, CEO of Stand Together, a nonprofit started by Kansas-based billionaire Charles Koch.",
      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group. He will also serve as a member on NextLadder's board, which will include three independent board members and representatives from the other funders.",
      "NextLadder will be led by Ryan Rippel, who previously directed the Gates Foundation's economic mobility portfolio. The funder group has not yet determined if NextLadder will incorporate as a nonprofit or a for profit organization but said any returns they make from investments will go back into funding new initiatives.",
      "NextLadder will partner with AI company Anthropic, which will offer technical expertise and access to its technologies to the nonprofits and companies it invests in. Anthropic has committed around $1.5 million annually to the partnership, said Elizabeth Kelly, its head of beneficial deployments, which is a team that focuses on giving back to society.",
      "\u201cWe want to hand-hold grantees through their use of Claude with the same care and commitment we provide to our largest enterprise customers,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Anthropic's large language model.",
      "Hooks, of Stand Together, said philanthropy can reduce the riskiness of these types of investments and offer organizations more time to prove out their ideas.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, this will be the first capital to demonstrate what\u2019s possible,\u201d Hooks said.",
      "Researchers like those at the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in humanitarian action have studied some of the risks associated with using AI tools when interacting with sensitive populations or handling high-stakes interactions, for example, in humanitarian contexts.",
      "They recommend assessing whether AI is the best tool to solve the problem and, crucially, if it works reliably and accurately enough in high-risk settings. They also recommend assessing tools for bias, considering privacy protections and weighing the cost of potential dependence on a specific provider.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology also emphasizes that trustworthy AI systems should be accountable to users and that it should be possible to explain or trace how a tool arrived at a certain conclusion or decision.",
      "Hooks emphasized that any AI tools NextLadder invests in will be shaped by the needs and feedback of these frontline workers. Tools that don't work for them, won't succeed, he said. Even with the potential risks of AI tools, he said it's imperative that groups that are struggling to move up the economic ladder have access to new technologies.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we would deprive those who are struggling in our country from the benefits of the leading edge solutions is unacceptable,\u201d Hooks said.",

    "story": [
      "San Jose\u2019s mayor is using AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline city operations and improve services for its 1 million residents",
      "Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.",
      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",
      "Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings.",
      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",
      "ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission.",
      "In Fresno, California, a school official was forced to resign after saying she was too trusting of an AI chatbot that fabricated information in a document.",
      "While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn to chatbots for help, Mahan is open about his ChatGPT-written background memos that he turns to when making speeches.",
      "\u201cHistorically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,\" he said. \"You can knock out these tasks at a similar or better level of quality in a lot less time.\u201d",
      "He added, however, that \"you still need a human being in the loop. You can\u2019t just kind of press a couple of buttons and trust the output. You still have to do some independent verification. You have to have logic and common sense and ask questions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such \u201cAI agents\" is now a key focus for the tech industry.",
      "More than an hour's drive east of Silicon Valley, where the Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director of information technology at the city of Stockton, had big visions for what he could do with such an agent.",
      "Perhaps the parks and recreation department could let an AI agent help residents book a public park or swimming pool for a birthday party. Or residents could find out how crowded the pool was before packing their swim clothes.",
      "Six months later, however, after completing a proof-of-concept phase, the city didn't buy a full license for the technology due to the cost.",
      "The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40% of \u201cagentic AI\u201d projects will be canceled before the end of 2027, \u201cdue to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.\u201d",
      "San Jose's mayor remains bullish about the potential for these AI tools to help workers \u201cin the bowels of bureaucracy\u201d to rapidly speed up their digital paperwork.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just an amazing amount of bureaucracy that large organizations have to have,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s finance, accounting, HR or grant writing, those are the kinds of roles where we think our employees can be 20 (to) 50% more productive -- quickly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.",

    "story": [
      "China's Ministry of State Security says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it says threaten national security",
      "BANGKOK -- China's state security agency says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths minerals that it says threaten national security, just weeks after Beijing and Washington agreed to make it easier for American firms to obtain from China those materials, which are critical for manufacturing and computer chip production.",
      "In a report published Friday in the state-run newspaper Global Times, the Ministry of State Security said foreign \u201cespionage and intelligence agencies\u201d were colluding to steal rare earths-related goods by repackaging and relabeling rare metals to hide their Chinese origin.",
      "In some cases the minerals were falsely declared as non-controlled items, mislabeled as such things as \u201csolder paste,\u201d mixed into other materials like ceramic tiles, or hidden in plastic mannequins or bottled water, it said.",
      "It referred only to an unnamed \u201ccertain country\u201d that it said lacked the capacity to make and refine its own rare earths.",
      "Investigations had found Chinese criminals were involved, exploiting shipping and delivery channels to evade controls on exports of the materials used in many high-tech applications including electric vehicle batteries, it said.",
      "The crackdown followed a report by Reuters earlier this month detailing how rare earths were being transshipped to the U.S. via Thailand and Mexico.",
      "China is the main source for many strategically vital rare earths and it has moved to slow exports of such minerals in retaliation for steep import duties President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods since he returned to the White House and launched his crusade to overturn a global trading system he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "That followed an earlier series of restrictions by Beijing on exports of such materials as gallium, germanium, antimony and tungsten in response to trade friction with the administration of then-President Joe Biden.",
      "In April, Beijing imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements, under a Chinese law that applies to all exports, not just those bound for the U.S. market.",
      "With the permitting process taking 45 days, the new requirement caused a pause in shipments, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world. The U.S., meanwhile, added to restrictions on exports of advanced technologies to China.",
      "Rare earths have remained at the center of China-U.S. talks aimed at staving off huge tariff increases that were postponed in May to allow time for negotiations on a broader trade agreement. The deadline for reaching a deal is Aug. 12.",
      "An agreement announced in late June did not remove China\u2019s permitting requirement on rare earths, but Beijing agreed to flexibility in dialing up or down the approval process as needed.",
      "Computer chips are another key bone of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Friday that it had taken note of a decision by the Trump administration to lift restrictions on exports of key semiconductors used in artificial intelligence made by Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices.",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China \u2014 as well as MI308 chips from AMD.",
      "But Commerce Ministry spokesman Wang Wentao said restoring healthy trade ties will require more action by Washington.",
      "U.S. export controls on Ascend chips made by Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies have hurt the interests of Chinese companies, Wang told reporters in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and correct their wrong practices through equal consultation, create a good environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between enterprises of both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor production and supply chain,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "For 37 years in a searing California desert, runners from across the globe have embarked on a 135-mile race through one of the hottest places on Earth",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",
      "\u201cI'm just out there longer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut still getting it done.\u201d",
      "Tony Wolf, kinesiology professor at the University of Georgia, said aging adults generally have reduced heart function compared to younger adults. When combined with the cardiovascular demand of exercise and heat stress, it can cause difficulties.",
      "There isn\u2019t much research about how the bodies of fit older adults, including competitive athletes, regulate internal temperature. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a ton of people in their 60s and older who are doing those kinds of events,\u201d said Wolf.",
      "Studies focused on adults before and after a training program found that exercise improved heart function and thermoregulation. That could suggest that the heart and thermoregulation impairments linked to aging are largely mitigated by lifelong fitness, Wolf said.",
      "The runners are spread out now, their flashing lights twinkling in the distance. This night is the toughest for Westergaard as sleep deprivation sets in. He zigzags on the road, barely awake. The runners ahead of him look like they're running toward him.",
      "In past years, his hallucinations have included people luring him to rest on couches that were actually bushes. Another time, he struck up a conversation with a kid skateboarding by him with a dog. And once, he watched for hours as a guy swung off the edge of the crescent moon, waving down at him.",
      "\u201cIt was just clear as day,\u201d Westergaard said of the hallucination.",
      "At 3:10 a.m. at mile 98 (157.72 kilometers), he sleeps for 15 minutes under the moonlight.",
      "\u201cNo one really quite understands\u201d why he does this, said Madison.",
      "At 11:50 a.m. and around mile 123 (197.95 kilometers), Westergaard shuffles through the town of Lone Pine. Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S., soars some 14,500 feet (4,420 meters) into the blue sky.",
      "A crowd claps and cheers as he runs by.",
      "\u201cGo Danny, go!\u201d yelled a man.",
      "It's 92 F (33.33 C) as he approaches the final 4,750 foot (1,447.8 meters) mountain ascent to the finish line. Westergaard is walking at a snail's pace and says he\u2019s falling asleep. But his smile hasn\u2019t waned.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way,\u201d Westergaard said, Madison pacing behind and spraying him.",
      "\u201cLong way for a burger!\u201d she responded. They giggle while thinking about the veggie burger they'll buy upon finishing.",
      "Then he does, crossing the finish line with his crew at exactly 45 hours and 29 minutes.",
      "It was his most special Badwater 135 race by far, he says misty eyed, having Meagan and Madison at his side.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to host Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday at the White House, as the two countries are seeking closer security and economic ties in the face of shifting geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "Marcos, who met Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, is set to become the first Southeast Asian leader to hold talks with Trump in his second term.",
      "Marcos' three-day visit shows the importance of the alliance between the treaty partners at a time when China is increasingly assertive in the South China Sea, where Manila and Beijing have clashed over the hotly contested Scarborough Shoal.",
      "Washington sees Beijing, the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, as its biggest competitor, and consecutive presidential administrations have sought to shift U.S. military and economic focus to the Asia-Pacific in a bid to counter China. Trump, like others before him, has been distracted by efforts to broker peace in a range of conflicts, from Ukraine to Gaza.",
      "Tariffs also are expected to be on the agenda. Trump has threatened to impose 20% tariffs on Filipino goods on Aug. 1 unless the two sides can strike a deal.",
      "\"I intend to convey to President Trump and his Cabinet officials that the Philippines is ready to negotiate a bilateral trade deal that will ensure strong, mutually beneficial and future-oriented collaborations that only the United States and the Philippines will be able to take advantage of,\u201d Marcos said Sunday when he was departing for Washington, according to his office.",
      "Manila is open to offering zero tariffs on some U.S. goods to strike a deal with Trump, finance chief Ralph Recto told local journalists.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hinted that a trade agreement with the Philippines was in the works. \u201cPerhaps this will be a topic of discussion,\u201d she told reporters Monday when asked about tariff negotiations.",

      "\u201cOur storied alliance has never been stronger or more essential than it is today, and together we remain committed to the mutual defense treaty,\u201d Hegseth said Monday. \u201cAnd this pact extends to armed attacks on our armed forces, aircraft or public vessels, including our Coast Guard anywhere in the Pacific, including the South China Sea.\u201d",

      "Federal records related to the investigation into the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. have been released",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Federal records related to the investigation into the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were released on Monday, following the disclosure in March of tens of thousands of documents about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "In January, President Donald Trump ordered the release of thousands of classified governmental documents about Kennedy's assassination, while also moving to declassify federal records related to the deaths of New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and King more than five decades ago.",
      "Trump ordered Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Attorney General Pam Bondi to coordinate with other government officials to review records related to the assassinations of RFK and King, and present a plan to the president for their \u201ccomplete release.\u201d Some 10,000 pages of records about the RFK assassination were released April 18.",
      "Justice Department attorneys later asked a federal judge to end a sealing order for the records nearly two years ahead of its expiration date. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King led, is opposed to unsealing any of the records for privacy reasons. The organization\u2019s lawyers said King\u2019s relatives also wanted to keep the files under seal.",
      "Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents to find new information about the civil rights leader's assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.",
      "The King family's statement released after Trump's order in January said they hoped to get an opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release. King\u2019s family, including his two living children, Martin III and Bernice, was given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure.",
      "In a statement released Monday, King's children called their father\u2019s case a \u201ccaptivating public curiosity for decades.\u201d But they also emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that \u201cthese files must be viewed within their full historical context.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family\u2019s continuing grief,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Here is what we know about the assassination and what scholars had to say ahead of the release of the documents.",
      "King was standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, heading to dinner with a few friends, when he was shot and killed.",
      "King had been in Memphis to support a sanitation workers strike protesting poor working conditions and low pay. The night before the assassination, King delivered the famous \u201cMountaintop\u201d speech on a stormy night at the Mason Temple in Memphis.",
      "An earlier march on Beale Street had turned violent, and King had returned to Memphis to lead another march as an expression of nonviolent protest. King also had been planning the Poor People's Campaign to speak out against economic injustice.",
      "After a long manhunt, James Earl Ray was captured in London, and he pleaded guilty to assassinating King. He later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.",
      "FBI documents released over the years show how the bureau wiretapped King\u2019s telephone lines, bugged his hotel rooms and used informants to get information against him.",
      "\u201cHe was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign,\u201d the King family statement said.",
      "Members of King's family, and others, have questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, asked for the probe to be reopened, and in 1998, then-Attorney General Janet Reno directed the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department to do so.",
      "The Justice Department said it \u201cfound nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr. King.\u201d",
      "Dexter King, one of King's children, met with Ray in prison in 1997, saying afterwards that he believed Ray's claims of innocence. Dexter King died in 2024.",
      "With the support of King's family, a civil trial in state court was held in Memphis in 1999 against Loyd Jowers, a man alleged to have known about a conspiracy to assassinate King. Dozens of witnesses testified, and a Memphis jury found Jowers and unnamed others, including government agencies, participated in a conspiracy to assassinate King.",
      "It's not clear what the records will actually show.",
      "King scholars, for example, would like to see what information the FBI was discussing and circulating as part of their investigation, said Ryan Jones, director of history, interpretation and curatorial services at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis.",
      "\u201cThat's critical given the fact the American public, at that time, was unaware that the FBI that is involved in the investigation, was leading a smear campaign to discredit the same man while he was alive,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey were the same bureau who was receiving notices of assassination attempts against King and ignored them.\u201d",
      "Academics who have studied King also would like to see information about the FBI's surveillance of King, including the extent they went to get details about his personal life, track him, and try to discredit him as anti-American, said Lerone A. Martin, director of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University.",
      "However, Martin said he does not expect that the documents will have a \u201csmoking gun that will finally say, \u2018See, this is 100% evidence that the FBI was involved in this assassination.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to view these documents with an eye of suspicion because of the extent the FBI was willing to go to, to try to discredit him,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Trump's order about the records release said it is in the \u201cnational interest\u201d to release the records.",
      "\u201cTheir families and the American people deserve transparency and truth,\u201d the order said.",
      "However, the timing has led to skepticism from some observers.",
      "Jones questioned why the American public had not been able to see these documents much earlier.",
      "\u201cWhy were they sealed on the basis of national security, if the assassin was in prison outside of Nashville?\u201d he said.",
      "Jones said there are scholars who think the records release is a \u201cPR stunt\u201d by a presidential administration that is \u201crewriting, omitting the advances of some people that are tied to people of color, or diversity.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon has faced questions from lawmakers and citizens over the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from Defense Department websites and social media pages after it purged online content that promoted women or minorities. In response, the department restored some of those posts.",
      "Martin said Trump's motivation could be part of an effort to shed doubt on government institutions.",
      "\u201cIt could be an opportunity for the Trump administration to say, \u2018See, the FBI is evil, I've been trying to tell you this. This is why I've put (FBI director) Kash Patel in office because he's cleaning out the Deep State,'\u201d Martin said.",
      "Another factor could be the two attempts on Trump's life as he was campaigning for a second presidential term, and a desire to \u201cexpose the broader history of U.S. assassinations,\u201d said Brian Kwoba, an associate history professor at the University of Memphis.",
      "\u201cThat said, it is still a little bit confusing because it's not clear why any U.S. president, including Trump, would want to open up files that could be damaging to the United States and its image both in the U.S. and abroad,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "San Francisco is set to ban homeless people from living in RVs with a new citywide parking limit of two hours on large vehicles",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco is set to ban homeless people from living in RVs by adopting strict new parking limits the mayor says are necessary to keep sidewalks clear and prevent trash build-up.",
      "The policy, up for final approval by San Francisco supervisors Tuesday, targets at least 400 recreational vehicles in the city of 800,000 people. The RVs serve as shelter for people who can't afford housing, including immigrant families with kids.",
      "Those who live in them say they're a necessary option in an expensive city where affordable apartments are impossible to find. But Mayor Daniel Lurie and other supporters of the policy say motor homes are not suitable for long-term living and the city has a duty to both provide shelter to those in need and clean up the streets.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely want to serve those families, those who are in crisis across San Francisco,\u201d said Kunal Modi, who advises the mayor on health, homelessness and family services. \u201cWe feel the responsibility to help them get to a stable solution. And at the same time, we want to make sure that that stability is somewhere indoors and not exposed in the public roadway.\u201d",
      "Critics of the plan, however, say that it's cruel to force people to give up their only home in exchange for a shot at traditional housing when there is not nearly enough units for all the people who need help; the mayor is only offering additional money to help 65 households.",
      "Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, says city officials are woefully behind on establishing details of an accompanying permit program, which will exempt RV residents from parking limits so long as they are working with homeless outreach staff to find housing.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s going to be people who lose their RVs. I think there\u2019s going to be people who are able to get into shelter, but at the expense\" of people with higher needs, like those sleeping on a sidewalk, she said.",
      "San Francisco, like other U.S. cities, has seen an explosion in recent years of people living out of vehicles and RVs as the cost of living has risen. Banning oversized vehicles is part of Lurie's pledge to clean up San Francisco streets, and part of a growing trend to require homeless people to accept offers of shelter or risk arrest or tows.",
      "The proposal sets a two-hour parking limit citywide for all RVs and oversized vehicles longer than 22 feet (7 meters) or higher than 7 feet (2 meters), regardless of whether they are being used as housing.",
      "Under the accompanying permit program, RV residents registered with the city as of May are exempt from the parking limits. In exchange, they must accept the city's offer of temporary or longer-term housing, and get rid of their RV when it's time to move. The city has budgeted more than half a million dollars to buy RVs from residents at $175 per foot.",
      "The permits will last for six months. People in RVs who arrive after May will not be eligible for the permit program and must abide by the two-hour rule, which makes it impossible for a family in an RV to live within city limits.",
      "It first cleared the Board of Supervisors last week with two of 11 supervisors voting \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Carlos Perez, 55, was among RV residents who told supervisors at a hearing this month that they could not afford the city's high rents. Perez works full-time as a produce deliveryman and supports his brother, who lives with him and is unable to work due to a disability.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t do nothing wrong. We try to keep this street clean,\u201d he said, as he showed his RV recently to an Associated Press journalist. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be in a place like this.\u201d",
      "Yet, Perez also loves where he lives. The green-colored RV is decorated with a homey houseplant and has a sink and a tiny stove on which Carlos simmered a bean soup on a recent afternoon.",
      "He's lived in San Francisco for more than 30 years, roughly a decade of which has been in the RV in the working-class Bayview neighborhood. He can walk to work and it is close to the hospital where his brother receives dialysis multiple times a week.",
      "Zach, another RV resident who requested being identified by his first name to not jeopardize his ability to get work, started living in the vehicle a dozen years ago after realizing that no matter how hard he worked, he still struggled to pay rent.",
      "Now he works as a ride-hail driver and pursues his love of photography. He parks near Lake Merced in the city near the Pacific Ocean and pays $35 every two to four weeks to properly dispose of waste and fill the vehicle with fresh water.",
      "He says Lurie's plan is short-sighted. There is not enough housing available and many prefer to live in an RV over staying at a shelter, which may have restrictive rules. For Zach, who is able-bodied, maintains a clean space and has no dependents, moving to a shelter would be a step down, he says. Still, he expects to receive a permit.",
      "\u201cIf housing were affordable, there is a very good chance I wouldn\u2019t be out here,\u201d he said.",
      "RV dwellers say San Francisco should open a safe parking lot where residents could empty trash and access electricity. But city officials shuttered an RV lot in April, saying it cost about $4 million a year to service three dozen large vehicles and it failed to transition people to more stable housing.",
      "The mayor's new proposal comes with more money for beefed-up RV parking enforcement \u2014 but also an additional $11 million, largely for a small number of households to move to subsidized housing for a few years.",
      "Officials acknowledge that may not be sufficient to house all RV dwellers, but notes that the city also has hotel vouchers and other housing subsidies.",
      "Erica Kisch, CEO of nonprofit Compass Family Services, which assists homeless families, says they do not support the punitive nature of the proposal but are grateful for the extra resources.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s recognition that households should not be living in vehicles, that we need to do better for families, and for seniors and for anyone else who's living in a vehicle,\" she said. \u201cSan Francisco can do better, certainly.\u201d",

      "Two weeks after deadly floods swept through Texas, officials dropped the number of still-missing people in the hardest-hit area to three \u2014 down from nearly 160 in the days following the July Fourth weekend floods",
      "DALLAS -- Texas officials labored to account for more than 160 people originally reported missing along the Guadalupe River after the deadly July Fourth floods before ultimately concluding that most were safe and only three individuals still haven't been found, the top executive in the hardest-hit county said Monday.",
      "\u201cMost of them were tourists that came into town and left and went back home and didn\u2019t report that they were there,\u201d Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a special meeting of the county commissioner court. He called the process a \u201cHerculean effort.\"",
      "The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, and most of the deaths were in Kerr County, where destructive, fast-moving water rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away buildings and vehicles in the area about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio.",
      "The sharp revision in the number of missing by Kerr County officials on Saturday followed a familiar pattern in the often chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters. Hundreds of people were reported missing in the initial days after the floods through a phone hotline and email address, which launched investigators on an \u201cexhaustive effort\u201d to verify the status of each of those individuals, Kerrville police spokesperson Jonathan Lamb said.",
      "\u201cWe understand how critical it is to report this information accurately \u2014 not only for the families affected but for the integrity of our emergency response as a whole,\u201d Lamb said.",
      "Drastic changes in the missing count after a disaster aren\u2019t unusual.",
      "For instance, the death count from the 2023 Maui fire was eventually found to be just over 100 \u2014 far below the 1,100 initially feared missing.",
      "In 2017, a wildfire in Northern California\u2019s wine country killed more than 20 people, but most of the 100 people initially reported missing were located safe.",
      "The 2018 wildfire that largely destroyed the California town of Paradise ended up killing nearly 100 people, though Butte County investigators at one point had the names of more than 3,000 people who were not accounted for in the early days of the disaster. The names were whittled down when the list was published in the local paper, and many people realized for the first time that officials were looking for them.",
      "Texas\u2019 Hill Country is a popular tourist destination, where campers seek out spots along the Guadalupe River amid the rolling landscapes.",
      "Vacation cabins, RV parks and youth campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, including Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls where at least 27 campers and counselors died in the floods.",
      "The flooding was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, experts said, and it moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in Kerr County, which lacked a warning system.",
      "At a July 14 news conference, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had lowered the number of still-missing in the state to about 100 and suggested that pinning down that number was difficult. In the days after the floods, officials had put the number of missing at about 170 statewide with all but about 10 coming from Kerr County alone.",
      "Campers, residents or people who registered at RV parks or hotels are easier to account for, Abbott said. Others may have been reported missing by a friend, family member or coworker.",
      "In Travis County, which includes Austin, the floods killed at least 10 people. The sheriff\u2019s office has said one person remains on their missing list but may be removed if they can verify sightings of the person.",
      "Kristen Dark, a spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s office, said investigators work the missing person and decedent list \u201cjust like we would work any other cases.\u201d For instance, if someone reports that they haven\u2019t seen their neighbor, deputies might begin by reaching out to the neighbor\u2019s employer and family.",
      "\u201cThey use all kinds of different avenues to see if they can find out either that the person hasn\u2019t been seen or that the person is alive and here\u2019s where they are,\u201d she said.",

      "After the vehicles were torched, Mayor Eric Adams suggested the suspect was connected to protests in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere over the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda.",
      "\u201cSetting police vehicles ablaze is not a form of protest \u2014 it is a federal crime,\u201d Joseph Nocella Jr., U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a news release Monday.",

      "A New York horse carriage driver has been acquitted of animal cruelty",
      "NEW YORK -- A horse carriage driver was acquitted Monday of animal cruelty in a modern trial about the old-fashioned coaches that meander through New York's Central Park.",
      "A six-person jury found Ian McKeever not guilty of overworking a horse called Ryder, who collapsed en route back to his stable on an 84-degree Fahrenheit (29-degree Celsius) day in August 2022. The horse lay on an avenue near Times Square for nearly an hour as concerned bystanders gathered around and police cooled him with a hose and ice. The animal ultimately got up, to cheers.",
      "McKeever had pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charge. His attorney, Raymond Loving, said the horse wasn't overtaxed and simply tripped while changing lanes on a Manhattan street.",
      "\u201cThe verdict was very gratifying. This has been an ordeal for him,\u201d Loving said by phone, adding that \u201cthe evidence just didn\u2019t support the charge.\u201d",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement that prosecutors presented \u201ca thorough case based on the facts and evidence.\u201d",
      "Featured in countless movies and TV shows, New York's horse carriages are popular with visitors and people celebrating special occasions. But animal rights advocates have long tried to get the coaches banned, and the issue became a prominent, celebrity-studded local political debate for a time about a decade ago.",
      "Anti-coach activists question the horses' treatment and contend that Manhattan streets are no place for equines, pointing to some collisions and collapses over the years. Enthusiasts say the carriages are a time-honored tourist draw that employs several hundred drivers and creates a role for surplus farm and race horses that might otherwise be slaughtered.",
      "McKeever, an Irish immigrant, has been a carriage driver for decades. His brother owned Ryder.",
      "A horse-carriage-industry veterinarian, Dr. Camilo Sierra, told jurors he estimated Ryder's age at 28 to 30, eventually settling on 26 \u2014 the maximum age at which carriage-pullers can legally work. Police Sgt. Vincent Fontana testified that McKeever told him the horse was 13.",
      "Ryder was outside for over seven hours on Aug. 10, 2022, mostly in Central Park, taking passengers on two trips over the course of the day.",
      "Passerby Caroline Londahl-Smidt testified that she worried after noticing his prominent ribs and seeing him seem to struggle up a hill, with McKeever shaking the reins in an apparent effort to hurry the horse along.",
      "Prosecutor Sophie Robart argued that McKeever \u201cpushed Ryder beyond his limits\u201d until the horse's body gave out.",
      "After Ryder left the park and collapsed, bystander video published by the New York Post showed McKeever snapping the reins at him and telling him to get up.",
      "McKeever's lawyer maintained that Ryder wasn't overheated or mistreated, and that the driver acted responsibly. McKeever, 56, testified that he strove to get the animal to stand because prolonged reclining can cause health problems for equines.",
      "Ryder\u2019s temperature was normal and his breathing rate was slightly elevated when Fontana measured it, after the horse had been hosed down for some time. Later that evening at the stable, Sierra found Ryder alert, with normal vital signs, but he noted the underweight horse walked weakly. The veterinarian said he believed the animal had a neurological problem.",
      "Two months after the collapse, an ailing Ryder was euthanized. A necropsy showed he had bone cancer.",
      "Carriage drivers' union shop steward Christina Hansen said Monday that the union has since taken steps, including improving access to a horse hospital. Drivers \"enter this line of work because we love animals,\u201d she said.",
      "Animal rights activists, meanwhile, continued to inveigh against the industry. Edita Birnkrant, who runs an anti-horse-carriage group called NYCLASS, called the verdict \u201cheartbreaking\" and renewed a call for the city to stop issuing new carriage driver licenses.",
      "Another Manhattan carriage driver was charged with animal cruelty in 2013 after authorities said he kept a horse working for days with an injured hoof. That driver pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, a noncriminal violation, and was sentenced to community service, according to news reports. Court records of his case are sealed.",

      "Divers, boats, drones and dogs were deployed Monday as part of search and rescue operations on the river, said Jason Carr, spokesperson for the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office.

      "Detectives were working to determine how the group was swept over the falls and how those rescued were able to survive.",
      "\u201cThe presumption is that the three to survive did not go through the falls because the chances of them living through that are almost slim to none,\u201d Carr said.",
      "The group was floating down the river but the type of flotation devices they were using have not been confirmed, Carr said.",
      "People recreating on that area of the river normally exit at the Dillon Falls day use area, as the waterfall is just around the bend, Carr said. Signs along the river warn of the hazardous waterfall ahead.",
      "The three people rescued had minor wounds such as scrapes and bruises and were able to get out of the rescue boat on their own and walk. They were transported to a local hospital to ensure they had no other injuries, Carr said.",
      "Officials have yet to release the identities of those in the group.",

      "The filing comes less than a week after the ex-commissioner, Thomas Donlon, sued Adams and his top deputies, accusing them of operating the department as a criminal racket that rewarded unqualified loyalists and punished whistleblowers. Donlon said he was sidelined for trying to clean up the corruption.",
      "After that lawsuit was filed, Adams privately told members of a nonprofit business advocacy group at a meeting that he'd fired Donlon, 71, from his brief stint as commissioner last fall because he was \u201crapidly deteriorating mentally,\" according to attendees. Donlon cited news reports about those comments in his legal claim.",
      "The department\u2019s former top spokesperson, Tarik Sheppard, who was also named in Donlon\u2019s lawsuit, told reporters that his former boss was \u201cgoing through some cognitive issues\u201d and believed \u201cthere was this conspiracy against him.\u201d",
      "Their comments amounted to a defamatory \u201cpublic character assassination\" intended to \"weaponize mental health to silence a whistleblower,\u201d Donlon's attorney, John Scola, said Monday.",
      "Donlon, a former FBI official, was appointed by Adams in September to lead a department reeling from overlapping federal investigations and high-level resignations.",
      "He was replaced by the current commissioner, Jessica Tisch, in November. During his short tenure, federal authorities searched Donlon's home for decades-old documents that he said were unrelated to his work at the department. He has not been publicly accused of wrongdoing in connection with that search.",
      "In his short time as commissioner, Donlon said he uncovered \u201csystemic corruption\u201d by members of the mayor\u2019s inner circle, including a scheme to reward unqualified loyalists with lucrative promotions in exchange for political favors.",
      "In his lawsuit, Donlon accused Sheppard of misappropriating the commissioner's rubber stamp signature to give himself a raise, then threatening to kill Donlon when confronted about it.",
      "Sheppard, who left the department in May, has denied that allegation. Inquiries to City Hall about the defamation claim were not immediately returned.",

      "Rachel Ganz's husband might be alive. But he might not be. More than three months after he was last seen near the Eleven Point River in Missouri amid severe flooding and evacuation orders, Jon Ganz is just ... missing.",
      "That leaves Rachel, 45, in a limbo of sorrow and frustration, awakening \u201cevery morning to a reality I don't want to exist in.\u201d She dwells there in a liminal state, she wrote by email July 11, with a stream of questions running through her head: \u201cIs he trapped by debris in the river? Is he in a tangled mass of debris on the riverbank? Did he wander off into the forested area instead?\u201d And one that remains stubbornly unanswered: \u201cAre they ever going to find him?\u201d",

      "Like the families of the missing after the July 4 Texas floods experienced for much of this month, Ganz is suffering from what grief experts call ambiguous loss: the agony of living in the absence of a loved one whose fate is uncertain. Humans across borders, cultures and time unfortunately know it well. Ambiguous loss can be intimate, like Ganz' experience, or global, as in the cases of the missing from the Sept. 11 attacks, tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and Japan, the Turkey-Syria earthquake, the Israel-Hamas war and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The distinguishing feature, according to Pauline Boss, the researcher who coined the term in the 1970s, is the absence of ritual \u2014 a wake, a funeral, throwing dirt on a grave \u2014 to help the families left behind accept the loss. The only way forward, experts say, is learning to live with the uncertainty \u2014 a concept not well-tolerated in Western cultures.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a state of mind, a state of the nation, right now where you either win or you lose, it\u2019s either black or its white,\u201d said Boss, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota who has researched ambiguous loss globally over a half century. \u201cYou have to let go of the binary to get past it, and some never do. They are frozen. They are stuck.\u201d",
      "Sarah Wayland, a social work professor from Central Queensland University in Sydney, says ambiguous loss is different from mourning because it's about \u201crepetitive trauma exposure,\u201d from the 24-hour news cycle and social media. Then there is a devastating quiet that descends on the people left behind when interest has moved on to something else.",
      "\u201cThey might be living in this space of dreading but also hoping at the same time,\" Wayland said. \"And they are experiencing this loss both publicly and privately.\u201d",
      "Heavy rains drove a wall of water through Texas Hill Country in the middle of the night July 4 , killing at least 132 people and leaving nearly 200 missing as of last week, though that number has dwindled as this week begins. Over just two hours, the Guadalupe River at Comfort, Texas, rose from hip-height to three stories tall, sending water weighing as much as the Empire State building downstream roughly every minute it remained at its crest.",
      "Those without bodies to bury have been frozen in a specific state of numbness and horror \u2014 and uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond human imagination to believe that a loved one is dead,\u201d Boss says.",
      "This feeling can come in any global circumstance. Lidiia Rudenko, 39, represents a group of families in Ukraine whose relatives are missing in action. Her husband, Sergey, 41, has been missing since June 24, 2024, when his marine brigade battled the Russian army near Krynky. He's one of tens of thousands of Ukrainians missing since the Russian invasion in 2022. And she is one of thousands in Ukraine left behind.",
      "\u201cSome people fall into grief and can no longer do anything, neither act nor think, while others start to act as quickly as possible and take the situation into their own hands, as I did,\u201d Rudenko said. \u201cThere are days when you can\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we call it \u201cgetting sick. And we allow ourselves to get sick a little, cry it out, live through it, and fight again.\u201d",
      "For nearly a decade, Leah Goldin was part of a very small number of people in Israel with the dubious distinction of being the family of of a hostage.",
      "Her son, Hadar Goldin, 23, a second lieutenant in the Israeli army, was killed, then his body taken on August 1, 2014. A blood-soaked shirt, prayer fringes and other evidence found in the tunnel where Goldin's body had been held led the Israeli army to determine he'd been killed, she said. His body has never been returned.",
      "Her family\u2019s journey didn\u2019t dovetail with the regular oscillations of grief. They held what Leah Goldin now calls a \u201cpseudo-funeral' including Goldin's shirt and fringes, at the urging of Israel\u2019s military rabbis. But the lingering uncertainty was like a \u201cknife constantly making new cuts.\".",
      "In the dizzying days after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Goldin family threw themselves into attempting to help hundreds of families of the 251 people Hamas had dragged into Gaza. But for a time, the Goldins found themselves shunned as advocacy for the Oct. 7 hostages surged.",
      "\u201cWe were a symbol of failure,\u201d Leah Goldin said. \u201cPeople said, \u2018We aren\u2019t like you. Our kids will come back soon.\u2019\u201d She understood their fear, but Goldin, who had spent a decade pushing for Hamas to release her son\u2019s body, was devastated by the implication. In time, the hostage families brought her more into the fold, learning from her experience.",
      "Hamas still holds 50 Israeli hostages, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive. In Gaza, Israel\u2019s offensive has killed nearly 59,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t say how many militants have been killed but says over half of the dead have been women and children. Thousands of the dead are believed to be buried under rubble throughout the enclave.",
      "Ganz, whose husband went missing in Missouri in April, said the sheriff's department and others searched far and wide at first. She posted fliers around the town where his car was found, and on social media. Then someone accused her of \u201cgrieving without proof,\" a remark that still makes her fume.",
      "\u201cOne of my biggest frustrations has been people stating, \u2018If you need anything, please let me know,\u2019\u201d Ganz said. That puts the burden on her, and follow-through has been hard to come by, she said. \u201cWe already have enough ambiguity.\"",
      "She's thinking about setting up a nonprofit organization in Jon's honor, dedicated to breaking the stigma against men getting therapy, to show \u201cthat it's not weak.\u201d That tracks with Goldin's thinking that taking action can help resolve loss \u2014 and with Rudenko's experience in Ukraine.",
      "Boss recommends separate community meetings for families of the confirmed dead and those of the missing. For the latter, a specific acknowledgement is helpful: \u201cYou have to first say to the people, \u2018What you are experiencing is an ambiguous loss. It\u2019s one of the most difficult kinds of losses there is because there\u2019s no resolution. It\u2019s not your fault,\u2019\u201d Boss said.",
      "In Ukraine, Rudenko said it helps to recognize that families of the missing and everyone else live in \u201ctwo different worlds.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t need words, because people who have not been affected by ambiguous loss will never find the right words,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we just need to be hugged and left in silence.\u201d",

      "The driver, identified by police as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, was attacked by bystanders after the crash early Saturday in east Hollywood and paramedics later found that he had been shot.

      "Actor and director Malcolm-Jamal Warner, best known for his role on \"The Cosby Show,\" has died in an accidental drowning in Costa Rica, officials there said. He was 54.",
      "Warner drowned Sunday afternoon at a beach in Cocles de Lim\u00f3n on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast, the country's Judicial Investigation Department said. He appeared to be pulled out to sea by a current.",
      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "Two adult men were treated on site. One was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition, the Costa Rican Red Cross said. They tried to resuscitate the other man, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. The Costa Rican Red Cross didn't provide an update on the man transferred to a local clinic.",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America.\"",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",

    "summary": "He opened such popular NYC institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led to a suicide attempt two years later. He has now penned an irreverent memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\"",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Keith McNally hates New Year's Eve \u2013 he doesn't like being told to have a good time. \"I don't like to be forced to enjoy myself,\" he said.",
      "The \"least hospitable man in hospitality,\" as he calls himself, is not a big smiler, either. \"Inside,\" he explained.",
      "It doesn't seem to have hurt. Over 40 years, he's opened some of New York City's most popular restaurants, among them The Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis \u2013 institutions almost as well-known as some of the bold-face names that frequent them. But McNally himself has never been much of a publicity hound, even less so after suffering a stroke in 2016. \"Naturally I'm a bit embarrassed to be on TV talking like this\u2014who wouldn't be?\" he said. \"But it's good for me to do it, because it gets me free of my embarrassment. Actually, I'm embarrassed talking about embarrassment!\"",
      "But the British-born McNally has largely overcome his embarrassment in a new memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\" \u00a0\"The drawback for me with most memoirs [is], if you're not embarrassed by what you write, you've probably not spoken the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't cringe over every word, it's not the truth.\"",
      "The hardest part to write, he said, was about his suicide attempt, \"because my kids. I didn't want to leave them at all.\"",
      "That suicide attempt was two years after his stroke. He was found by his younger son, George. \"He was supposed to not find me,\" McNally said. \"Like most teenagers he would sleep until noon. But that day he woke up early, at 8:00 o'clock.\"",
      "\"You expected him to be sleeping later, he woke up early, he saw you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, the bastard just woke up early and saved my life!\" he laughed.",
      "McNally might joke about it now, but the father of five was suffering with an immobile right arm (he was right-handed), back pain, and aphasia (which causes his slurred speech), and his second marriage was falling apart. But as he writes, some sobering words from a doctor made him reflect: \"He said that children who lose a parent to suicide were far more likely to kill themselves than the children of parents who don't. That stopped me in my tracks.\"",
      "Because he had such trouble communicating verbally after his stroke, McNally began using social media. \"I was so embarrassed by my speech and the way I looked, I didn't go to my restaurants for one year,\" he said. \"I was ashamed. But eventually I realized, nothing to be ashamed about. So, not only did I admit it wasn't a bad thing, but I went in on Instagram.\"",
      "McNally went viral in 2022 with a post criticizing former late-night host James Corden for allegedly being rude to the waitstaff at Balthazar. But now, McNally confesses in his book he isn't so sure calling out Corden was fair. He wrote: \"For someone who's hyperconscious of humiliation since suffering a stroke, it now seems monstrous that I didn't consider the humiliation I was subjecting Corden to. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot of a slot machine and thousands of gold coins were spilling out in front of me. That night I ended up with over 90,000 followers. I was intoxicated with self-righteousness.\"",
      "\"Uh-huh, it's true,\" McNally said. \"But afterwards, I felt really bad.\"",
      "Corden later apologized. But the 73-year-old McNally has continued creating a stir online. Take this recent post he wrote about his friend, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, describing a weeklong affair the two had in the 1970s. The story made news \u2026 except that it was completely made up.",
      "I said, \"Some people say, 'Listen, Keith, you know, it's really not cool for you to be sharing this.' And so, did you enjoy that back-and-forth with them?\"",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid, I did, yeah,\" he laughed.",
      "\"And I wonder, do you think that the stroke \u2013 I don't know, is that, does that \u2026\"",
      "\"Say what you think,\" said McNally.",
      "\"Well, is it that you feel a little trapped inside of yourself?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"I've always been a little like this inside. But since my stroke, and now on the outside.\"",
      "McNally grew up in the East End of London, one of four children born to Jack, a dockworker, and Joyce, a house and office cleaner. The family had little money. \"I got angry inside at my parents,\" he said, \"because we had no books in the house, no pictures on the walls. But they couldn't help it. They were working class who grew up with nothing.\"",
      "McNally says he didn't eat in a restaurant until he was 17. \"Most of the time, when we were on a holiday, we would go to the restaurant, they would look the prices outside, and then she'd go, 'Not for us.'\"",
      "And yet, when McNally moved to New York City in 1975 as an aspiring filmmaker, he made ends meet by working in restaurants. \"I didn't eat asparagus until I came here,\" he said. \"And the next day, I went to the doctor because the smell of my \u2026\"",
      "\"That was so pungent from eating the asparagus?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I thought I was sick! So, I went to the doctor. He said, 'What'd you eat last night?'\" McNally laughed.",
      "\"You know what? You gotta put that in the paperback,\" I said.",
      "In 1980, McNally opened his own restaurant, The Odeon, in the neighborhood of Tribeca, in what had been a no-man's land. An immediate sensation, it established certain McNally \"musts,\" such as the importance of having a hamburger on the menu. \"I don't like hamburgers much myself,\" he said. \"But it's a sign of snobbery not to have a hamburgers.\"",
      "McNally prides himself on putting his staff above even his diners. Some of his employees have been with him for over 30 years. And ever since returning to work post-stroke, McNally has come to appreciate how they feel about him. \"I had to talk to my staff and was really nervous,\" he said. \"They were really kind. In the end, kindness is really essential.\"",
      "I asked, \"The stroke lifted the veil on what they thought of you?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah,\" McNally laughed. \"They made me feel good.\"",

      "There was a time when everything worked. ...\u00a0 I'd been happily married and the owner of eight successful Manhattan restaurants, including Balthazar in SoHo. In 2004, the New York Times had called me \"The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.\" I had everything going for me. And then on November 26, 2016, the clock stopped.",
      "I was living in London. One Saturday morning I coaxed my youngest children, George and Alice, into seeing a Caravaggio exhibition with me at the National Gallery. George was thirteen, Alice eleven. While looking at a painting of Jesus being betrayed by Judas, The Taking of Christ, I sensed my body beginning to show signs of betraying me: a strange metallic tingling started to pinch my fingertips. It was an odd feeling, but as it stopped after five or six seconds, I didn't give it another thought. Soon afterward, to the relief of my children, we left the museum.",
      "Two hours later, when I was back home by myself, the metallic feeling returned. Only this time it was in earnest. Within seconds the horrific tingling shot up my left arm and, like some malignant jellyfish, clasped itself onto my face. Terrified, I phoned Alina, who rushed back with the kids and instantly called an ambulance. George, fists clenched, was panic-stricken as medics examined my convulsing body. Within minutes I was being hoisted into the waiting ambulance. Alina, George and Alice looked on.",
      "I woke up several hours later in Charing Cross Hospital. The first thing the doctor told me was that I'd had a stroke. The second thing was that my brain would never be the same again. Perhaps his bluntness was necessary for legal reasons, but from where I stood\u2014or lay\u2014it was a brutal awakening.",
      "After the doctor left, I tried wriggling my arms and legs to check that I wasn't paralyzed. I wasn't, thank God. To test my memory, I wrote the alphabet on the back of the nurse's chart. I then tried saying the letters aloud, but here there was a problem. The words wouldn't conform to my efforts. They exited my mouth in such a slurred and disorderly way that I sounded like a stage drunk. But this was a small price to pay for my stroke. My first stroke, that is. Because the next day the artillery arrived and gave me such a hammering that in one fell swoop I lost the use of my right hand, right arm and right leg. And my slurred speech, perhaps in fright, went AWOL. Overnight I was confined to a wheelchair and deprived of language.",
      "So much for The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.",
      "* * *",
      "I shared a ward with five other men whose ages ranged from forty to eighty. At night, with words inaccessible to me, I'd listen in awe to them talking. Speech suddenly seemed like a divine accomplishment. Even everyday words had an element of poetry to them.",
      "I dreaded the moment when the men would stop talking and I'd be left with my own thoughts. Sleepless, half-paralyzed and unable to speak, I felt buried alive. More than anything, I wished the stroke had killed me.",
      "Bereft of speech and right side unusable, I wondered how my relationship with Alina might change. And with George and Alice also. All children exaggerate their father's strength. Most sense it ebbing away imperceptibly over twenty or so years. Generally, a father's decline appears natural, tolerable even. It wasn't going to be like that for my children.",
      "My new life seemed ungraspable. It existed, but was outside of me.",
      "On my second day in the hospital, Alina arranged for George and Alice to visit. An hour before they were due, I became so ashamed of them seeing me disabled that I canceled the visit. The next day I could hold out no longer.",
      "Hospitals are a great leveler. Like soldiers at war, patients lose all distinctiveness. As they entered the ward, George and Alice failed to recognize me. I was lying at the end of a row of identical beds, assimilating into the world of the sick and dying. Although it had only been three days since I last saw them, they looked years younger. They stood by the door, small eyes darting from one sick man to the next, searching for some identifiable sign of their father. After a few seconds they rushed to my bed.",
      "Alice seemed happy to see me, but George looked angry and said less than usual. He'd behaved in a similar way a year earlier after watching me lose a match in a squash tournament. Back then, I found his anger confusing. Now it made sense.",
      "Alina put on a brave face but was so shell-shocked she said little. I managed to gurgle out a few words, and in between the long silences the heavy breathing of the man in the next bed entered uncomfortably into our space. Alina told the children I was going to regain my voice and would soon be walking out of the hospital.",
      "Neither responded.",
      "When the three of them left, I wept for the first time in twenty years.",

    "title": "Bridget Everett on how she ended up as \"Somebody Somewhere\"",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bridget-everett-on-how-she-ended-up-as-somebody-somewhere/",
    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:55:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The actress and cabaret star put her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, on the map with the award-winning HBO series about a Midwestern woman returning home and working through grief. She returned to Manhattan, to talk about her surreal journey.",
    "story": [
      "Bridget Everett will try to tell you she's not a celebrity in Manhattan, Kansas, but don't believe her. She did grow up here, one of six kids, so there's that. \"I just love that it still feels like small-town America,\" she said. \"I come back quite a bit and I visit the same spots.\"",
      "But it was when her HBO show \"Somebody Somewhere\" was set here in Manhattan, that Everett became a bon fide local legend.",
      "The show follows Sam Miller (played by Everett), who moves back to her hometown in her 40s, trying to figure out herself, and life, after the death of her sister. Everett was a writer, producer, and lead actor in the semi-autobiographical series. \"I was like, 'Is anybody going to watch this? This is not a cool show!'\" she said. \"You know, like, it's about friendship. I'm not a top model, you know? I don't want to speak for anybody else in the cast! But I think that's exactly kind of why it works.\"",
      "Unlike her character on the show, who returns home to Manhattan, Kansas, Everett stayed in Manhattan, New York, for years, working mostly as a waitress and using, believe or not, karaoke as her main creative outlet.",
      "\"My way of connecting with people is through singing,\" she said. \"It kind of always has been, and it's easier for me to unlock and kind of be who I really want to be when I'm singing.",
      "Those karaoke performances led to her own, now-legendary cabaret shows at the famed Joe's Pub in New York. Everett's performances are sort of unlike anything you've seen, and so risqu\u00e9 we can't show you much of it here on \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Everett said, \"What's interesting to me is, like, learning about people, and why am I up there with no bra and a low-cut thing with everything flying around? It's part of who I am, and I also kind of do it to understand myself, honestly. I like to talk about my family in this way because my family and I don't talk about it. I don't see a mental health care professional!\"",
      "And that's the amazing part: Everett's cabaret shows somehow end up being, in part anyway, a meditation on life and grief, including saying goodbye to her father, as well as the loss of her mother, sister, and her beloved dog, Poppy, whom she called the love of her life. \"For a while I felt a little bit of shame saying that, because romantic love is kind of what most people aspire to,\" Everett said. \"My life is driven in a different way. She just taught me how to love, and she just cracked my heart open in a way that, like, no other person could.\"",
      "In fact, it was this side of Everett that HBO and the show's creators wanted to highlight \u2013 the way we can feel both strong and broken, hopeless and hopeful, all in the same moment.",
      "Everett, who writes and performs multiple original songs on the show, says she got her love of music from her mother, Freddie. She also got her sense of humor from her mom, as well as her siblings, including Brock, Brian and Brad, who had given Bridget a piece of feedback: that her acting was improving. \"I was being honest,\" Brad said. \"Her acting, especially towards the end, I thought, was authentic. I even teared up on some of that, which is difficult to do when you know your sibling [is] acting. So, you need to separate who you know, and then see her in a character. And have it move you? I think it's a great compliment to her.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bridget. \"You could have just said that in a text.\"",
      "The HBO show features a number of Everett's actual friends and collaborators from New York, including Murray Hill, Mary Catherine Garrison, and, in a star turn, the just Emmy-nominated Jeff Hiller as her best friend, Joel.",
      "Though HBO chose not to renew \"Somebody Somewhere\" for a fourth season, it did win a prestigious Peabody Award, and also picked up an Emmy nomination this season for writing for a comedy series.",
      "Everett says the whole thing feels a little surreal: the journey from being somebody somewhere, to somebody who is right where she's supposed to be.",
      "\"Nothing will ever match this, and it couldn't, but that's okay,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't get the opportunity to have a TV show, to live a life beyond their wildest dreams. And then to get to do it with the people I love? It's why it's taken so long for me to move on and kind of let go. But now I'm just trying to celebrate that I got to do it at all.\"",

      "The summer when Sally Samuelson was eight, her brother Ellis graduated from high school and a few days later, he and his best friends, Heck Stevens and Ben Klosterman, drove up the coast in Heck's '64 Rambler American. They promised to be back in a week. Sally was the only one who went outside to see them off. She waved a dishrag and dabbed at pretend tears, then one or two real ones. \"Bye, little Pips!\" Ellis yelled from the back seat\u2014he called her Pipsqueak, with variations. \"See you in the funny papers!\"",
      "Ellis had thick, curly yellow hair long enough to tuck behind his ears and he wore a baseball cap to keep it there. He'd lately grown incredibly tall and skinny; his pants rode so low on his hip bones, they seemed about to slip off. Sally's sister, Katie, who was fourteen, called him El Greck after they saw El Greco's Christ on the Cross at the Getty; even their parents confirmed the resemblance.",
      "His last two years in high school, Ellis had a girlfriend named Carla, who was also tall and blond and liked to show off her stomach. In front of Ellis, she would say hi to Sally. Sometimes Ellis would come into Sally's room when she was drawing on the floor; he'd sit by her and talk about his last baseball game or his weird calculus teacher, and sometimes he'd wonder how much he liked Carla and if she was even nice. Sally somehow knew not to say what she thought. Anyway, Ellis spent most of his time playing ball with Ben and Heck. For their trip, they packed Heck's old Rambler with sleeping bags, the small smelly tent the Samuelson kids used on camping trips, and a cooler full of sodas. After ten days, when Ellis hadn't come back, Heck showed up at the Samuelsons' front door with the tent. Sally answered his knock.",
      "\"Ellis decided to stay away for a few more days,\" he said.",
      "\"Stay where?\" Sally's mother said from behind her.",
      "\"With some girl he met,\" said Heck. \"Not sure where, exactly.\"",
      "\"Well, where did they meet?\"",
      "\"On a beach around Santa Cruz.\"",
      "That was all her mother could get out of Heck. \"Some girl has snagged Ellis,\" she told Sally's father when he came home from work.",
      "\"Good for her,\" he said.",
      "\"How can you say that, Phil?\" her mother cried. \"El's such an innocent. What if she's trouble?\"",

      "\"What if he doesn't come back in time for his job?\"",
      "Ellis was supposed to be a counselor at the day camp he'd attended since first grade.",
      "\"Let's worry about that when the time comes,\" Sally's father said.",

      "Joan Liang's life in America began in Palo Alto, where she lived in the attic of a two-story home on Azalea Street. Joan did chores for the widow who owned the house in exchange for reduced rent; she never could have afforded such a nice neighborhood otherwise. She lived in that attic until she was married, and she was married for only six weeks before she stabbed her husband. Joan was twenty-five and had lived in the United States for two years. The year was 1977.",
      "Joan had not thought she would stab her husband. It had been an accident (sort of). Afterward she was disappointed that marriage had not turned out as she'd imagined. She had thought it would be wonderful. It had been, actually. Until it wasn't.",
      "Though later, Joan would wonder why she'd ever thought marriage would be so special. As a child in Taiwan, most of the married women Joan encountered were melancholy, if not outright miserable; throughout her childhood, Joan's own mother had on occasion risen from the kitchen table without warning to cry with showy force into her hands.",
      "\"You've ruined everything!\" Mei would shriek if any of the children came near, and so they soon learned to keep away, which only worsened Mei's despondency. At least every other Saturday, Joan's father, Wen-Bao, spent the night across town in Shilin, where he kept a two-bedroom apartment for his mistress. Joan's mother was haunted by the two bedrooms; it drove her nuts, Mei said, to think of so much empty space.",
      "\"Can you imagine,\" Mei would remark, legs crossed as she sat before her vanity, \"how much lust a man must carry inside, to furnish such a large place for one woman? When all six of us are crowded in the same square footage? Do you understand the scope of his betrayal?\" At this point Joan's brothers usually wandered off; they were bored by this conversation, which repeated itself every few months. Only Joan would remain at her mother's feet, where she watched Mei sit with perfect posture before her mirror and pluck white strands from her hairline.",
      "After moving to California, Joan established the routine of calling her parents every Sunday evening Taipei time, during which Wen-Bao, if he'd visited his mistress that weekend, would have already returned home. On these calls, Joan's parents performed the same interrogation: how her studies at Stanford were proceeding, if there was any chance to graduate early from her master's program so that she might begin to earn money. Money was key. Joan had three brothers, each of whom by various rights (older, male) should have been sent abroad before her. Two had been disqualified by their academics, whereas the top candidate, Alfred, had been surprised by \"issues\" (his girlfriend was pregnant), and so at the last minute Joan was sent instead.",

      "Sopping except for Bob Alexander. Bob was lanky and spry, a semi-affable curmudgeon. At sixty-eight, he was the oldest of the First Thingers and among the fittest, too, though on this morning he was only going through the motions. Preoccupying Bob was the anonymous note that had been placed under the windshield wiper of his Audi sometime the night before.",
      "It had been a decade since his nephew had disappeared, and things like this still happened on occasion. A lead to nowhere, a tip to nothing. A psychic in New Braunfels who'd experienced a vision. \"Sounds promising,\" Bob had told the detective who'd called with that gem. A few days before, a short article on the tenth anniversary of the disappearance had run in the Statesman, so of course the kooks and grifters were coming out of the woodwork now.",
      "No one had ever shown up at his house before, though, and it was this, combined with the note's puzzling content, which meant that as soon as Bob left the gym, he would take the folded paper, stowed in his glove compartment, to Austin Police headquarters, a time-suck in building form, where, if he had to guess, he'd rehash the story of his missing nephew, Nathaniel Rothstein, without coming any closer to finding him.",

    "summary": "Felix Baumgartner made global headlines in 2012 when he jumped from the stratosphere and parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

    "story": [
      "An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot indicted for trying to shut off a passenger jet's engines mid-flight in 2023 recalled the scary moment he slipped out of reality after eating \"magic mushrooms.\"",
      "Former airline captain Joseph Emerson said he takes full responsibility for the night in October 2023 that changed his life.",
      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",
      "\"I hope that there are lessons that we can learn from my experience. And that's kind of why I'm talking you today,\" Emerson said.",

      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180.",
      "\"As alleged, Christine Hunsicker defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars through document forgery, fabricated audits, and material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition,\" Clayton said in a statement on Friday. \"The promise of pre-IPO technology companies can be fertile ground for fraudsters who play on investor euphoria.\"",
      "The indictment\u00a0said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress.",
      "In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors \"have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,\" despite Hunsicker's efforts to be \"fully cooperative and transparent\" with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "\"There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,\" they said.",
      "Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees.",
      "According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf.",
      "She \"persisted in her scheme\" even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said.",
      "Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business \"40 under 40\" lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s \"Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs\" and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted.",
      "At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said.",
      "Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged.",
      "They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records.",
      "She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000.",
      "The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud.",
      "Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said.",
      "It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March.",
      "In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's \"fake financials\" supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called \"Clothing-as-a-Service.\"",
      "\"In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,\" the lawsuit said. \"Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.\"",
      "Before CaaStle, Hunsicker launched Gwynnie Bee, a subscription service renting everyday clothes to women sizes 10 to 32.",
      "\"We want it to be a place where managing a rotating wardrobe is actually the way the majority of people interact with clothing,\" Hunsicker told CBS News in 2016 when discussing the company.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Jul 2025 12:04:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Pumpkin Spice Latte will soon return to Starbucks' menus, marking the unofficial start of fall for fans of the autumn-inspired beverage.",
    "story": [
      "The official start of fall is still months away, but the season is just around the corner for Starbucks fans.",
      "The coffee chain's popular Pumpkin Spice Latte is set to return on Aug. 26, Starbucks announced Monday. Although that's a later release date than last year, the 2025 return of the PSL is still on the earlier side for the company, which traditionally had waited until September to bring back the seasonal drink, closer to the actual start of autumn, which falls on Sept. 22 this year.",
      "The popular menu item consists of espresso, milk, Pumpkin Spice Syrup and whipped cream, with pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top. The coffee chain started adding real pumpkin to the drink in 2015.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as Starbucks' new fall menu comes at a critical juncture for Starbucks, which is pulling all of the levers it can to lure customers back into its stores. After enjoying years of strong growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as new menu items are \"cultural touchstones that spark connection, nostalgia and excitement,\" said Starbucks global chief brand officer Tressie Leiberman in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The perennial debut of the Pumpkin Spice Latte may not be enough on its own to turn around the fate of Starbucks. But if past years are any indication, it's sure to be a crowd pleaser and revenue booster.",
      "What is on Starbucks' new 2025 fall menu?",
      "Starbucks said several other fall-inspired drinks will be returning to its menu, including the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai and the Pecan Crunch Oatmilk Latte.",
      "The chain is also adding a new fall drink, called the Pecan Cortado, with Leiberman describing it as combining \"fall flavors with our bold espresso.\" Starbucks is also adding a fall menu item, Italian Sausage Egg Bites.",
      "The rollout of the new fall menu comes amid CEO Brian Niccol's\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\" campaign, which he rolled out in September of last year to increase foot traffic in the chain's stores and revive sales.",
      "The rise of PSL",
      "Starbucks introduced the drink in 2003 after a months-long brainstorming session to create the company's first fall beverage. Led by Peter Dukes, who is credited as the father of the drink, the group's goal was to match the success of the peppermint mocha.",
      "Little did they know it would become their most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Since debuting over 20 years ago, the Pumpkin Spice Latte, also known by its initials PSL, has skyrocketed in popularity, with hundreds of millions of beverages sold.",
      "\"Nobody knew at the beginning what it would grow to be,\" Dukes\u00a0said in a story posted on the Starbucks website for the beverage's 20-year anniversary. \"Twenty years later, it's taken on a life of its own.\"",
      "Starbucks initially considered naming the drink the fall harvest latte, but changed it to the Pumpkin Spice Latte \"because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin,\" Dukes said in a Starbucks post.",
      "The Starbucks-induced pumpkin craze led Merriam-Webster to add the \"pumpkin spice\" to the dictionary in 2022. It also prompted other chains like Dunkin' and McDonald's to introduce their own pumpkin-inspired beverages in 2007 and 2013, respectively.",
      "Mentions of pumpkin spice on U.S. menus climbed nearly 34% from 2014 to 2024, according to Technomic, which tracks consumer and menu trends.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed the country's first major legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing \"the exciting new frontier\" for the technology.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 20:12:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers face both rising premiums and falling subsidies next year in Obamacare plans.",
    "story": [
      "Most of the 24 million people in Affordable Care Act health plans face a potential one-two punch next year \u2014 double-digit premium increases along with a sharp drop in the federal subsidies that most consumers depend on to buy the coverage, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Insurers want higher premiums to cover the usual culprits \u2014 rising medical and labor costs and usage \u2014 but are tacking on extra percentage point increases in their 2026 rate proposals to cover effects of policy changes advanced by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. One key factor built into their filings with state insurance departments: uncertainty over whether Congress allows more generous, COVID-era ACA tax subsidies to expire at the end of December.",
      "\"The out-of-pocket change for individuals will be immense, and many won't actually be able to make ends meet and pay premiums, so they will go uninsured,\" said JoAnn Volk, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "Especially if the higher subsidies expire, insurance premiums will be among the first financial pains felt by health care consumers after policy priorities put forward by President Trump and the GOP. Many other changes \u2014 such as additional paperwork requirements and spending cuts to Medicaid \u2014 won't occur for at least another year. But spiking ACA premiums, as the nation heads into key midterm elections, invites political pushback. Some on Capitol Hill are exploring ways to temper the subsidy reductions.",
      "\"I am hearing on both sides \u2014 more from Republicans, but from both the House and Senate\" \u2014 that they are looking for levers they can pull, said Pennsylvania-based insurance broker Joshua Brooker, who follows legislative actions as part of his job and sits on several insurance advisory groups.",
      "In initial filings, insurers nationally are seeking a median rate increase \u2014 meaning half of the proposed increases are lower and half higher \u2014 of 15%, according to an analysis for the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker covering 19 states and the District of Columbia. KFF is a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That's up sharply from the last few years. For the 2025 plan year, for example, KFF found that the median proposed increase was 7%.",
      "Health insurers \"are doing everything in their power to shield consumers from the rising costs of care and the uncertainty in the market driven by recent policy changes,\" wrote Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, the industry's lobbying group. The emailed response also called on lawmakers \"to take action to extend the health care tax credits to prevent skyrocketing cost increases for millions of Americans in 2026.\"",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to requests for comment.",
      "These are initial numbers and insurance commissioners in some states may alter requests before approval.",
      "Still, \"it's the biggest increase we've seen in over five years,\" said analysis co-author Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA.",
      "Premiums will vary based on where consumers live, the type of plan they choose, and their insurer.",
      "For example, Maryland insurers have requested increases ranging from 8.1% to 18.7% for the upcoming plan year, according to an analysis of a smaller set of insurers by Georgetown University researchers. A much larger swing is seen in New York, where one carrier is asking for less than a 1% increase, while another wants 66%. Maryland rate filings indicated the average statewide increase would shrink to 7.9% from 17.1% \u2014 if the ACA's enhanced tax credits are extended.",
      "Most insurers are asking for 10% to 20% increases, the KFF report says, with several factors driving those increases. For instance, insurers say underlying medical costs \u2014 including the use of expensive obesity drugs \u2014 will add about 8% to premiums for next year. And most insurers are also adding 4% above what they would have charged had the enhanced tax credits been renewed.",
      "But rising premiums are just part of the picture.",
      "A bigger potential change for consumers' pocketbooks hinges on whether Congress decides to extend more generous tax credits first put in place during President Joe Biden's term as part of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, then extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.",
      "Those laws raised the subsidy amounts people could receive based on their household income and local premium costs and removed a cap that had barred higher earners from even partial subsidy assistance. Higher earners could still qualify for some subsidy but first had to chip in 8.5% of their household income toward the premiums.",
      "Across the board, but especially among lower-income policyholders, bigger subsidies helped fuel record enrollment in ACA plans.",
      "But they're also costly.",
      "A permanent extension could cost $335 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Such an extension was left out of the policy law Mr. Trump signed on July 4 that he called the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\" Without action, the extra subsidies will expire at the end of this year, after which the tax credits will revert to less generous pre-pandemic levels.",
      "That means two things: Most enrollees will be on the hook to pay a larger share of their premiums as assistance from federal tax credits declines. Secondly, people whose household income exceeds four times the federal poverty level \u2014 $84,600 for a couple or $128,600 for a family of four this year \u2014 won't get any subsidies at all.",
      "If the subsidies expire, policy experts estimate, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise by an average of more than 75%. In some states, ACA premiums could double.",
      "\"There will be sticker shock,\" said Josh Schultz, strategic engagement manager at Softheon, a New York consulting firm that provides enrollment, billing, and other services to about 200 health insurers, many of which are bracing for enrollment losses.",
      "And enrollment could fall sharply. The Wakely Consulting Group estimates that the combination of expiring tax credits, the Trump law's new paperwork, and other requirements will result in ACA enrollment dropping by as much as 57%.",
      "According to KFF, insurers added premium increases of around 4% just to cover the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, which they fear will lead to lower enrollment. That would further raise costs, insurers say, because people who are less healthy are more likely to grit their teeth and reenroll, leaving insurers with a smaller, but sicker, pool of members.",
      "Less common in the filings submitted so far, but noticeable, are increases pegged to Trump administration tariffs, Cox said.",
      "\"What they are assuming is tariffs will drive drug costs up significantly, with some saying that can have around a 3-percentage-point increase\" in premiums as a result, she said.",
      "Consumers will learn their new premium prices only late in the fall, or when open enrollment for the ACA begins on Nov. 1 and they can start shopping around.",
      "Congress could still act, and discussions are ongoing, said insurance broker Brooker.",
      "Some lawmakers, he said, are consulting with the CBO about the fiscal and coverage effects of various scenarios that don't extend the subsidies as they currently exist but may offer a middle ground. One possibility involves allowing subsidies for families earning as much as five or six times the poverty level, he said.",
      "But any such effort will draw pushback.",
      "Some conservative think tanks, such as the Paragon Health Institute, say the more generous subsides led people to fudge their incomes to qualify and led to other types of fraud, such as brokers signing people up for ACA plans without authorization.",
      "But others note that many consumers \u2014 Democratic and Republican \u2014 have come to rely on the additional assistance. Not extending it could be risky politically. In 2024, 56% of ACA enrollees lived in Republican congressional districts, and 76% were in states won by Mr. Trump.",
      "Allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire could also reshape the market.",
      "Brooker said some people may drop coverage. Others will shift to plans with lower premiums but higher deductibles. One provision of Mr. Trump's new tax law allows people enrolled in either \"bronze\" or \"catastrophic\"-level ACA plans, which are usually the cheapest, to qualify for health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside money, tax-free, to cover health care costs.",
      "\"Naturally, if rates do start going up the way we anticipate, there will be a migration to lower-cost options,\" Brooker said.",

      "Many travelers to the U.S. are now subject to a new $250 \"visa integrity fee,\" part of the tax cuts and spending law signed by President Trump on July 4.",
      "The fee is effective in the current federal fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2024, and ends on Sept. 30, 2025, according to the text of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. For subsequent years, the amount will be adjusted for inflation, the law states.",
      "The fee applies to visitors who come to the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, such as foreign students attending American universities or workers who receive temporary work visas such as\u00a0the H-1B, which is often used by companies to hire foreign engineers or other skilled workers.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. issued more than 10 million nonimmigrant visas, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the U.S. State Department.",
      "Visa holders subjected to the fee may later be reimbursed as long as they comply with their visa's restrictions, such as leaving the U.S. within five days of the visa's expiration, according to the new law. However, the law doesn't specify how visa holders may apply for reimbursement of the fee, nor how the fee will be collected.",
      "\"The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill provides the necessary policies and resources to restore integrity in our nation's immigration system,\" it added.",
      "Given that fee isn't yet set up to be collected, it's unclear whether the visa integrity fee will be retroactive. The Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately respond to a question about whether the fee would be collected retroactively.",
      "Fee for asylum seekers",
      "The new fee will add to the hurdles facing immigrants, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan think tank focused on immigration issues. It noted the new bill also includes additional new charges, including a new $100 fee for people applying for asylum.",
      "\"These fees, many of which are authorized to be layered on top of existing fees, are largely mandatory, effectively putting legal pathways out of reach for thousands of people,\" the group\u00a0said\u00a0in a July 14 statement.",
      "For instance, student visa applicants already must pay an $185 application fee and a $350 fee for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. The additional $250 fee will bring their total cost to $785.",

      "Millions of taxpayers could see a lower tax bill next year due to the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump, with a recent analysis finding that every income group will see some savings.",
      "On average, taxpayers will save about $2,900 per household in 2026, according to the analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank focused on taxes. But higher-income Americans are more likely to see a bigger relative boost than lower-income households, their analysis found.",
      "The new law extends the tax cuts in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with many of those provisions otherwise slated to expire at year-end. But the legislation also adds a bevy of new tax breaks, ranging from eliminating taxes on overtime and tips to lifting the state and local taxes deduction from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "About $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people who earn incomes of about $217,000 or more, the Tax Policy Center analysis found.",
      "\"Average tax cuts are generally larger as a percentage of after-tax income for higher income households than for lower income households,\" it noted.",
      "For instance, the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments next year, or 0.8% of their income.",
      "But those in the top quintile, or who earn $217,101 or more, will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their incomes, the analysis found.",
      "To be sure, an individual's tax savings next year will depend on a number of variables, such as their number of children, which allows people to claim the Child Tax Credit, or whether they can tap one of the new tax breaks, such as the elimination of taxes on some tipped income.",
      "More than 6 in 10 adults said they believe the new law would do more to help wealthy Americans than other income groups, according to a July 18 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. About 60% said they expect the law will hurt low-income people, the survey found.",
      "Aside from extending and instituting new tax cuts, the law also slashes spending in some social safety net programs, including Medicaid and food stamps.",

    "summary": "Bankruptcy filing alleges Steward Health Care executives siphoned $245 million from needy hospitals.",
    "story": [
      "Steward Health Care, an embattled hospital chain that has been the focus of federal scrutiny, has filed new court papers blaming the company's financial woes on its founding chief executive. The company alleges that the ex-CEO and three former colleagues misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars and drove the chain into bankruptcy.",
      "Steward accuses its founder Ralph de la Torre and three others\u00a0 \u2014 Michael Callum, James Karam, and Sanjay Shetty \u2014 of defrauding the company of more than $245 million.",
      "\"Through their greed and bad faith misconduct, [these former insiders] operated Steward with the aim of enriching themselves at the expense of the Company, its creditors, and the patients and communities that Steward served,\" the new filing alleges. \"These insiders pilfered Steward's assets for their own material gain, while leaving the Company and its hospitals perpetually undercapitalized and insolvent.\"",
      "Once the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, Steward operated hospitals in Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania and other states. CBS News found that de la Torre pushed for the company's expansion. By working with a real estate investment firm, Medical Properties Trust, de la Torre helped purchase new medical properties, sell off the real estate, and force the hospitals into costly lease-back arrangements.",
      "A CBS News investigation that spanned nearly two years documented allegations of\u00a0 how private equity investors and de la Torre followed this formula, extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends from the real estate sales, while health care workers and patients struggled to get the life-saving supplies they needed as a result.",
      "Records reviewed by CBS News showed Steward hospitals around the country left a trail of unpaid bills, at times risking a shortage of potentially life-saving supplies. That included a case in a Massachusetts hospital where medical staff says a device that could have stopped the bleeding in a new mother's liver was repossessed by the manufacturer weeks earlier. After being transferred to another hospital, the young woman died just hours after giving birth to her first daughter.",
      "Last August, after filing for bankruptcy, the company sold off six Massachusetts hospitals. The sale of the final two facilities in the state left about 1,200 workers jobless, according to state officials. In a 2024 interview with CBS News, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey did not hold back in her assessment of the conduct of Steward executives.",
      "\"I'm disgusted. It's selfish. It's greed,\" she said.",
      "At the time of the patient's death, a spokesperson for Steward told CBS News company executives always put patients first and said they \"deny that any other considerations were placed ahead of that guiding principle.\"",
      "In an earlier statement, the spokesperson said Steward \"has actively and meaningfully invested\" in its hospital system since its formation, including in Massachusetts, where it took over hospitals that were \"failing\" and \"about to close.\"",
      "De la Torre also defended the company's actions.",
      "\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" de la Torre said in a company statement in 2024.",
      "This week's complaint lists three major transactions that de la Torre and executives allegedly profited from while leaving Steward hospitals struggling for funds to operate.",
      "In January 2021, de la Torre allegedly took a $111 million dividend payout while the company was struggling financially. The former CEO also pocketed $81.5 million according to the complaint. The court filing also lists the former executives who benefited: Callum, who as vice president for physician services at Steward received $10.3 million. Shetty, then-president of Steward Health Care System received $1.8 million and Karam, who remains a member of Steward's board, received $728,456.",
      "The complaint also claims Steward Health Care International, the international arm of Steward that's majority-owned by de la Torre, received $4.3 million of the dividend payout.",
      "Later that year, Steward claims de la Torre overpaid by $200 million for five Miami-based hospitals acquired from Tenet Healthcare Corporation. The complaint alleges the former CEO pushed for the $1.1 billion deal based on his \"personal desire to build a hospital empire in the Miami area, rather than on any independent financial analysis.\"",
      "According to the complaint, de la Torre then sold assets related to Steward's Medicare Advantage business to a company called CareMax in 2022.",
      "Steward, through its physicians organization, allegedly received $60.5 million in cash, while the bulk of the proceeds \u2014 almost $134 million in stock of CareMax \u2014 ultimately went to a holding company that was majority-owned by de la Torre, Callum, Shetty and Karam. The complaint alleges de la Torre and named board members \"sold valuable\" assets and \"diverted the proceeds to themselves\" while the company went insolvent.",
      "\"De la Torre, Callum, and Karam were grossly negligent and breached their duties of care, loyalty, and good faith,\" according to the filing.",
      "CareMax filed for bankruptcy in February.",
      "While Steward's hospitals were struggling, CBS News previously reported on de la Torre's lavish personal spending, including the purchase of a $30 million yacht in 2021, a multimillion-dollar Texas horse ranch in 2022, and two corporate jets valued at $95 million.",
      "Steward Health Care is now being run by a court-appointed administrator and is trying to claw back funds from its former leaders to pay off its creditors.",
      "De la Torre, who founded the company in 2010, is at the center of a federal probe focused on potential fraud, embezzlement and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, sources told CBS News. In 2024, he refused to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that had been looking into Steward's bankruptcy, despite being issued a subpoena. Senators took the rare step of holding him in contempt for that failure to appear.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "story": [
      "Air travelers may soon see another change when passing through security checkpoints at airports, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting there may be changes to current TSA restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags.",
      "The potential change in policies around carrying liquids on flights comes after Noem on July 8 said passengers at airports no longer have to remove their shoes during regular TSA security checks. That change went into effect immediately.",
      "Speaking at a conference hosted Wednesday by publication The Hill, Noem said she's questioning \"everything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Travelers generally must empty or throw away their water bottles before going through a TSA checkpoint, or else pack containers with more than 3.4 ounces of liquid in their checked baggage. There are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "The TSA has been exploring the liquids issue for years, former TSA Administrator John Pistole told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave earlier this month. The TSA has been installing new computed tomography, or CT, checkpoint scanners at airports, which generates a 3-D image of a bag's content and which can automatically detect other potential security hazards.",
      "When were liquids restricted on planes?",
      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\"Hopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\" she said. \"It takes you one minute.\"",

    "story": [
      "Older Americans are kicking the can down the road on retirement over concerns about the economy and their own financial readiness to step back from work.",
      "That's according to a new survey from F&G Annuities & Life, which polled 2,000 U.S. adults over 50 years old. The life insurance and annuities company found that 23% of those polled have already decided to delay their retirement as they grapple with questions about their financial readiness, up from 14% in 2024.",
      "The findings come at a time when the median savings of 55-year-olds is just $50,000, far from enough to fund a secure old age, according to\u00a0another recent study\u00a0by Prudential Financial.",
      "The F&G survey provides a snapshot into the thinking of Gen X, ages 45 to 60, whose oldest members are now entering their pre-retirement years. The\u00a0average retirement age\u00a0in the United States is 62, which is also the earliest age at which people can start claiming Social Security benefits.",
      "The longer a person waits to claim Social Security, the higher benefit they'll receive from the program. The full retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67, at which point workers can receive their full benefits. Those who delay claiming until age 70, however, can get another 24% boost to their monthly checks.",
      "Among the 23% in the F&G study who plan to delay claims on their Social Security benefits, half cited financial uncertainties or economic volatility as the reason for their decision to delay retirement \u2014 a 10% increase from last year. Forty-four percent said they are worried about inflation, while 34% indicated they are worried about a recession or stock market downturn.",
      "They're not the only ones, according to David John, a senior policy adviser at AARP.\u00a0 The majority of Americans nearing retirement age are unsure of whether they will have enough money to make it through retirement as they fret over inflation and general economy uncertainty, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Along those lines, Johns said he's also observed that people are cutting back on their retirement savings or pulling money out of retirement savings to deal with unexpected costs or inflationary pressures.",
      "\"Of course, that helps in the short run, but that means that you have even more people who have worries once they start to get to retirement,\" he said.",
      "Unlike 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, Social Security benefits are protected from inflation because the agency institutes a cost-of-living adjustment each year, John pointed out. To guard against disruptions to retirement plans, John suggests that people consistently put away money \u2014 even if it's just a small amount each month.",

    "summary": "President Trump threatens to raise tariffs, claiming the European Union won't buy U.S. cars or food \u2014 but 2024 trade data shows otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-judge-reverses-medical-debt-rule-credit-reports-cfpb/",
    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 14:19:29 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling targets a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical debt from 15 million credit reports.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "story": [
      "An appellate court has allowed the Trump administration to end a program that grants temporary deportation protections and work permits to more than 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon.",
      "In a brief order Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote that the plaintiff \u2014 an immigration advocacy group called CASA \u2014 has a plausible case against the administration for choosing to end temporary protected status, or TPS, for Afghans and Cameroonians. But the court said \"there is insufficient evidence to warrant the extraordinary remedy\" of blocking the government from phasing out TPS while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.",
      "One week ago, the appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS for Afghanistan for one week, while it considered the merits of CASA's case.",
      "The administration had planned to end the program for Afghans last week. The program is set to end for Cameroonians in two weeks, on Aug. 4.",
      "The appellate court on Monday directed a lower court to \"move expeditiously\" to hear the case.",
      "Around\u00a011,700 Afghans\u00a0and\u00a05,200 Cameroonians\u00a0are enrolled in TPS, the government estimates. But roughly 3,600 of the Afghans and 200 of the Cameroonians have green cards, so they will not be affected. Those who lose their TPS protections can apply for asylum or some other form of legal status, but otherwise, they will be at risk of deportation.",
      "AfghanEvac, a group that has helped relocate Afghans, said in a statement it is \"deeply alarmed\" by Monday's ruling.",
      "\"Lives will be upended. Families will be separated. Allies will be detained, deported, or forced into hiding\u2014while their legal rights remain unsettled,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in a statement Monday night.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and CASA for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought for months to roll back TPS, a program that allows the government to grant relief from deportation and work permits for people whose home countries are deemed unsafe due to natural disasters or war.",
      "The government argues that the TPS program is intended to be temporary, and Cameroon and Afghanistan are now safe enough for TPS recipients to return.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration said Afghanistan's security situation and economy have improved despite the Taliban's 2021 takeover of the country following the U.S. military's withdrawal. And the government said a pair of armed conflicts in Cameroon \u2014 including a separatist conflict and an insurgency by the extremist group Boko Haram, which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2013 \u2014 are \"contained in limited regions\" and don't imperil people's personal safety in most of the country.",
      "\"This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a May statement announcing the Afghanistan decision.",
      "The State Department has placed a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory on Afghanistan, warning of the risk of \"civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities.\"  The department advises travelers to Cameroon to exercise caution, and not to travel to certain parts of the country due to armed violence, crime and terrorism.",
      "CASA has argued in court papers that both countries are unsafe, and TPS recipients could be endangered if they're forced to return to their home countries. The group says the conflict in Cameroon \u2014 which involves English-speaking separatists in a mostly French-speaking country \u2014 has created a humanitarian crisis and wrecked the African country's economy. And people from Afghanistan, the group notes, were made eligible for TPS because of repression by the Taliban and conflict between the group and ISIS-K insurgents.",
      "CASA also argues the administration hasn't followed the correct legal processes to end TPS, and contends the decision was \"preordained\" and based partly on \"racial animus.\"",
      "\"That animus is evidenced by the Trump Administration's efforts to eliminate lawful immigration status for noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominantly non-white, while simultaneously removing immigration barriers to noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominately white,\" the group said.",
      "Earlier this month, a lower court judge denied DHS's request to dismiss CASA's lawsuit, but also denied CASA's motion to halt the administration's policy. CASA appealed, causing it to reach the 4th Circuit.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to wind down TPS for hundreds of thousands of other migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti. In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS for Venezuelan migrants.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge overseeing his criminal case to put off his release from custody for 30 days if the judge rejects a Justice Department bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting a trial.",
      "Abrego Garcica's lawyers said in a filing that the 30-day pause in issuing a release order would give him time to evaluate his legal options in response to likely efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to deport him.",
      "\"We have been advised by the government that if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings,\" they wrote.",
      "The Justice Department does not object to the request, and Abrego Garcia's legal team said that the delay would not affect their ability to come up with a proposed schedule leading up to his criminal trial.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted Abrego Garcia\u00a0in late May on two counts of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to both counts. A trial in his case is set to begin in January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, but his removal gained headlines after a federal immigration official acknowledged it was an administrative error. An immigration judge had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented DHS from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland after coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011, and his wife filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump administration in March challenging his removal, and a federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "After weeks of back-and-forth \u2014 and his case reaching the Supreme Court \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in early June that Abrego Garcia had been released from Salvadoran custody and brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from his alleged participation in a scheme to smuggle undocumented migrants into the country.",
      "A federal magistrate judge last month ordered Abrego Garcia's release from federal law enforcement custody while he awaits a trial, but that raised concerns that he would be swiftly detained by immigration agents and possibly deported. The Justice Department appealed that decision and asked a U.S. district judge to revoke the release order.",
      "The judge overseeing the criminal case, Waverly Crenshaw, held a hearing last week on the government's motion but has not yet ruled on whether to grant it. If Crenshaw denies the bid, it would give the green-light for Abrego Garcia to be released from criminal custody.",
      "But the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings has created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "In the ongoing civil case in Maryland, the federal judge is considering a separate request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers to return him to Maryland immediately after he is released from confinement in the criminal proceedings that are ongoing in Tennessee. They also asked the judge to bar the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",

      "The federal government on Monday released thousands of records on the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 a move that was ordered by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents, which number over 230,000 pages, \"had never been digitized and sat collecting dust in facilities across the federal government for decades, until today.\"",
      "The records include the FBI's \"discussion of potential leads, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and documents related to James Earl Ray's former cellmate, who stated he discussed with Ray an alleged assassination plot,\" according to ODNI. The agency says the release also includes CIA records on the search for Ray, who fled the U.S. before he was eventually captured and pleaded guilty to assassinating King.",
      "\"The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government's investigation into Dr. King's assassination,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "ODNI called Monday's release \"the first time these records are published online in one collection with minimal redactions,\" though it said some records had been made public previously through Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "ODNI said King's relatives were \"provided an opportunity to review the files\" two weeks ago.",
      "Prior to the release, some relatives of King pushed back on the plan: \"For us, the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.\"",
      "King's two living children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, said in a statement Monday they understood the records have \"long been a subject of interest,\" but urged people to engage with the files \"with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continued grief.\"",
      "The statement \u2014 released by the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change \u2014 pointed to the FBI's yearslong surveillance of King in the 1960s, which a Justice Department report later concluded was \"very probably\" illegal.",
      "\"While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,\" the family members said. \"Those who promote the fruit of the FBI's surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.\"",
      "Bernice King addressed the release of the files in a \"Vanity Fair\" story Monday, writing, \"I wonder why I have to be confronted once again with something that was very confusing and distressing for me as a five-year-old. I am, honestly, not prepared to revisit the gruesome details of this painful history. For me, there is no real value in it; there is only reliving the trauma.\" Later Monday, she wrote on X, \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",
      "King's niece, Alveda King, said in ODNI's statement she supported the release, calling it \"a historic step towards the truth that the American people deserve.\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump ordered the government to declassify and release federal records on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, along with the 1968 killings of King and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Records on JFK were released in March, and the government released several tranches of documents on RFK starting in April.",
      "All three assassinations have drawn decades of public curiosity, including theories about whether the people accused and convicted of assassinating the three men acted alone or were even responsible for the killings.",
      "Ray pleaded guilty to murdering King in Memphis one year after the assassination, and was sentenced to 99 years in prison, but he later recanted his guilty plea and spent years unsuccessfully seeking a new trial. He died in 1998.",
      "Members of King's family have contended that Ray was not the shooter. Their statement Monday pointed to a 1999 wrongful death suit in Tennessee civil court in which a jury concluded a man named Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators, \"including government agencies,\" were linked to King's assassination.",
      "Other official findings have varied. The Justice Department conducted reviews of the assassination in 1977 and 2000, which asserted that Ray was the assassin and that he didn't act as part of a conspiracy. In the 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that King was likely assassinated as part of a conspiracy involving Ray, but that the government wasn't involved.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:23:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard released a memorandum and files regarding the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions during the 2016 election.",
    "story": [
      "The release of more than 100 pages of declassified files and a memorandum by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reignited political battles over Russia's actions during the 2016 presidential election, a topic that has long incensed President Trump and put the actions of the U.S. intelligence community in partisan crosshairs.",
      "Gabbard's office on Friday alleged in the memorandum, which accompanied the files, that they contained what she called evidence of \"suppression\" and manipulation of the intelligence underlying a 2017 community-wide assessment of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The files include email exchanges, excerpts from a President's Daily Brief and a readout from a principals committee meeting, chiefly from a period during the Obama administration.",
      "In a statement and social media posts, Gabbard claimed the materials, which were marked declassified on July 17, 2025, were evidence of a \"treasonous conspiracy\" and \"years-long coup\" plotted by Obama administration officials against Mr. Trump, and said she would forward them to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal referral. She also said in subsequent media appearances that more declassifications about the matter would be made.",
      "Democrats fiercely disputed her claims, pointing to the findings of a bipartisan Senate investigation that concluded Russia had attempted to influence the 2016 election. They accused Gabbard herself of misrepresenting intelligence findings and processes.",
      "\"What you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt,\" said Congressman Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday.",
      "\"[T]he intelligence community is full of very good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest,\" Himes said.",
      "\"This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement.",
      "The memorandum released by Gabbard appears to conflate different kinds of Russian operations during the 2016 election cycle while alleging Obama administration officials fabricated a narrative designed to undermine Mr. Trump. It points several times to select phrases in the documents that say Russia lacked the intent or the capability to use cyber operations to target U.S. election infrastructure, change vote tallies, and overturn the election \u2014 which previous investigations agreed did not happen.",
      "But while no evidence emerged to indicate Russia engaged in a vote-switching cyberattack, there was evidence that showed a multi-pronged Kremlin influence campaign that attempted to sway American voters. That influence campaign included hack-and-leak operations and social media posts designed to undermine the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and bolster then-candidate Trump's, according to the intelligence community's assessment.",
      "In the years after the 2016 presidential election, multiple reviews of the intelligence community's findings \u2014 including the Senate report and an investigation led by special counsel John Durham, who was appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 reinforced its conclusions.",
      "A CIA review of the tradecraft involved in the agency's assessment released earlier this month found some of its judgments may have been rushed and the confidence levels attached to one of them may have been too high, but it did not change the conclusion that Russia's efforts were designed to benefit Mr. Trump's candidacy.",
      "Gabbard's statements on Friday were praised and recirculated multiple times by the president, senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton wrote in a social media post, \"It will take decades for the Intelligence Community to recover from the damage done during the Obama and Biden presidencies.\"",
      "Senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote that Gabbard had \"exposed the startling depths of a seditious coup against the Republic.\"",
      "The memorandum also criticizes leaks from what it terms \"IC officials\" or \"Deep State officials in the IC\" \u2014 with \"IC\" referring to the intelligence community \u2014 to media outlets at the time the assessments were being drafted that said Russia had intervened in the election in an effort to help President Trump. The memo does not, however, identify these individuals or provide other evidence about the origin of those disclosures.",
      "It also highlights instances in which certain agencies disputed or pushed to change language included in evolving intelligence assessments of Russia's cyber activity. For instance, it cites an FBI official who suggested in an exchange in September of 2016 that language about Russia's intent to use cyber attacks to disrupt the 2016 election be \"softened.\"",
      "\"[W]e would prefer for the first sentence regarding Russia's intent to be softened,\" the official wrote. \"The way it currently reads, it would indicate that we have definitive information that Russia does intend to disrupt our elections and we are uncomfortable making that assessment at this point.\"",
      "Dissents from different agencies are common and conclusions can change as more intelligence is collected or analysis is done, according to current and former officials familiar with the drafting process for intelligence assessments. It is not clear from the redacted selection of emails released by Gabbard how the language flagged by the FBI was finalized.",

      "A Wall Street Journal reporter was slated to join the president and a small group of other reporters aboard Air Force One as a part of the traveling press pool for Mr. Trump's trip to Scotland later this month. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that because of what she called the paper's \"fake and defamatory conduct,\" the Wall Street Journal will not participate. Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit over the story on Friday, asking for at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "\"Thirteen diverse outlets will participate in the press pool to cover the president's trip to Scotland. Due to the Wall Street Journal's fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"Every news organization in the entire world wishes to cover President Trump, and the White House has taken significant steps to include as many voices as possible.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal has not yet responded to a request for comment. The paper has stood by its reporting.",
      "On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0published a story\u00a0claiming the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003.",
      "The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\" CBS News has not reviewed or verified the letter.",
      "Mr. Trump is visiting his ancestral home of Scotland from July 25-29, with stops in Aberdeen and Turnberry, where he owns golf courses.",
      "Being a part of the press pool allows a small but rotating group of reporters access to the president's daily happenings and travels, often offering journalists opportunities to ask questions of the president.",
      "The White House Correspondents' Association urged the Trump administration to reverse its decision.",
      "\"This attempt by the White House to punish a media outlet whose coverage it does not like is deeply troubling, and it defies the First Amendment. Government retaliation against news outlets based on the content of their reporting should concern all who value free speech and an independent media,\" said WHCA President Weijia Jiang, who also serves as CBS News' senior White House correspondent.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted more power over the press pool than prior administrations, which have usually deferred to the White House press corps to decide who participates and when.",
      "The Associated Press's access to\u00a0spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One was curtailed earlier this year for not abiding by Mr. Trump's decision to change the Gulf of Mexico's name to the Gulf of America. The wire service sued over the change, winning an early victory in district court, but an appeals court eventually let the Trump administration limit the AP's access to restricted spaces.",
      "\"As the appeals court confirmed, the Wall Street Journal or any other news outlet are not guaranteed special access to cover President Trump in the Oval Office, aboard Air Force One, and in his private workspaces,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",

      "Sen. Maria Cantwell is urging President Trump to prioritize modernizing the nation's weather forecasting system, saying the investment will save lives as well as money down the road. She released a letter to the president Monday, following through on her pledge to provide guidance that the administration can use to upgrade weather forecasting infrastructure.",
      "\"The money will save you money, for sure,\" Cantwell said in an interview on CBS News Monday. \"The kind of investments you could make here are about taking a $20 billion [disaster] event and saying, if we would have done these things in advance, it wouldn't have cost us that much money. If storms are costing us this much, we have to come up with better solutions.\"",
      "The Democratic congresswoman, a prominent voice in environmental policy on Capitol Hill and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees weather and disasters. Cantwell penned the letter in the wake of disastrous flooding that killed at least 135 people in Central Texas. The July 4 flash flood prompted a massive search and recovery operations and raised questions about whether forecasts and warnings could have been more effective\u00a0ahead of time.",
      "Cantwell's letter outlined five bipartisan recommendations to improve U.S. forecasting. It comes as\u00a0the Trump administration continues to make cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency focused on weather and climate, and the National Weather Service, its subagency in charge of daily forecasts.",
      "NOAA\u00a0is slated to see a 27% reduction in its budget at the start of the 2026 fiscal year, which could impact weather forecasting in a number of ways, including terminating research programs aimed at helping predict future precipitation rates and improve flash flood warning systems. The committee recently held a confirmation hearing for Dr. Neil Jacobs to become NOAA's new leader.",
      "\"Communities across the United States are experiencing more frequent, intense, and costly flash floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, atmospheric rivers, landslides, heatwaves, and wildfires,\" Cantwell's letter said. She cited deadly \u2014 and costly \u2014 natural disasters that have ravaged communities around the United States in the last two years alone, including the Texas floods as well as last year's flooding from Hurricane Helene in\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0and the devastating fires in\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0and the Hawaiian island of Maui.",
      "Examples like these suggest \"that providing Americans with more timely and accurate weather information can avoid billions in property losses and save lives,\" she wrote.",
      "Responding to the letter, a White House spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that \"the Trump administration has already been hard at work on re-orienting NOAA and NWS [the National Weather Service] away from pursuing climate change activism to instead focus on its core mission and modernizing the agencies' outdated technology to provide faster, more accurate weather models.\"",
      "Cantwell's recommendations emphasize improvements in how weather data is collected and analyzed, as well as systems for notifying communities of severe weather. They include:",
      "Upgrading the country's Doppler radar network with \"phased array radar,\" a higher resolution system to monitor weather conditions, profile wind patterns and perform aircraft tracking simultaneously. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said this type of radar allows for more \"focused observations of storms,\" compared with Doppler's abilities, and provides quicker updates for meteorologists tasked with predicting and alerting the public to sudden changes during an extreme event.Replacing older weather satellites, relied on by NOAA and its National Weather Service, with next-generation satellites, which \"can track lightning strikes that start wildfires, wildfire smoke, red tides that poison fisheries, and generally provide better extreme weather early warning capabilities,\" according to Cantwell's letter.Improving NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System, which uses instruments like buoys to collects ocean data that is often integral to weather forecasting, including for search and rescue initiatives and navigation more broadly.Investing in supercomputing, data analytics, and a forecasting technique called data assimilation, to increase the accuracy of NOAA's weather prediction model, which tends to be less accurate than its European counterpart.Bolstering weather and climate research through NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. The office is a bedrock of climate prediction efforts worldwide, multiple meteorologists currently and formerly employed by the federal agency have told CBS News.

    "published": "Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:56:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump said he wants a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' congressional map \u2014 it would enable Republicans to pick up five seats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Texas Legislature is convening Monday for a special session where it will attempt to redraw the state's congressional map to boost President Trump and his allies' efforts to maintain the GOP's grip on the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The state's decision to recraft the boundaries of House districts comes midway through the decade and several years after its GOP-controlled Legislature adopted a redistricting plan in the wake of the 2020 Census.",
      "Under that plan, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. (The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open.)",
      "But with Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and the risk the GOP could lose control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, a reshaping of the congressional districts could give Mr. Trump's party an edge heading into next year's elections.",
      "Mr. Trump's political team had been pushing Texas GOP leaders to look into redrawing the state's congressional map, The New York Times reported last month. Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed the Legislature would undertake the effort, among 17 other agenda items, when it meets. Ahead of the start of the special session, the Texas House speaker announced the creation of a new 21-member select committee on congressional redistricting. The panel consists of 12 Republican state House members and nine Democrats.",
      "\"I don't think this has anything to do with Texas \u2014 this has to do with Trump,\" said Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project. \"This has nothing to do with the internal dynamics of the state, the political trajectory of the state. This is purely about this election cycle and one person's benefit.\"",
      "How did we get here?",
      "States undergo the redistricting process after every 10-year census, when voting lines are redrawn to account for population changes. After the 2020 Census, Texas crafted a new congressional map to include two new districts, bringing its total number of House seats to 38.",
      "The maps drawn by the GOP-led Texas Legislature aimed to protect Republican seats in Congress and the statehouse. Democrats flipped two congressional districts and 12 state House seats in the 2018 midterms.",
      "\"In 2021, they spent a lot of time and effort making sure they had the best maps possible with the primary goal to ensure that the Republican majority was rock solid,\" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. \"And they created 24 of 38 districts where there is no way, shape or form that a Republican is losing those districts, absent some type of murder indictment or a serial adulterer, etc.\"",
      "But the final version of the congressional map was met with criticism, and it has been challenged in court. Among the issues raised by voting rights groups is that 95% of Texas' growth has been driven by non-White voters, but the map crafted in 2021 created more majority-White districts.",
      "A three-judge panel in El Paso is currently considering a consolidated challenge to the map brought by voting rights groups, Latino voters and lawmakers. The plaintiffs argue that the new lines violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. A trial ended in June.",
      "Texas has a part-time Legislature, which meets for 140 days every two years. The governor has the power to call special sessions to cover specific topics, and the special sessions constitutionally cannot last longer than 30 days. The governor can, however, call as many special sessions as he deems necessary. After the 88th legislative session in 2023, Abbott called four special sessions that stretched into December.",
      "Redistricting is one of 18 topics that Abbott has asked the Legislature to address. Four of those topics include disaster relief for the Central Texas floods and improving the state's warning system.",
      "\"I'm not convinced that the goal is to pass everything, but ultimately, Abbott gets the credit for trying, and the Legislature will get the credit for what it can accomplish, but it'll also get the blame for what it fails to do,\" Blank said.",
      "Although the Democrats could leave the state to deny Republicans a quorum, like they did in 2021 to protest a voting bill, it's unlikely they would do so if it meant holding up flood relief.",
      "Where does Trump and his administration come into play?",
      "Texas has conducted two congressional elections under the 2021 map. But earlier this month, the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter alleging that some of the districts were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, specifically pinpointed four districts \u2014 the 9th, 18th, 29th and 33rd \u2014 that she said constitute \"coalition districts\" that should be redrawn. All three are currently represented by Democrats, and Turner, who died in March, represented the fourth.",
      "Coalition districts are those that bring two or more racial minorities together to make up a majority of the population, and where voters from these groups vote together to elect their preferred candidate.",
      "In her letter, Dhillon wrote that the state had to \"immediately\" rectify the alleged racial gerrymanders, and if it chose not to, it was at risk of legal action by the attorney general.",
      "\"The congressional districts at issue are nothing more than vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas,\" she wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to be on board with the recrafting of Texas' voting boundaries. Before leaving the White House on Tuesday, the president said he is looking for a \"simple redrawing\" where Republicans pick up five seats.",
      "\"Texas would be the biggest one,\" he said.",
      "But during the trial in the case involving the congressional map, state officials repeatedly said they were motivated not by race when they drew the district lines, but instead driven by politics. State Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican who led the 2021 Senate Redistricting Committee, testified that the congressional map was \"drawn blind to race\" and \"racial data was not considered at all during the drawing of the maps,\" according to court records.",
      "\"There is no legal justification for doing this. It sort of walks and talks and quacks like a political move,\" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \"The problem is that it's really difficult to get more seats in Texas without heavily undermining the political power of communities of color.\"",
      "In claims of racial gerrymandering, those challenging a map have to show that race predominated for how the lines were drawn.",
      "\"This can't be a racial gerrymander if they didn't consider race,\" Li said. \"This is a textbook, easy it's-not-a-racial-gerrymander. \u2026 If you didn't consider race, it can't be a racial gerrymander.\"",
      "Has Texas drawn new maps in the middle of the decade before?",
      "A divided Texas Legislature drew up a congressional map in 2001, but two years later, in a plan engineered by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, Republicans wanted to redraw the lines to make the most of the growing GOP majority in the state.",
      "Fifty-one Democrats in the state House fled to Oklahoma for four days, denying the Republicans the quorum they needed to bring the redistricting plan to the floor and letting the clock run out on the regular session. Then-Gov. Rick Perry called the Legislature back for a special session, but state Senate Democrats left the state to deny a quorum.",
      "Although the Democrats remained out of state for more than a month, they couldn't stop the maps from eventually passing, and Republicans ultimately picked up five seats. The Supreme Court upheld the congressional districts in 2018.",
      "But former Democratic Rep. Mark Strama, who ran for office after that round of redistricting, warned the effort did have some downsides for Republicans. The drama was covered nationally, and Strama himself flipped a Central Texas district in 2005.",
      "\"Voters were mad at both sides,\" Strama said. \"They hate all these political shenanigans. But there's no question voters hate this.\"",
      "While Texas has redrawn the lines of congressional districts in the middle of a decade before, Li said the current situation is far from normal.",
      "\"Outside of litigation, it is extremely rare,\" he said. \"And it's exceptionally rare \u2014 in fact, I can't think of another circumstance, where a party drew the map, and then that same party redrew the map. Where there are mid-decade redistrictings, it's usually because political control changes hands.\"",
      "Could this plan backfire?",
      "While Democrats have not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, the best year Democrats have had at the ballot in the past two decades was in 2018. In that midterm election, former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within three points of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and Democrats flipped two congressional seats and 12 state House seats.",
      "Republicans have managed to quell those gains and, as Jones noted, the 2024 election was a high point for the party. But the dynamics of the 2026 election could mirror those in 2018, when Democrats ran aggressive campaigns targeting Mr. Trump and retook the House. Any changes to the congressional map might not be enough to stem Democratic gains this time around.",
      "\"If Republicans do engage, do go all out and try with the goal of flipping, say three, four, even five seats as President Trump says \u2014 it's far more likely Republicans see a net loss than a net gain,\" Jones said.",
      "Plus, any map adopted by the GOP-led Legislature and approved by Abbott is likely to be swiftly met with lawsuits. If a federal court blocks its use, the new district lines may not even be in place for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"President Trump is talking about five more seats out of Texas, and the only way you get five more seats out of Texas is if you seriously undermine the political power and the political voice of communities of color,\" Li said. \"And that is a Texas-sized lawsuit with potentially huge ramifications.\"",
      "Li said the redrawing of political bounds to give Republicans a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections is not only a legally risky move, but could be politically perilous too.",
      "\"The essence of trying to get more seats is that you have to spread your voters out more if you're a Republican,\" he said. \"So you have a bunch more districts that you're not winning by 65 or 70%. You're going to have a bunch of districts that you're winning by 52, 53% and in a state that is changing as fast as Texas, that's growing as fast as Texas, that's changing demographically as fast as Texas. By 2030, these districts could look and perform very differently.\"",
      "The 2020 Census showed that people of color accounted for 95% of Texas' population growth over the prior decade. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau released last year also showed that the number of Asian Americans in Texas grew by nearly 92,000 people, while there were more than 91,000 new Black residents in the state.",
      "\"When you gerrymander, you're making a bet that you know what the politics of the future will look like,\" Li said. \"There are many places where you can safely bet on what the politics of the future will look like in the country. Texas is not one of those places. It's just changing too fast.\"",
      "Republicans have made big gains in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, once considered a Democratic stronghold. But even with those GOP gains \u2014 and running on the maps drawn in 2021\u00a0 \u2014 two of the three seats remained Democratic in 2024.",
      "\"People talk about the Rio Grande Valley as if it's somehow indicative of Texas,\" said Blank of the Texas Politics Project. \"It's less than 3.5% of the total statewide vote, and it's incredibly economically depressed and it's overwhelmingly Hispanic. It's not really indicative of any part of the state, it's indicative of its region of the country that happens to share a border with Mexico.\"",
      "What can Democrats do?",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the states have lambasted Republicans for pushing to redraw congressional district lines to hold onto power in the House.",
      "\"Elected officials should earn the support of voters they hope to represent,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday. \"Republicans want a country where politicians choose their voters, not the other way around. It reeks of desperation, and we're going to do everything that we can in Texas and beyond to respond.\"",
      "Jeffries said the reason for the special session in Texas is to \"try to steal the midterm elections by rigging\" the state's congressional map.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, has suggested that Democrats mount their own partisan gerrymander. California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats represent 43 of them.",
      "\"There are *currently* 9 Republicans in the California Congressional Delegation. Just thought folks might like to know that fun fact,\" he wrote on X\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "During an appearance on the podcast \"Pod Save America,\" Newsom accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the game\" because they're concerned about maintaining control of the House next year.",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that handed over the task of crafting congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But Newsom suggested there are still two paths that could lead to a new congressional map: calling a special session of the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot for a special election that would clear the way for new House district lines; or having the state Legislature create a new map under the idea that it's coming mid-decade and not after the census.",
      "\"It ups the stakes of the redistricting war, with the acknowledgment that Democrats have a limited hand to play,\" Li said of Texas' decision to draw new congressional lines.",
      "Just 15 states have Democratic trifectas, where they control the state legislature and the governorship. Two of those states, Colorado and Michigan, leave the drawing of political voting lines to independent commissions like California does. Republicans are in full control in 23 states.",
      "Plus, in other states where Democrats control the legislature and governor's mansions, the congressional delegations already heavily skew Democratic. In Illinois, for example, Democrats hold 14 of its 17 House seats. Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation contains just one Republican.",
      "Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a former House lawmaker who has left the door open for a Senate run next year, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" on Monday that Democrats should \"fight fire with fire,\" referring to Newsom's suggestion of taking on redistricting in California.",
      "\"Far too often, Democrats are more interested in being right than they are in being in power,\" O'Rourke said. \"If we're coloring in the lines while the Republicans are tearing up the coloring book right in front of us, we're going to continue to lose power and be less relevant to the Americans that we want to support and help\"",

      "The deployment of active-duty troops to city streets within the United States is rare, as is federalizing a state's National Guard despite objections from the state's governor. California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said the military presence was not necessary to respond to protests and could inflame the situation. Newsom sued over the National Guard deployment, arguing that Mr. Trump had \"unlawfully bypassed\" Newsom by sending in federal troops.",

      "Last week, the Pentagon released about 2,000 of the 4,000 members of the National Guard in L.A. With the Marines headed home, there are still about 2,000 guardsmen in the L.A. area to protect federal property and personnel as they conduct law enforcement.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:52:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The gap between the RNC and DNC is wider now than it was at this same stage of the first midterm cycle after Trump's 2016 victory.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican National Committee ended the first half of 2025 with a $65.56 million cash on hand advantage over the Democratic Party, as the left works to rebound from 2024 election losses and the right continues to deeply intertwine its future with President Trump.",
      "New campaign finance filings show the RNC had more than $80.7 million at the end of June, while the Democratic National Committee finished with around $15.2 million in cash on hand as both parties prepare for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"The RNC has been working hand in glove with President Trump's team to build the war chest needed to protect and expand our Republican majorities in Congress next year,\" RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said in a statement. \"Vice President Vance has done an amazing job as the RNC's finance chair working with Chairman Whatley to do just that, and we're not going to stop.\"",
      "The gap between the two is far wider than this same time period before the 2018 midterms, when the RNC's cash on hand advantage over the DNC was $37.2 million at the end of June 2017. The political dynamics at that point were similar to now, with President Trump months removed from winning the White House and Republicans controlling the House and Senate. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won back the House and started to build momentum that carried over into Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "While the midterms are still more than a year away, it already appears likely the House will be Democrats' easiest route to winning back power in Washington. Republicans are also contending with the potential challenge that often befalls the party of the president, where the midterms become a referendum on the commander in chief.",
      "Democrats are facing continued questions about their approach moving forward after last fall's election setbacks, where Mr. Trump won a second term as president and the party lost the Senate and failed to retake the House. Earlier this year, party leaders chose Ken Martin, then the head of Minnesota's Democratic Party, to take over the DNC in an attempt to gain stronger footing with next year's midterms and the 2028 presidential election in mind.",
      "But in his first months as party chair, Martin was forced to contend with intraparty tensions and disputes as he attempted to offer a stronger counter to Mr. Trump's second term and Republican control in Washington.",
      "The Martin-led DNC has succeeded however in raising more money than the national party organization did at this same stage in 2017, and in a recent news release, the DNC shared its finding that \"contributions during the first five months of Chair Martin's leadership are nearly 2:1 dollars raised in the months after the 2016 cycle.\"",
      "\"The DNC is breaking grassroots fundraising records, bringing on more volunteers than ever, and raising record-setting funds to beat Republicans. Democrats are back in the ring thanks to grassroots energy across all 50 states, and together, we're going to defeat the toxic Republican agenda and put this country back on track for hard-working families,\" Martin said in a statement.",
      "But the new round of campaign finance disclosures also underscores the challenges Democrats continue to face this year. Through the first six months of 2025, filings show the DNC taking in a little more than $69 million while the RNC's total receipts were over $96 million.",

    "summary": "A 120-day deadline for Habba's time as interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey expires Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "When Alina Habba was installed by President Trump as acting U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey on March 24, a 120-day stopwatch was immediately triggered.",
      "That's how long an interim U.S. attorney can serve without Senate confirmation, unless the state's district court judges vote in a rare meeting to extend that deadline, which expires Tuesday.",
      "Habba has not received Senate confirmation and faces an uphill battle in a state represented by two Democratic senators adamantly opposed to her holding the office. That leaves it up to the state's judges, who have a decision to make Monday about Habba.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche urged the judges to allow her to remain in the job in a pair of social media posts on Sunday evening and Monday morning.",
      "Habba \"has brought steady leadership and sound judgment as interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey,\" wrote Blanche. \"She has the full confidence of [the president] and DOJ. District judges should use their authority to keep her in place.\"",
      "Habba did not immediately reply to questions from CBS News. She was nominated by Mr. Trump on July 1 for a full term as U.S. attorney.",
      "Blanche led Mr. Trump's personal criminal defense team, and Habba led his personal civil defense team in multiple major cases during the years between his terms in office. Habba had never worked in law enforcement prior to her appointment to the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "Blanche wrote that \"Habba has the full confidence of DOJ leadership because she's doing the job\u2014aggressively, independently, and by the book. The district judges should not be swayed by political noise. Keep her in place.\"",
      "Habba's brief tenure as the top federal law enforcer in her home state has been tumultuous. But she has received permission to hire 20 new prosecutors, according to the New Jersey Globe, a major achievement amid drastic workforce cuts across the federal government.",
      "She has also repeatedly clashed with the state's top Democrats.",
      "The role of a U.S. attorney is traditionally viewed as nonpartisan, but Habba told an interviewer early in her time in office that she aimed to help \"turn New Jersey red,\" referring to the color associated with Republicans. \"I think New Jersey is absolutely close to getting there,\" she told right-wing outlet Real America's Voice. \"So, hopefully while I'm there, I can help that cause.\"",
      "She also announced investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor and attorney general, who oppose the president's immigration measures. In May, Habba's office charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with criminal trespassing and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assault after a protest at an immigration facility.",
      "The charges against Baraka were dropped, and McIver entered a not guilty plea.",

    "summary": "Immigration agents will arrest anyone they find in the country illegally, even if they lack a criminal record, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in an exclusive CBS News interview.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In an exclusive interview with CBS News, the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said his agents will arrest anyone they find in the country illegally, even if they lack a criminal record, while also cracking down on companies hiring unauthorized workers.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said his agency will prioritize its \"limited resources\" on arresting and deporting \"the worst of the worst,\" such as those in the U.S. unlawfully who also have serious criminal histories.",
      "But Lyons said non-criminals living in the U.S. without authorization will also be taken into custody during arrest operations, arguing that states and cities with \"sanctuary\" policies that limit cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement are forcing his agents to go into communities by not turning over noncitizen inmates.",
      "\"What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility,\" Lyons said during his first sit-down network interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention.\"",
      "\"I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing (that) increase\" in so-called \"collateral\" arrests, Lyons added, referring to individuals who are not the original targets of operations but are nonetheless found to be in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "If ICE encounters someone \"that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody,\" Lyons said.",
      "\"We have opened up the whole aperture\"",
      "Collateral arrests by ICE were effectively banned under the Biden administration, which issued rules instructing deportation officers to largely focus on arresting serious criminal offenders, national security threats and migrants who recently entered the U.S. illegally. That policy was reversed immediately after President Trump took office for a second time in January.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's promise to crack down on illegal immigration, his administration has given ICE a broad mandate, with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller pushing the agency to conduct 3,000 daily arrests. While ICE has so far not gotten close to that number, the agency just received tens of billions of dollars in additional funds from Congress to turbo-charge its deportation campaign.",
      "Lyons said \"it's possible\" to meet the administration's target of 1 million deportations in a year with the new infusion of funds. ICE has recorded nearly 150,000 deportations in Mr. Trump's first six months in office, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "From Jan. 1 to June 24, ICE deported around 70,000 people with criminal convictions, but many of the documented infractions were for immigration or traffic offenses, according to data obtained by CBS News.",
      "While the administration frequently highlights arrests of non-citizens convicted of serious crimes like murder and rape, ICE also has sparked backlash in communities across the country due to some of its tactics and actions, including the use of masks by agents (which Lyons said will continue due to concerns about the safety of his officers), arrests of asylum-seekers attending court hearings and raids on worksites.",
      "\"ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst,\" Lyons said. \"One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio.\"",
      "Lyons promises to hold companies accountable",
      "Another major policy at ICE under the second Trump administration is the lifting of a Biden-era pause on large-scale immigration raids at worksites.",
      "In recent weeks, federal immigration authorities have arrested hundreds of suspected unauthorized workers at a meatpacking plant in Nebraska, a horse racetrack in Louisiana and cannabis farms in southern California. At the cannabis farms alone, officials took into custody more than 300 immigrants who were allegedly in the country unlawfully, including 10 minors.",
      "Amid concerns from industry leaders that Mr. Trump's crackdown was hurting their businesses, ICE in June ordered a halt to immigration roundups at farms, hotels and restaurants. But that pause lasted only a matter of days. Since then, the president has talked about giving farmers with workers who are not in the U.S. legally a \"pass,\" though his administration has not provided further details on what that would entail.",
      "In his interview with CBS News, Lyons said ICE would continue worksite immigration enforcement, saying there's no ban on such actions. He said those operations would rely on criminal warrants against employers suspected of hiring unauthorized immigrants, which he said is not a \"victimless crime,\" noting such investigations often expose forced labor or child trafficking.",
      "\"Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life,\" Lyons said.",
      "Asked to confirm that ICE plans to hold those employing immigrants in the U.S. illegally accountable \u2014 and not just arrest the workers themselves \u2014 Lyons said, \"One hundred percent.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Director Lyons, thank you so much for your time.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT TODD LYONS: Oh, appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thanks for coming.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You are leading the agency that is at the center of President Trump's top domestic policy agenda, immigration enforcement and cracking down on illegal immigration. How do you see ICE's role in this administration?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Well, I think, definitely, I see it as a law enforcement tool, right? So ICE is really focused on its public safety mission. I think under all administrations, that what ICE truly is, it's a law enforcement entity. And I really think right now, our main focus is public safety, and that's- that's my focus. The main focus is to keep American people safe and to enact our law enforcement mission.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 The administration has set a goal of carrying out about a million deportations per year annually. Congress just gave your agency $45 billion just to fund its detention network, and also another $30 billion to boost deportation efforts. What exactly will that money fund, and what do we expect that to look on the ground?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 On the ground, what we're really focused on is definitely hiring more in our ranks. In order to achieve the President's mission, and under Secretary Noem's vision, we definitely need more officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 We're looking to hire about 10,000 and- but that's we've been depleted over the past four years. Our ranks have really shrunk, and we really don't have enough to do law enforcement mission. One of the big hampers for us is with the increase in sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies, we have to send more officers and agents out into the community, out on the street. Where we'd only take us two agents, say, going into a secure facility or a police station, county jail to arrest a public safety threat, well, we have to send out four to five agents, and with the increase of assaults on officers, we sometimes have to send out eight to ten just to provide security for those officers that are making the arrest. So that's one of the big things that we're looking forward to with this increased funding is increasing our manpower. Not only just officers, but our attorneys as well, to ensure that we have enough of legal support to go ahead and deal with the Department of Justice, immigration court appeals, things like that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Detention facilities too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Detention facility as well, yeah.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Is the goal of 1 million deportations per year now possible because of this money?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I definitely think it's possible. One thing though, that ICE is historically known for in our mission is we detain to remove, we don't detain punitively. So people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for long-term. We, you know, it's- we detain people to remove them. So what we want to do, too, is focus on the removal efforts as well, because one thing we want to do is remove people in a safe, humane manner, but also efficiently as well, quickly. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by immigration judge. We want to ensure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 You know, I honestly have to say, I think it's just the increased rhetoric that we hear against ICE officers and the ICE mission. If we think back to when you and I did a ride along last year, in October. You know, you and I spent a good amount of time together observing teams in the field, and you didn't see the officers and agents that day masked up, right? You didn't see any kind of violence towards us, any protests. Even going back to January 20, beginning of this administration, up until the middle of February, you really didn't see that kind of rhetoric or violence coming against ICE officers and agents like you do now. I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against the ICE law enforcement mission, is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. And that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taken it to the next level. We've seen protests. We've seen rocks. Rocks, in itself, could be a deadly weapon, but now we have individuals laying in ambush with firearms to attack an ICE facility. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830% increase from last year assaults on officers. That's what really keeps me up at night, is because we have to focus on the men and women of ICE, keeping them safe, making sure they go home to their families, our other partners, as well as the people in the community we interact with. You know, someone might interject themselves into this arrest of someone that's wanted for, say, a murder in their home country, a violent felon who has nothing to lose. And one of these people, agitators or protesters, might get involved in an ICE law enforcement arrest, and they could get injured as well. So there's a lot of factors that really come with this rhetoric against ICE officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks, too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was- recently, people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails--",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: --in the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of- lot of lack of cooperation. So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension, kind of like you said, the immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it. So I think that's also leading to a lot of the, you know, the rhetoric, the criticism, and just a lot more of the increased violence on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 And you have cited those concerns about officer safety when defending your agents wearing masks during operations. That has become a polarizing debate. What do you say, director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves, and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, and that's one of our biggest concerns, and I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it. I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. If you see a lot of the photos, like we were out that day, like I would go back to our ride along. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners in local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vest. You can see the HSI, ERO, federal police officer, FBI on the back of the vest. So I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves. Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do doxx or threaten an ICE officer or agent or their family. I think that's key. If we- if we had that kind of support and had those laws or regulations in place, that we can hold those folks accountable to give ICE agents and officers and other law enforcement officers the peace of mind that someone that does threaten their life or their families or doxxes them will be held accountable. I think that'd go a long way.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 So you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay, what is the policy regarding that? It's not mandatory.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's not mandatory. As you see- I don't know, I wasn't with your ride-along yesterday, but if you see some of the media coverage, there are officers and agents that don't. Recently, there's been some officers that have been interviewed by other networks who- who've talked about the fears and some of the issues with the job. So there are some that don't, but there are some that have been severely doxxed. You know, speaking from experience, last administration I had multiple protesters from antifa show up at my residence. My address has been put out there. My family's information has been put out there. So I know firsthand what these men and women go through, and it's a scary experience for someone's family, because as a law enforcement officer, you don't sign up for that. You don't bring- you don't bring the work home to your job. But when you have folks, or even elected officials saying that there's going to be no rest for an ICE officer, an agent, that we're going to expose them, you know, no rest for their family. That really concerns me.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's get into who ICE is arresting.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Sure.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally, but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, we- we- like I said from the get go, and even, again, going back to when we were together in October, ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio, meaning that if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction or wanted in their home country, and an ICE officer finds other individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well. We are still focused on the worst of the worst. More than half the individuals we have in custody right now have either a conviction or pending criminal charges, since they're released from a sanctuary jurisdiction. One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records aren't in U.S. data systems. So when we do go out and say, arrest someone that has an Interpol Red Notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal, but under the American judicial state, they don't have an American criminal history, but that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country. I think that's one of the statistic that kind of gets lost in someone and they say, well, this person is non criminal- he doesn't have a criminal history in the United States. Well, that individual can have a criminal history, say, in Brazil, Uruguay, Ukraine, Russia. So there's a lot too that goes into that, what ICE offices and agents do arrest people for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And you're saying that now, if your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: They're so-called collateral arrests.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay. We just, as you mentioned, rode along with Border- not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worst of the worst who are in the country illegally. But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases, farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally, but also are violent offenders?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes, that's one thing, and that's one thing I'm extremely focused on since I became the acting director, is the fact that the president and Secretary Noem have made a promise to the American public that ICE is going to focus on the worst of the worst, and that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start. What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say, that- that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody. In regards to the work site, like you mentioned, one thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6 in LA, is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you- we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally and that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: 100%.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It is- it is. I can definitely see that concern, but what I would say is that we have to hold these American businesses accountable, especially when it comes to human trafficking, or child trafficking, forced labor, because those are victims, right? That, you know, that's where illegal employment isn't just a victimless crime, it's a victim at the end of that being exploited. And these American companies do exploit individuals who come here illegally just to make an extra dollar, and that's just not right. We have to hold those county- companies accountable.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Should anyone here illegally now be scared of ICE agents potentially arresting them? Should that be something that they should be worried about?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No- I- what I can- I can speak for with ICE is, we've always done targeted enforcement. That's one thing I- I always stress. You saw it when you- when you and I rode together in Baltimore last year. ICE knows who they're going after that day. There are other DHS entities, Border Patrol has a different mission, CBP has a different mission than us. I can't speak to them, but I will speak to ICE, and the fact that, when ICE does go out, the person we're looking for, it- has a criminal record, has been released from a jail, that's considered a public safety threat, or has been ordered lawfully removed from the United States by an immigration judge. That's another one of our big things as well. But again, to go back to my point earlier, if we do go out--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Who may not be criminals, but have been ordered deported.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah. Ordered deported. There are millions of people that are here in the United States that have had their due process, went through the entire immigration process, and have been lawfully ordered deported by a Department of Justice immigration judge, and have just not left the country. We are focused on them as well. But again, to go back to what I said earlier, if we go ahead and go out into the community, and we do effectuate an arrest of one of those individuals, but there might be two or three other individuals with that person that's here illegally, we're just not going to walk away like we did in the past. We are going to, you know, conduct our law enforcement mission and arrest those individuals.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: I want to read you, Director, a letter that Congressman Tony Gonzales and other Republicans wrote to you, actually. They said, \"every minute that we spend pursuing an individual with a clean record is a minute less that we dedicate on apprehending terrorists or cartel operatives.\" Isn't that just objectively true from an operational standpoint, because you don't have the agents and facilities, perhaps, to detain everyone who is here illegally?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I would say that. Operationally, I've always said we do have limited resources. Now we are going to get that funding with the president's Big Beautiful Bill. To the congressman, I would say that ICE is still focused on going after terrorists. We've- we've- you know, arrested over 3,000 TDA gang members, which is now a foreign terrorist organization. But much- what I would say is, much like any local law enforcement agency, if you pull somebody over in a vehicle, and that person has a misdemeanor warrant, say, or a civil warrant, that local law enforcement agency isn't going to walk away from that individual. They're going to arrest that individual. And it's the same with ICE. So while we still are going out after the rapists, murderers, terrorists, we are going to encounter individuals that are here illegally. But what I can promise is, our main focus is those public safety threats, are those national security concerns, because that's what ICE's mission is. Now we are going to encounter those other people which are listed as collaterals, but we just can't walk away from them. We need to do our law enforcement mission as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You're not ignoring those cases anymore.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: On worksite enforcement, there have been some mixed messages, if you will, from the administration. Initially, there was an effective pause on arrests at hotels, restaurants, and farms. That was quickly reversed. The president has talked about, Director, giving a pass to farmers who are in the country with workers who are here illegally. What is the policy now, when it comes to immigration worksite enforcement?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Which is- kind of what I said earlier in the interview, is the fact that work- when we do a worksite enforcement, it's based on a criminal case. So ICE is still going to focus on a criminal case, whether that be, like you saw on the marijuana grow farm in California, whether it be suspected human trafficking or child forced labor, issues like that. So our policy is still, if we're going to worksite enforcement, we are focused on that criminal aspect of the investigation. So that's what ICE's policy is. I can't speak to the administration. I don't want to get ahead of the president or secretary when it comes to any type of long term immigration plan they do have for the workers, but I will say for ICE, our policy is, we're still going to build solid criminal cases on those worksites to include the businesses, and that's what we're focused on.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Including farms, hotels and restaurants?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, we have seen, in many instances, where certain organizations do exploit labor like that, whether it be child labor, human trafficking, things like that. We can't walk away from a criminal case when it comes to real victims there, we'll still focus on those. Now administratively, I- we're gonna focus more heavily on the criminal side of that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: But there's no ban on enforcement operations at certain work sites?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No. And I think, like I said, you'll see, when we show up at a work site, it's because a signed federal judge warrant has brought us there for a criminal reason.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Like in the case of the cannabis farms in California?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller, who plays a major role on immigration policy in this administration, has talked about ICE carrying out at least 3,000 daily arrests. Right now, you are not hitting that number. Is that target realistic? And can you get to it just by apprehending criminals?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I- if you look at the amount of criminals that we've already arrested, I think you see we can. I think when you look at those larger numbers, when people talk about those certain goals, you have to also look at those individuals that do have those final orders of removals. Those are what we're really focused on as well. There was many people that were let in the last administration that have gone through their immigration process, who have not shown up for immigration court and have been ordered deported. We still have to focus on those. So I would still say that you're going to see what ICE resources going out daily will be still those criminal cases and those final orders.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Can you get to that 3,000 number per day?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think operationally, we can get to any number we set our- set our mind on. I think we just need to be limited in our scope, and use our limited resources to focus on the worst of the worst. I- you know, operationally, when we're trying to protect the American public, I can't be focused on a number. We have to be focused on, number one, getting those public safety threats and those national security threats out of the country, like we did just recently, when we arrested some of those Iranians. There were potential, known, suspected terrorists that came in on the last administration. And we also had to worry about the safety of the men and women of ICE as well. Those are the two main focus that I need to focus on, on our daily operations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know what the current daily arrest average is right now?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I wouldn't say this daily arrest average. It just really depends on size and scope of what we're doing nationwide. It can go anywhere from 2,500 to 1,700 a day.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Got it, okay. Our colleague Margaret Brennan recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violence offenses. For example, fewer than 1% had homicide convictions. What do you make of that data?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: What I make of that is the fact that we can't look at it just based on the violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that has just been arrested, say, for DUI. Well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone that's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the larger scale of what specific crimes are. You know, whether it's a rape, a homicide, of course, you want to get those worst of the worst. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community, into here illegally, we need to focus on that. So what I focus on is ensuring that those individuals that have committed a crime are the first ones we're focused on, and that's who we are going to remove.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you know, Director, the Supreme Court recently allowed third-country deportations to continue. Should we expect those deportations to increase in the near future? And are other countries, additional nations, now stepping up and saying, I will take back people who are not my citizens?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, I would say you'd see that. But what I'd go back to is the fact that safe third-country removals has been a part of the Immigration Nationality Act for decades. This isn't something that's new, ICE has always done this, so obviously it's come to the forefront now, because, as we talked about earlier, immigration enforcement is at the forefront of the President's administration. But this has been part of the Immigration Nationality Act, which has been enacted by Congress for decades. So we've been doing this for years. That's been part of one of ICE's tools to remove individuals from these recalcitrant countries that just won't take anyone back. Prime example, if we had a country that won't take a homicide suspect back, and under the Supreme Court ruling of Zadvydas, we don't hold punitively, so we can only hold someone for six months to effectuate their removal. If their country won't take them back, we have to release this rapist and murderer back into the community. What Congress did under the Immigration Nationality Act, when enacting the Safe Third Country Agreement, gives us an option to remove these offenders back to a country that will take them.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you will continue those deportations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: We will continue those deportations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: To countries like South Sudan, for example.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Does it make sense to send people to countries where they have no ties, though? Even if they are convicted criminals.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, I would say, is I- my main focus, like I said, is the safety and security in the United States. Why would we let child rapists with a propensity of violence back into the community, because their home nation won't take them, when they're not here lawfully, or they have no right to stay here. That's our focus. Is to make sure that we are removing these individuals from the country in the most effective and meaningful way that we can. And if their home country won't take them back, then we need to seek other options, other than letting them just roam in the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: The Associated Press, director, just reported that ICE now has access to the personal information of millions of people enrolled in Medicaid, including names and addresses. Can you confirm that that is true? And if so, what does ICE plan to do with that information?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: You know, one thing that we have seen is the fact that under the last administration, we have so many known got-aways, or individuals that came into the United States and just totally disappeared off the grid. What ICE is doing is working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for, whether it be data from the Department of Labor, data from health and service- Health and Human Services, Medicaid, we are using that data to try to locate, again, the worst of the worst, those people that have been lawfully deported. So I think that's what you're going to see that data used for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 To identify and arrest people who are here illegally.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's talk about Alligator Alcatraz. Florida just opened a facility, as you know, in the Everglades, that is holding people awaiting deportation because they're here illegally. Some of them have committed crimes. How much of that facility is designed to help you operationally versus to send the message? That message being, if you're here illegally, you could potentially be sent to this scary-sounding place like Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's more of an operational. State of Florida had partnered with us for that. We had limited, we had limited space in Florida, obviously. What I would say is that we don't have the detention space capacity to remove people. Partnering with states like this definitely does help us. It is an operational need for us, is to have those partnerships with states, especially a state like Florida that does have the 287(g) agreement, where their local, State and County deputies are deputized to be ICE officers who are encountering these individuals. That definitely helps us in the- in the mission of removing individuals from the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you underscore, there have been some growing tensions in some communities because of ICE enforcement actions. Do you think there's any way, Director, to de-escalate the situation, and can you carry out the mass deportation operation that the President has promised without losing the trust of many in the public?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think one of the main things for us is that open line of communication, interviews like this, actually people looking at what ICE is doing, us highlighting these criminal offenders that we are arresting. I think a key thing too, is working with elected officials to come to common ground, to really focus on the safety of neighborhoods and communities, and really focus on what ICE does in their law enforcement mission, and totally take out the rhetoric of what's being said right now, and just really focus on that ICE is a viable law enforcement partner that does a significant public safety mission for the United States. I think that's very key in keeping these open line of communications, and working with local and state government- governments and elected officials to ensure that we are removing these public safety threats from their communities.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Director, is there something I didn't ask you that you wanted to underscore?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No, I just really liked- appreciate you taking the time to come here, and let me highlight exactly what the ICE mission is. And I just appreciate the opportunity to have that conversation.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: All right. Thank you, Director.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Appreciate it, thanks.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 19:44:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Republicans and MAGA remain solidly behind Trump.",
    "story": [
      "After six months that included a string of achievements on President Trump's legislative goals, views of his second term are increasingly defined by the difference between his political base, which likes what it sees, and the rest of the country, which has growing doubt.",
      "On the economic front, it comes from continued calls to focus more on prices, rather than tariffs, which most Americans oppose. And now, there's the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which at least initially, most believe will help the wealthy.",
      "On matters of deportation, differences hinge on who, and how many, Americans see as being targeted, as well as the use of detention facilities. Here again, the Republican and MAGA political base remain overwhelmingly approving of it all, but the rest of the American public has become less so.",
      "(On another matter, by comparison, most say the case of Jeffrey Epstein is not very important in their evaluations of the president, and in particular, the president's MAGA base remains overwhelmingly approving of his job performance, especially on immigration.)",
      "Most now say the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals for deportation and also is deporting more people than they thought it would.",
      "The program had majority support earlier in the term, but today it does not, moving along with that perception of who is being deported.",
      "Meanwhile, most disapprove of the way the administration is using detention facilities.",
      "Approval of the deportation program has slipped over these months to become slightly net-negative now, with support becoming more exclusively drawn from Republicans and MAGA identifiers.",
      "Hispanic Americans, along with Americans overall, say Hispanic people are being targeted more than others for searches, and those who think so say that's unfair.",
      "As a result, Hispanic approval of the deportation program and of Mr. Trump more generally is lower today than it was earlier in the term. (For broader context, too, during the 2024 election, Mr. Trump made gains with Hispanic voters and started his term with approval from half of Hispanics. Today he has one-third.)",
      "This, despite widespread public views that Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings.",
      "That suggests that Mr. Trump's declining marks on immigration generally are more connected to his deportation program than activity at the border, these days.",
      "And on balance, it's an example of how a policy pendulum can swing in American politics: in the first year of Joe Biden's presidency, most Americans said he and Democrats were not being tough enough on immigration. Today, most Americans say Mr. Trump and the Republicans are being too tough.",
      "Half the country (again, largely outside that political base) now says the president is focusing too much on deportation.",
      "Economics, tariffs and \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\"",
      "What do people want Mr. Trump to focus on? That part isn't news: it's still prices, as it's been throughout the term. Seven in 10 say the administration isn't doing enough to try to lower them.",
      "Inflation and prices are important to most in how they evaluate Mr. Trump overall.",
      "Nearly two-thirds now disapprove of how Mr. Trump is handling inflation, the highest disapproval for him on that yet.",
      "And for the first time, a plurality says the administration is focusing too much on cutting spending.",
      "More broadly, and after having campaigned heavily on immigration and inflation, most Americans still say Mr. Trump is doing what he promised in the campaign. However, fewer say that now than did near the beginning of his term, with the difference being in part, fewer independents and fewer Democrats thinking so. Republicans largely say it's consistent.",
      "On the debate, such as it is, around interest rates, Americans are split in their general desire for the economy \u2014 whether the bigger priority should be to keep interest rates where they are to control inflation, or lower them to make borrowing money easier.",
      "Amid the discussion surrounding Mr. Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a large majority say the Fed should act independently from the president.",
      "But there's a caveat to all this, as many admit they don't know a lot about what the Fed does.",
      "Powell gets mixed confidence, with Democrats expressing more confidence in him than Republicans, perhaps another example of how partisanship may stand in for more technical economic viewpoints.",
      "Six in 10 disapprove of the One Big Beautiful Bill legislation. Views of it today are similar to what they were before the bill was passed: Most think it will hurt poor people and help the wealthy. Fewer believe it will help the middle or working class.",
      "With so many Americans saying they don't know a lot of the bill's specifics, the initial response to it appears very partisan, opening up what may be a months-long fight to define and sell it.",
      "And so Mr. Trump's overall approval also continues to slide as it has consistently, if incrementally, since the start of his term. It's now closer to where it spent a lot of time in his first term, in the low 40s, with similar structure underneath of negative sentiment beyond that strong approval from the base.",
      "Most MAGA back Trump on Epstein matter",
      "For all the week's punditry, the matter over the Epstein files isn't affecting Mr. Trump's overall approval among his MAGA base. For one thing, Republicans and MAGA like his handling of immigration, especially, and say they gauge him on that more.",
      "The Epstein case doesn't compare on importance. Few Republicans, including MAGA, say issues surrounding the Epstein case matter \"a lot\" to how they evaluate Mr. Trump's presidency.",
      "That said, there is some relative dissatisfaction within the GOP, including in the MAGA base, with how the administration is handling it.",
      "Americans do want the files released \u2014 that includes Democrats, Republicans, MAGA in particular, across a wide range of groups.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly suspect that the files contain damaging information about powerful and wealthy people.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,343 U.S. adults interviewed between July 16-18, 2025.

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin with a new CBS poll. Six months into President Trump's second administration, 42 percent of Americans approve of the job he's doing as president, down three points from a month ago, and down even more from February, when a majority approved of his job performance.",
      "For a closer look at the numbers, we're joined by elections and surveys, executive director Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, good to have you here.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the two big issues the president ran on, immigration and the economy, why have his approval ratings ticked down?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, let me start with immigration, because you're right, that is a big reason he won, deportation, in particular.",
      "The deportation program started with majority approval. And since then, it's declined gradually and then a little more over the last month. But the reason for why it has is pretty compelling, and that is a majority now says they think the administration is trying to deport more people than they'd expected it to.",
      "And then it's the who. They no longer \u2013 a majority no longer thinks that the administration is just trying to prioritize dangerous criminals, that that has expanded. And when they think those things, they're less approving of it overall.",
      "So, another component of this too, which is that you get a majority who doesn't approve of the way in which the administration is using the detention centers as well. So all of that is in the mix. The other part of this, though, is that Donald Trump's handling of immigration more broadly is also down.",
      "And that's happening at the same time that Americans say, because they are, that border crossings have gone down. So, within that gauge on immigration, you see how much the deportation program is really driving things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we have seen and CBS obtained data that the number one issue in terms of convictions for traffic violations and then immigration.",
      "You looked in your polling at the supporters of the president. How are they feeling?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Very, very strongly behind him and especially on this immigration issue and especially on deportation.",
      "And that's an important point, right? His base is still with him. What you see in this dynamic is increasingly a base that really likes what it sees and everybody else with growing doubts. The other part of this is, on the deportation program in particular, we have seen declines among Hispanic Americans, and here again, the why.",
      "Hispanic Americans and Americans overall believe that they, Hispanics, are being targeted or sought after for more searches for deportation compared to other groups. Earlier in the president's term, he had much more overall approval from Hispanics. He had made gains during the election, people will recall, importantly among Hispanics, and now that has fallen off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president just had this big legislative win with the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. This was tax. This was spending. A lot of these changes haven't taken hold yet. But what is the perception of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So let's benchmark this. He's got majority disapproval on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: And the why there is, and this is at least initially, as we say, it's that more people think that it will help the wealthy and not help them in particular.",
      "And here we get into focus, because people say the administration is not focused enough on lowering prices and is focused too much on tariffs, which a majority opposes. It's a \u2013 here, there's that juxtaposition of what they expected, what they want to focus on, and what they see as being focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has been talking about firing the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. We know the Supreme Court said back in May, they signaled here, he doesn't really have the authority to do it without cause.",
      "But we know the Fed's job is to manage employment, manage price stability, and they're supposed to be politically independent, so that there is an interference with the economy. Have you ever polled before on whether there should be \u2013 that the president should really be able to do this?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: We haven't. Most people say they think the Fed should act independently from the president's guidance.",
      "But on that larger point about the way institutions work, we have sometimes asked questions in this administration about things like, who should have the power of the purse? Who should have the final say on spending? We have asked about things like pushing back against judges who rule against the administration.",
      "All of these things, for context, are new. Now, this obviously isn't the first president to try to expand executive power. And that has a long history in politics and in polling. But some of these institutional arrangements and public views of them are certainly new for us here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a reason to ask, in other words.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's fascinating.",

      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard in our polling some of the perceptions of the economy; 61 percent of Americans believe the administration is putting too much focus on tariffs; 70 percent say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices. And 60 percent oppose new tariffs on imported goods.",
      "This is a centerpiece to your policy plan. How do you reverse public opposition?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, they're going to love the deals that President Trump and I are doing. I mean, they're just going to love them.",
      "The president figured out the right answer and sent letters to these countries, said, this is going to fix the trade deficit. This will go a long way to fixing the trade deficit. And that's gotten these countries to the table. And they're going to open their markets, or they're going to pay the tariff.",
      "And if they open their markets, the opportunity for Americans to export, to grow their business, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, this is going to be \u2013 the next two weeks are going to be weeks for the record books. President Trump is going to deliver for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Next two weeks for the record books, because you have that August 1 deadline.",
      "But President Trump sent letters to most of the major trading partners announcing higher tariff rates effective August 1. That could hit countries accounting for three-quarters of U.S. imports. Let's talk about Canada, one of the big ones. Their prime minister said this past week there's not a lot of evidence they can get a trade deal with the U.S. that avoids tariffs.",
      "Is your message to Canada, Mr. Secretary, that no matter what they offer at the negotiating table, free trade is gone, there will be a tariff in place?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, see, that's silly.",
      "We have a plan called USMCA, U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. Virtually 75 percent of all goods coming from Mexico and Canada already come in tariff- free. The president said, look, unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border, we're just going to keep tariffs on the other 25 percent. And that's what he has on.",
      "So don't be confused about it. The president understands that we need to open the markets. Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the president has. It's fair trade. It's reciprocal trade.",
      "Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed? This is an 80-year wrong that President Trump is trying to fix. And our businesses are going to really, really enjoy it. I think the president's going to open between $300 billion and $400 billion of opportunity for Americans.",
      "That's 1.5 percent \u2013 up to 1.5 percent GDP growth because the president's going to open all these markets up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: You saw it with Vietnam. You saw it with Indonesia. You're going to watch all these other countries decide, if they want to do business with America, let's just open our market up to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: That's opportunity that President Trump is bringing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw framework announcements with those countries you just mentioned.",
      "But back on what the Canadian prime minister, the man you're negotiating with, said, he's assuming there's going to be a tariff here. There's already this baseline 10 percent tariff that we are seeing from the administration. Is that set in stone or is it going to go to like 15 or 20 percent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, I think what you have got is, you should assume that the small countries, the Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa, they will have a baseline tariff of 10 percent.",
      "And then the bigger economies will either open themselves up or they will pay a fair tariff to America for not opening themselves up and treating America unfairly. So what the president's view is and what he's instructed me to do is say, look, if you're willing to open yourself up and really open your economy to American business to ranchers, fishermen, farmers and businesses, then, of course, we will make a better deal with you.",
      "But if you're going to keep your tariffs and your tariff barriers holding us down, then, of course, it seems fair that you should pay a tariff to do business with the greatest customer on Earth, the American consumer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so just quickly, are you going to renegotiate that free trade deal the USMCA?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: But that's a year from today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Today, of course, 75 percent comes in free.",
      "But, of course, should you expect us to renegotiate it? It makes perfect sense for the president to renegotiate it. He wants to protect American jobs. He doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico, when they could be built in Michigan or \u2013 and Ohio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: It's just better for American workers. The president's got the American workers' back. That's why they elected him. That's why the stock market's at all-time highs. They understand the president actually understands business and is doing it the right way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, OK, let me ask you about Europe.",
      "Boeing airplanes, Kentucky bourbon, these are some of the things that the Europeans are looking to target if we get into a trade war as retaliation by them.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We're not \u2013 they're not going to do it. They're just not going to do it. We are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just met with the European trade negotiator. He came out kind of downbeat. You disagree? You think we are going to get a deal with the European Union?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I was on the phone with the European trade negotiators this morning about a half-hour ago. So there's plenty of room.",
      "Look, the president and the European Union, these are the two biggest trading partners in the world talking to each other. We will get a deal done. I am confident we will get a deal done, OK? And it will be great for America because the president has the back of America.",
      "So I think all these key countries will figure out it is better to open their markets to the United States of America than to pay a significant tariff. And Donald Trump has made that point clear. No one has protected America the way Donald Trump has protected America. It is so fun to work for him, because I have him behind me saying the right things for America.",
      "And I get to do those negotiations with all these countries. And you are going to see the best set of trade deals you have ever seen for America and for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that August 1 deadline with the E.U. a hard deadline? Are you going to get a deal, since you were just on the phone?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I can't hear anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you \u2013 can you hear me, Mr. Secretary? It looks like your shot just froze up on my end.",
      "It looks like our remote shot with the secretary is frozen, so we're going to take a commercial break, try to fix it and try to finish a conversation on the other side of this.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, an update on an important story.",
      "The Hamas-ran Gaza Health Ministry says at least 67 people were killed while waiting for aid from United Nations trucks today. Our CBS Gaza team spoke with eyewitnesses who say that Israeli tanks were behind the hills and, as thousands of people searching for food approached, the tanks opened fire. The IDF tells us that the troops did so to remove \u2013 quote \u2013 \"an immediate threat\" in the area and that the reported number of deaths does not match their initial review.",
      "We will continue to track that as we track the hopes for a hostage deal and cease-fire.",
      "But, right now, we want to go back to the commerce secretary, who I believe can hear me now?",
      "Mr. Secretary?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I can hear you now. Yes, I can hear you now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. All right.",
      "But to pick up where we left off before the technical issues, August 1, is it a hard deadline with the E.U. or is that going to slide?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, no, that's a hard deadline.",
      "So, on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in. But nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on August 1. Now, remember, the world is paying 10 percent right now, and China's paying 30 percent. So that's right now. And that's why we're running at about plus-$30 billion a month for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: You got to remember, this is going to pay off our deficit. This is going to make America stronger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We are finally protecting America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have that income if you keep them in place. But if you're negotiating them away, then they won't be there. So that is contradictory to me.",
      "But I want\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Nothing \u2013 nothing is getting \u2013 no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not negotiating the tariffs away?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Nothing is getting negotiated away. We have a 10 percent on the world.",
      "No, no, 10 percent is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher, like Vietnam and Indonesia, right? They're 19 and 20 percent. Most countries will pay higher. The small countries are likely to be 10 percent, but the bigger countries are likely to pay higher. That's just the way it's going to be because we can't have these \u2013 $1 trillion trade deficit.",
      "It's just wrong for America and Donald Trump is going to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American corporations are just going to swallow that and not pass that price increase on to consumers? What is your projection?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: What, what's so interesting is that you're worried about the importers. How about the people who build and employ Americans\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking about people who go to the store to buy.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 people who make cars here, people who manufacture here? They don't pay a tariff. They don't pay a tariff at all.",
      "So President Trump says it all the time. Build in America, you don't pay a tariff. The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think it's just a wrong way of thinking about it. Americans deserve to be employed here and have the best jobs in the world. And that's what Donald Trump is trying to deliver.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking you about consumer prices, what people will pay when they go to the store.",
      "But in \u2013 since you don't want to answer\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, I think they will be low. I think they will be low, shockingly low.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Seriously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Consumer Price Index doesn't currently reflect that, though, that the trend is towards higher.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, it just went up. What did it go up, a tenth-of-a-percent?",
      "Look, the dollar has declined\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two-tenths on the core.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 more than 10 percent, right? So the dollar declining sort of softens tariffs completely. These are small numbers. You're going to see inflation is not going to change.",
      "Remember, inflation is an expectation of rates continuing to grow. Tariffs are just going to reset the price level for imports, for certain imports from certain countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: But everybody is building in America. And, remember, Donald Trump announced over $11 trillion of building in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All that building in America, the construction jobs here, but then, when those products come on the shelves, they come on much cheaper. Energy is cheaper. I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is.",
      "And Jerome Powell, who's held these rates up way too high, way too high, you're going to see him cut rates. The Fed's going to cut rates. Mortgages are going to be cheaper. And America's going to be so much better off under Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are reports that the treasury secretary has talked the president out of his threat to fire the Fed chair, since the Fed's already expected on a consensus basis to be lowering rates.",
      "Are you telling us tonight \u2013 or today that he's not under threat, that he will keep his job?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The president is an amazingly transparent person. When he thinks something, he says it.",
      "So he says, look, this guy's doing the worst job. We have interest rates the same as Gabon. Europe, all of Europe, the 27 countries of Europe, they're in the 2's, and we're in the 4's. That means your mortgage, everybody who is watching, their mortgage is two points higher than it should be.",
      "So the Fed should be cutting rates. And Donald Trump's going to try to figure out how to get there\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they're projected to.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Whether he decides \u2013 but whether he decides to let Jerome Powell stay in the job or not, I will leave that to Donald Trump.",
      "I think the guy's doing the worst job. He's costing us, you and me and the American people, more than $500 billion. I think he's costing us $700 billion a year by keeping rates too high. It's just wrong. I don't know why he's torturing America this way. Our rates should be lower.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't unilaterally set those rates.",
      "But we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us and sticking through the technical \u2013 technical issues we had.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes. He joins us from Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman. You are on the Financial Services Committee, so let's pick up right there.",
      "The Supreme Court indicated the president of the United States does not have the authority to fire the Fed chair unless there is cause. It sounds like the White House is trying to build a case that they have cause. If they go ahead with it, what happens?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Yes.",
      "Well, you know, Margaret, the last question you asked the secretary shows what a con man he is. And I just listened to his whole thing. And if you're over the age of 5, you have dealt with hucksters and con men. Everything's going to be great in two weeks. By August 1, we're going to have a deal. The American people are going to be so happy.",
      "Complete failure to understand the facts, right? He said that tariffs are paid by foreign countries. Tariffs are not paid by foreign countries. He said Jay Powell is torturing the American people.",
      "Margaret, you didn't have the time, but if you had had a minute, you would have said, wait a minute. There's a Federal Open Market Committee that is comprised of seven Fed governors and all of the heads of the Central Bank offices around the country. That committee, comprised of people who have been appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, set the interest rates, right?",
      "So this notion that Jay Powell is unilaterally stopping a decline in interest rates, which, by the way, in the face of \u2013 in the face \u2013 for those of \u2013 those folks who know a little bit about economics, in the face of upticking inflation, which we're seeing, would be absolutely bananas.",
      "So what you just saw was a master class by a huckster and a con man who uses words like torture that are very, very dangerous words, not just for the economy, but for the physical safety of people like Jay Powell.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just to be clear, that's why I said it's not the chairman's unilateral decision, for exactly the reason you raised, that there is a committee that makes the decision.",
      "The inflation rate for the CPI was 2.7 percent. If you strip out food \u2013 energy and food, which is more volatile, it is up two-tenths of a percent, so the economic data is what we are pointing to there, not opinion on pricing.",
      "But is there congressional pushback that can be done? I mean, what happens if there's a tweet that says the Fed chair is gone?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, interestingly, inside the White House \u2013 and I don't know who it is \u2013 my guess is, it's maybe the treasury secretary \u2013 is saying \u2013 and this is a very difficult thing to say to a person like Donald Trump \u2013 that, if you fire the Fed chair, either illegally, which they're happy to do, or because you trump up some baloney- like charge associated with a renovation of the headquarters, there is going to be a massive market reaction, because you cannot lie to the capital markets.",
      "We saw this the day after Liberation Day, before we all were familiarized with the TACO trade. The day after Liberation Day, the stock and the bond markets took a nosedive. So my guess is that somebody saying to the president, because he doesn't care if he follows the law or not \u2013 and the law is very clear that he can't fire the Fed chair \u2013 but somebody is saying to the president, the economic instability that gets caused when the cornerstone of the global economy and capital markets all of a sudden has a politically driven interest rate policy\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 I think that's the one thing that's holding them off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, we're going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on a variety of topics we need to bring up with you on the other side with \u2013 of it.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're looking for more Face the Nation, including extended interviews and special content, you can subscribe to our podcast. It's available on all platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Amazon.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with Congressman Jim Himes and an exclusive interview with the acting ICE director, Todd Lyons.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We are continuing our conversation now with Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "Congressman, I want to pick up on that topic.",
      "Just a statement of fact here. A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found that the U.S. intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election was correct, they deemed it to be so on a bipartisan basis. I'm saying that because today, and yesterday, the director of the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, has said that she is referring for prosecution former American officials she accused of treasonist conspiracy, a year's long coo against President Trump because they assessed Russia had tried to influence the election. This is weeks after the CIA director issued a report critiquing the tradecraft that went into that 2016 assessment.",
      "Is there any legal basis for any kind of prosecution here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): None. Absolutely none, Margaret. What you saw from the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie. Because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody's going to get hurt.",
      "Now, you pointed out that the Senate committee, then led by Marco Rubio, a Republican and now secretary of state, found unanimously that Russia medaled in the election to try to assist Donald Trump. John Durham, special council appointed by Donald Trump, investigated this, fund that the Senate report was correct.",
      "Now, what Tulsi is doing, it's a little slight of hand but it's worth focusing on. She is saying that the Intelligence Committee early on said that the Russians could not use cyber tools to mess with the voting infrastructure, the machines that tally our votes. That was true then and it is true now. Though the Russians tried to break into a couple of states', you know, election technical infrastructure, they didn't do it. But it is well known and well established that the Russians hacked into the DNC and undertook any number of influence operations, including buying reams of Facebook ads, to discredit Hillary Clinton. That is not in contention, right?",
      "And what is horrifying about this whole lie out of Gabbard is, number one, it puts people at risk. And right now, you know, the mouth breathers on MAGA online are just going out of their minds based on a lie. And, number two, the intelligence community is full of very, very good people who do their jobs every single day and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest and it is a really, really bad thing for the safety and security of the American people when that dynamic is \u2013 is \u2013 is out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Senate report is online. The findings are \u2013 are there. But I understand your distinction there. It's an important one in influence verses physical hacking.",
      "You are \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But, by the way, Margaret, if I may.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: If I may. You asked about the referral.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Here's the test. This is Epstein all over again. Criminal referrals. We're going to prosecute Barack Obama. You know, treasonist and seditious. Here's the thing. And I hope that four, five, six weeks from now. Don't take it from this Democrat. Four or five, six weeks from now, let's see if this administration, Tulsi Gabbard accusing a former president of treason, let's see if they bring charges. They won't. They won't, because there's not a judge in the land, not a single judge, who will treat this with anything other than laughter that will be heard from the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country.",
      "So, the test of this is, four, five, six weeks from now, is the DOJ bringing charges.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And the answer to that is no. And now we're going to be in Epstein world. We're like, wait a minute, treasonist conspiracy by a former president. Why isn't the Department of Justice bringing charges? And the answer to that question is that it is a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "On the other topic I want to ask you about, as a Democrat, \"The New York Times,\" the DNC \u2013 is reporting the DNC's examination of what went wrong in the last election is going to steer clear the decisions made by the Biden turned Harris campaign.",
      "You were very direct early on in calling for then President Biden to drop out of this race. You don't parse your words normally. Do you actually think it is possible for your party to self-diagnose problems without looking at the presidential race itself in terms of the candidates?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, we \u2013 we \u2013 we need to acknowledge, and every \u2013 and all of America saw it on the night of the disastrous debate in the July before the election, that Joe Biden was not going to win the election. That was not just evident in the debate, it was evident in the polling that his people were keeping from him. OK, so that is a fact.",
      "Now, Democrats are a big tent party. We go from Joe Manchin, who's practically a Republican, to AOC, we is a Democratic socialist. So, we always have a struggle in coming up with sort of one set of policies, one set of messaging. And it's particularly hard to do when we don't have a presidential candidate. You know, a presidential candidate, of course, attracts the attention, is sort of the one person who must run nationwide and speak for the party as a whole. Right now we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of different views. And I understand that's enormously frustrating to Democrats who are so upset over the result of the election.",
      "But, you know, other than fight back with the tools that we have right now, we've got to be introspective about what we have done wrong that resulted in a dramatic win by Donald Trump in 2020.*",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's an awful lot of rage in the Democratic Party. And my message to my Democratic friends is, fine, I get the rage, believe me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I was in the chamber on January 6, 2021, and worried for my own life. But the thing to do right now is to be introspective and ask yourself \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: What can we do better to appeal to more people, including those people that we have lost time and time again in elections?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Fifteen months out from the mid-term races.",
      "Congressman Jim Himes, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mass deportation was one of President Trump's biggest campaign promises. Six months into his administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported nearly 150,000 people thus far.",
      "And with the recent passage of Trump's tax and border bill, the agency will be getting an unprecedented infusion of funds, becoming the highest funded law enforcement agency in this country.",
      "Our immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez spoke with the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, this Friday. And he began by asking whether the new money will help the administration meet its goal of one million deportations per year.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "TODD LYONS (Acting Director, ICE): I definitely think it's possible. One thing, though, that ICE is historically known for our mission is, we detain to remove. We don't detain punitively. So, people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for the long term. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by an immigration judge. We want to insure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "TODD LYONS: I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against ICE law enforcement mission is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. In that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taking it to the next level. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830 percent increase from last year assaults on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks too.",
      "TODD LYONS: I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was \u2013 recently people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would \u2013",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails.",
      "TODD LYONS: In the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of \u2013 a lot of lack of cooperation. So, you are seeing us out more.",
      "And I think there is more attention. Kind of like you said, the immigration missions, one of the forefront of this administration. So, there is a lot of scrutiny and \u2013 and publicity to it.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What do you say, Director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents?",
      "TODD LYONS: Yes, and that's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE t hat keep themselves and their families safe, then I will allow it.",
      "I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners and local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vests. You can see the HIS, ERO, federal police officer, FBI, on the back of the vest. So, I \u2013 I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves.",
      "Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do docks (ph) or threat an ICE officer or agent or their family.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations?",
      "TODD LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "TODD LYONS: ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is, under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio. Meaning that, if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction, are wanted in their home country, and you \u2013 an ICE officer finds others individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well.",
      "One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records are in U.S. data systems. So, when we do go out and, say, arrest someone that has an Interpol red notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal. But under the American judicial standard (ph), they don't have an American criminal history. But that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: If your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "TODD LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will. I \u2013",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Those so-called \"collateral arrests.\"",
      "TODD LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We just, as you mentioned, rode along with border \u2013 not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worse of the worse who are in the country illegally.",
      "But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally but also are violent offenders?",
      "TODD LYONS: Yes, ICE Is going to focus on the worst of the worst. And that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start.",
      "What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency, already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody. But we \u2013 we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests. And that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody.",
      "In regards to the work site, like you mentioned. One thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6th in L.A., is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you \u2013 we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers. These people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally. And that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers?",
      "TODD LYONS: One hundred percent.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "TODD LYONS: It is.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Our colleague, Margaret Brennan, recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violent offenses. For example, fewer than 1 percent had homicide convictions. What do you make of the data?",
      "TODD LYONS: We can't look at it just based on violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that's just been arrested, say for DUI, well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone who's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the largest scale of what a specific crimes are \u2013 are. you know, whether it's a rape, a homicide. Of course, you want to get those worse of the worse. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community and are here illegally, we need to focus on that.",

      "KAREN BASS: Well, I believe they've departed, but they were never needed in the first place. And the remaining ones are doing what they were doing all along, which is essentially protecting two federal buildings, one of which in Westwood, where there never has been a big protest against the immigration raids. This is just such an incredible misuse of not only taxpayers' money, but of the young people who are in the National Guard, who have had to leave their families, their jobs, and their education for this deployment that is completely unnecessary.",
      "Four thousand troops, my understanding is most of the time has been spent in complete boredom, playing video games, and essentially waiting around because, again, 4,000 deploy and about 200 actually used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House, of course, argues they deployed them because there was interference with the operations of law enforcement and carrying out some of the roundups.",

      "Why, though, is their identity important to you? Do you plan to prosecute them?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well, no. Let me just explain, because you have people who are literally walking down the street, sitting at bus stops, are individual vendors selling fruit on the street. These masked men pull up in unmarked cars and jump out of the cars with rifles and detain people. So, for the average citizen, it looks like it's a violent kidnapping. So, you should never have that. They don't identify themselves. And, furthermore, to your previous guest, how on earth do they know that they're a threat when they're just chasing random people through parking lots, at Home Depots, going to car washes and rounding up people. It's difficult to get your car washed in Los Angeles now because most of the car washes, the employees won't come to work out of fear that a raid will take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the acting director says that his agents, some of them fear that their families will be retaliated against, and that's why they are covering their faces, that they do wear markings for the agencies that they work with.",
      "KAREN BASS: So \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well \u2013 well, first of all, let me just tell you that the masked men are not from Los Angeles. And so, how their families could be retaliated against? And then what is that to say to local law enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department, none of whom are ever masked, who always identify themselves, and even hand someone a business card. So, that makes absolutely no sense at all.",
      "And I don't know, but I have a hard time believing that the woman selling pineapples on the corner will going to attack an ICE agent.",
      "And then when he says that there is identification, the problem is, many of these men are in plain clothes with vests on that say \"police.\" It looks like something that they could have gotten online. I think it's really important to point out the extreme nature of the randomness. And, you know, Homan has said, he's mentioned a number of criteria for why they stop people. One of the points of criteria is physical appearance. Los Angeles has 3.8 million people and about 50 percent of our population is Latino. So, I guess that means 50 percent of Los Angeles could be possible suspects in an immigration raid.",

      "KAREN BASS: It's ridiculous.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tom Homan has said, physical description cannot be the sole factor for reasonable suspicion. But things like location, occupation, physical appearance add up, particularly if a person runs away or if there's a tattoo or something. You don't seem to believe that.",
      "KAREN BASS: Location, sitting at a \u2013 well, location, sitting at a bus stop, walking down the street, selling fruit, no, I do dispute that, absolutely. And, you know, again, the National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. We did not ask for them. This is the federal seizure of power from a governor deploying the National Guard when the National Guard were not even needed.",

      "The Commanders hope to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., at the site of RFK Stadium \u2014 returning to the capital city almost 30 years after the team decamped to Maryland. The deal is complicated: The stadium sits on federal land, but Congress in January granted the city control over the land for 99 years, clearing the way for the property to be redeveloped. City councilors still need to approve the redevelopment plan.",
      "Meanwhile in baseball, the president also pushed the Cleveland Guardians MLB team to change back to the Cleveland Indians, a name the franchise got rid of in 2021.",
      "\"MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN,\" he wrote in the Sunday afternoon statement.",

The team's then-owner, Dan Snyder, had previously vowed to leave the name in place. The team settled on the name \"Commanders\" after a brief period in which it was known only as the \"Washington Football Team.\"",

      "Lyons cited the increase in attacks faced by agents at ICE, the agency at the center of President Trump's promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said attacks against ICE officials have increased by more than 800% this year compared to the same time period in 2024. Numerous instances of violence directed at ICE agents and facilities have occurred in recent weeks, including an armed attack against a detention center in Texas earlier this month that has led to more than a dozen arrests.",
      "Lyons agreed the increase in attacks faced by ICE agents could be partially attributed to the dramatic expansion in immigration arrests under the second Trump administration, acknowledging that the agency is \"more visible in the community.\"",
      "But he argued his agents are being forced to go into communities more often to arrest individuals living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal records, because more cities and states have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. Those policies lead many jurisdictions to refrain from notifying ICE when they release inmates who are also in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension,\" Lyons added. \"The immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it.\"",
      "Lyons says Medicaid data will be used to \"locate\" those in the U.S. illegally",
      "CBS News also asked Lyons about a report from the Associated Press that an inter-agency agreement had granted ICE access to the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and data on patients' race and ethnicity.",
      "Lyons said ICE is \"working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for.\"",
      "He cited the \"many\" so-called \"got-ways\" who entered the U.S. illegally without getting caught under the Biden administration and \"just totally disappeared off the grid.\"",
      "Lyons suggested ICE would use different datasets, including from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to locate the \"worst of the worst\" and those ordered deported from the U.S.",

      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:13:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 10:25:21 -0400",
    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",
      "\"In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

      "The observatory paired up with NASA's Webb Space Telescope to identify the minerals forming the new solar system. Researchers turned to data from our own solar system to determine that these minerals show the start of a new system. In Earth's solar system, the first solid materials to form can now be found inside ancient meteorites. Those ancient meteorites contain a mineral called silicon monoxide, which only forms at extremely high temperatures, like those near a young star.",
      "Scientists were able to identify the formation of silicon monoxide around HOPS-315, which they said tells them they've caught the development of a solar system at an early stage.",
      "\"This is the first time this early stage of planet-building has ever been observed outside our own Solar System,\" the Planetary Society wrote in a social media post about the discovery.",
      "The discovery marks \"the birth of the seeds of the planets,\" study co-author Edwin Bergin, a professor at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. The silicate-mineral rich material around HOPS-315 will make planets after another million years or so.",
      "\"So we are watching the beginnings of the construction of planets,\" Bergin said.",
      "With the discovery, Bergin said researchers now know what to look for to find other budding systems.",
      "ESO's Alma telescope network in Chile captured an image of the still-forming planetary system around HOPS-315. In orange, the image shows the distribution of carbon monoxide blowing away from HOPS-315. Blue shows a narrow jet of silicon monoxide, which is also beaming away from the baby star.",

      "HOPS-315 is much younger than the Sun; it's about 100,000 years old, Bergin said.",
      "\"So we get a glimpse of the system in its infancy,\" Bergin said in an email. \"Given that the Sun is 4.6 Billion years old this is a baby star that is still gaining mass and getting bigger.\"",

The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "The pilot of a SkyWest flight told passengers Friday night that he performed an \"aggressive maneuver\" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft in-flight as he came in for a landing in Minot, North Dakota \u2014 then apologized for the sudden move.",
      "The airline said in a statement that SkyWest flight 3788, operating as Delta Connection on a flight from Minneapolis, \"landed safely in Minot after being cleared for approach by the tower but performing a go-around when another aircraft became visible in their flight path. We are investigating the incident.\"",
      "SkyWest said the flight had 76 passengers and four crew members on board.",
      "In a video recorded by passenger Monica Green and obtained by CBS News, the pilot is heard calmly announcing to passengers: \"For those of you on the right-hand side, you probably saw the airplane kinda sorta coming at us. Nobody told us about it and so we continued.\"",
      "The pilot explained that the tower at the Minot airport doesn't have radar, so air traffic controllers do everything visually.",
      "The pilot said he \"saw the airplane that was kind of coming on a converging course with us.\"",
      "\"Given his speed,\" the pilot continued, \"it was a military (aircraft). I don't know how fast they were going but they were a lot faster than us. I thought the safest thing to do was to turn behind it. So, sorry about the aggressive maneuver. It caught me by surprise.\"",
      "\"This is not normal at all. I don't know why they didn't give us a heads-up because the (nearby) Air Force base does have radar and nobody said, 'Hey, there's also a B-52 in the pattern.'\"",
      "\"Long story short, it was not fun but I do apologize for it and I thank you for everything. It was not a fun day at work today,\" the pilot added, at which point the passengers started applauding.",
      "The Air Force confirmed in a statement to CBS News on Monday that a B-52 aircraft assigned to Minot Air Force Base was operating in the area at the time, having conducted a flyover of the North Dakota State Fair.",
      "Minot Air Force Base said later Monday in a statement that the B-52 was performing the flyover for \"a special event recognizing the city of Minot as a 'Great American Defense Community.'\"",
      "\"The flyover was planned in advance and approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. This included the FAA's local Flight Standards District Office, Minot International Airport air traffic control personnel, and Minot Approach Control,\" the base said.",
      "The base said it communicated the flyover plans to Minot Approach Control throughout the event and that, while in a planned holding pattern, the B-52 crew \"communicated the flyover plan to both RAPCON and Minot International Airport's air traffic control tower.\"",
      "\"Minot Approach directed the B-52 crew at 7:43 p.m. to contact Minot International Airport's air traffic control. The B-52 crew contacted Minot International Airport tower and the tower provided instructions to continue 2 miles westbound after the flyover. The tower did not advise of the inbound commercial aircraft,\" the base said.",
      "An Air Force spokesperson previously told CBS News, \"We are aware of the recent reporting regarding commercial and Air Force aircraft operating in airspace around Minot International Airport. We are currently looking into the matter.\"",
      "Green, the passenger who recorded the video, said that as the aircraft was descending, she felt it jolt to the right.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge overseeing his criminal case to put off his release from custody for 30 days if the judge rejects a Justice Department bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting a trial.",
      "Abrego Garcica's lawyers said in a filing that the 30-day pause in issuing a release order would give him time to evaluate his legal options in response to likely efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to deport him.",
      "\"We have been advised by the government that if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings,\" they wrote.",
      "The Justice Department does not object to the request, and Abrego Garcia's legal team said that the delay would not affect their ability to come up with a proposed schedule leading up to his criminal trial.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted Abrego Garcia\u00a0in late May on two counts of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to both counts. A trial in his case is set to begin in January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, but his removal gained headlines after a federal immigration official acknowledged it was an administrative error. An immigration judge had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented DHS from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland after coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011, and his wife filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump administration in March challenging his removal, and a federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "After weeks of back-and-forth \u2014 and his case reaching the Supreme Court \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in early June that Abrego Garcia had been released from Salvadoran custody and brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from his alleged participation in a scheme to smuggle undocumented migrants into the country.",
      "A federal magistrate judge last month ordered Abrego Garcia's release from federal law enforcement custody while he awaits a trial, but that raised concerns that he would be swiftly detained by immigration agents and possibly deported. The Justice Department appealed that decision and asked a U.S. district judge to revoke the release order.",
      "The judge overseeing the criminal case, Waverly Crenshaw, held a hearing last week on the government's motion but has not yet ruled on whether to grant it. If Crenshaw denies the bid, it would give the green-light for Abrego Garcia to be released from criminal custody.",
      "But the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings has created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "In the ongoing civil case in Maryland, the federal judge is considering a separate request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers to return him to Maryland immediately after he is released from confinement in the criminal proceedings that are ongoing in Tennessee. They also asked the judge to bar the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer who was convicted in the death of\u00a0Breonna Taylor,\u00a0a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was sentenced on Monday to 33 months in prison.",
      "Taylor was shot and killed on March 13, 2020, during a botched    drug raid authorized by the Louisville Metro Police Department. A Louisville detective at the time, Hankison, 46, was found guilty last November of violating Taylor's civil rights while executing a search warrant on her home, which resulted in the tragedy.",
      "Hankison will not report directly to prison, with U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings saying during Monday's sentencing hearing that the Bureau of Prisons will decide when his sentence begins, according to The Associated Press. His prison sentence will be followed by three years of supervised probation.",
      "The Justice Department had requested in a sentencing memo following Hankison's conviction that he be sentenced with time served, which would be\u00a0just one day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Jennings said during the hearing that a sentence of no prison time for Hankison \"is not appropriate,\" according to The Associated Press.",
      "Jennings criticized the Justice Department's sentencing memo, calling it \"incongruous and inappropriate,\" and saying the department treated Hankison's actions as \"an inconsequential crime,\" AP reported.",
      "\"While today's sentence is not what we had hoped for \u2014 nor does it fully reflect the severity of the harm caused \u2014 it is more than what the Department of Justice sought. That, in itself, is a statement,\" attorneys representing Taylor's family said in a statement after the sentencing. \"The jury found Brett Hankison guilty, and that verdict deserved to be met with real accountability.\"",
      "\"Tamika Palmer asked for a sentence consistent with federal guidelines and the law. We respect the court's decision, but we will continue to call out the DOJ's failure to stand firmly behind Breonna's rights and the rights of every Black woman whose life is treated as expendable,\" the attorneys said.",
      "The sentence hearing drew a crowd outside the federal courthouse in downtown Louisville, and at least four people, including Taylor's aunt, Bianca Austin, were detained Monday afternoon, CBS affiliate WLKY reported.",
      "Police said individuals were \"creating confrontation, kicking vehicles\" and \"creating an unsafe environment.\" It wasn't immediately clear what charges would be filed.",
      "There were also protesters when a federal jury in Louisville convicted Hankison on one count of civil rights abuse last year. He was accused of depriving Taylor of her constitutional rights when he, separate from other officers with him at the scene, used excessive force to fire multiple shots through a sliding glass door and window on the side of her building, despite both being covered by blinds and curtains.",
      "The jury found that Hankison used a dangerous weapon when he committed the offense and that his actions involved an attempt to kill, although the shots he fired did not strike Taylor, the Department of Justice said after his conviction. He also faced a second count for allegedly depriving Taylor's neighbors of their constitutional rights, as his bullets pierced through the walls and narrowly missed a family of three in the adjacent apartment, but jurors found him not guilty on that charge.",
      "Hankison had pleaded not guilty to each of the charges.",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Taylor's family, had called the Justice Department's request for minimal sentencing \"an insult to the life of Breonna Taylor and a blatant betrayal of the jury's decision.\"",
      "\"This sets a dangerous precedent,\" Crump said in a statement responding to the memo. \"When a police officer is found guilty of violating someone's constitutional rights, there must be real accountability and justice. Recommending just one day in prison sends the unmistakable message that white officers can violate the civil rights of Black Americans with near-total impunity.\"",
      "Taylor's death sparked a national outcry and contributed significantly to a period of public reckoning that followed over what critics said was systemic racial injustice and police brutality in the U.S. After she was killed, police found no evidence of narcotics inside her home.",
      "Evidence presented during Hankison's trial showed that he and two colleagues, former Louisville officers Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, arrived at Taylor's home at 12:45 a.m. on the night of the fatal shooting, while she and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were asleep. Believing intruders were breaking into the residence, Walker fired one shot from his own gun toward the officers he had mistaken for civilian trespassers. The shot wounded Mattingly and prompted all three officers to open fire into the apartment.",
      "Two other Louisville officers, former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany, also face charges over Taylor's death. Jaynes and Meany are charged with federal civil rights offenses and obstruction of justice for their involvement in the preparing and authorizing of an affidavit for the search warrant that ultimately led to the shooting.",
      "Another former Louisville officer, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy for helping Jaynes and Meany obtain the warrant. Trials for Jaynes and Meany have yet to take place.",

      "The federal government on Monday released thousands of records on the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 a move that was ordered by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents, which number over 230,000 pages, \"had never been digitized and sat collecting dust in facilities across the federal government for decades, until today.\"",
      "The records include the FBI's \"discussion of potential leads, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and documents related to James Earl Ray's former cellmate, who stated he discussed with Ray an alleged assassination plot,\" according to ODNI. The agency says the release also includes CIA records on the search for Ray, who fled the U.S. before he was eventually captured and pleaded guilty to assassinating King.",
      "\"The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government's investigation into Dr. King's assassination,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "ODNI called Monday's release \"the first time these records are published online in one collection with minimal redactions,\" though it said some records had been made public previously through Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "ODNI said King's relatives were \"provided an opportunity to review the files\" two weeks ago.",
      "Prior to the release, some relatives of King pushed back on the plan: \"For us, the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.\"",
      "King's two living children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, said in a statement Monday they understood the records have \"long been a subject of interest,\" but urged people to engage with the files \"with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continued grief.\"",
      "The statement \u2014 released by the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change \u2014 pointed to the FBI's yearslong surveillance of King in the 1960s, which a Justice Department report later concluded was \"very probably\" illegal.",
      "\"While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,\" the family members said. \"Those who promote the fruit of the FBI's surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.\"",
      "Bernice King addressed the release of the files in a \"Vanity Fair\" story Monday, writing, \"I wonder why I have to be confronted once again with something that was very confusing and distressing for me as a five-year-old. I am, honestly, not prepared to revisit the gruesome details of this painful history. For me, there is no real value in it; there is only reliving the trauma.\" Later Monday, she wrote on X, \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",
      "King's niece, Alveda King, said in ODNI's statement she supported the release, calling it \"a historic step towards the truth that the American people deserve.\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump ordered the government to declassify and release federal records on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, along with the 1968 killings of King and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Records on JFK were released in March, and the government released several tranches of documents on RFK starting in April.",
      "All three assassinations have drawn decades of public curiosity, including theories about whether the people accused and convicted of assassinating the three men acted alone or were even responsible for the killings.",
      "Ray pleaded guilty to murdering King in Memphis one year after the assassination, and was sentenced to 99 years in prison, but he later recanted his guilty plea and spent years unsuccessfully seeking a new trial. He died in 1998.",
      "Members of King's family have contended that Ray was not the shooter. Their statement Monday pointed to a 1999 wrongful death suit in Tennessee civil court in which a jury concluded a man named Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators, \"including government agencies,\" were linked to King's assassination.",
      "Other official findings have varied. The Justice Department conducted reviews of the assassination in 1977 and 2000, which asserted that Ray was the assassin and that he didn't act as part of a conspiracy. In the 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that King was likely assassinated as part of a conspiracy involving Ray, but that the government wasn't involved.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:23:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard released a memorandum and files regarding the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions during the 2016 election.",
    "story": [
      "The release of more than 100 pages of declassified files and a memorandum by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reignited political battles over Russia's actions during the 2016 presidential election, a topic that has long incensed President Trump and put the actions of the U.S. intelligence community in partisan crosshairs.",
      "Gabbard's office on Friday alleged in the memorandum, which accompanied the files, that they contained what she called evidence of \"suppression\" and manipulation of the intelligence underlying a 2017 community-wide assessment of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The files include email exchanges, excerpts from a President's Daily Brief and a readout from a principals committee meeting, chiefly from a period during the Obama administration.",
      "In a statement and social media posts, Gabbard claimed the materials, which were marked declassified on July 17, 2025, were evidence of a \"treasonous conspiracy\" and \"years-long coup\" plotted by Obama administration officials against Mr. Trump, and said she would forward them to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal referral. She also said in subsequent media appearances that more declassifications about the matter would be made.",
      "Democrats fiercely disputed her claims, pointing to the findings of a bipartisan Senate investigation that concluded Russia had attempted to influence the 2016 election. They accused Gabbard herself of misrepresenting intelligence findings and processes.",
      "\"What you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt,\" said Congressman Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday.",
      "\"[T]he intelligence community is full of very good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest,\" Himes said.",
      "\"This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement.",
      "The memorandum released by Gabbard appears to conflate different kinds of Russian operations during the 2016 election cycle while alleging Obama administration officials fabricated a narrative designed to undermine Mr. Trump. It points several times to select phrases in the documents that say Russia lacked the intent or the capability to use cyber operations to target U.S. election infrastructure, change vote tallies, and overturn the election \u2014 which previous investigations agreed did not happen.",
      "But while no evidence emerged to indicate Russia engaged in a vote-switching cyberattack, there was evidence that showed a multi-pronged Kremlin influence campaign that attempted to sway American voters. That influence campaign included hack-and-leak operations and social media posts designed to undermine the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and bolster then-candidate Trump's, according to the intelligence community's assessment.",
      "In the years after the 2016 presidential election, multiple reviews of the intelligence community's findings \u2014 including the Senate report and an investigation led by special counsel John Durham, who was appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 reinforced its conclusions.",
      "A CIA review of the tradecraft involved in the agency's assessment released earlier this month found some of its judgments may have been rushed and the confidence levels attached to one of them may have been too high, but it did not change the conclusion that Russia's efforts were designed to benefit Mr. Trump's candidacy.",
      "Gabbard's statements on Friday were praised and recirculated multiple times by the president, senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton wrote in a social media post, \"It will take decades for the Intelligence Community to recover from the damage done during the Obama and Biden presidencies.\"",
      "Senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote that Gabbard had \"exposed the startling depths of a seditious coup against the Republic.\"",
      "The memorandum also criticizes leaks from what it terms \"IC officials\" or \"Deep State officials in the IC\" \u2014 with \"IC\" referring to the intelligence community \u2014 to media outlets at the time the assessments were being drafted that said Russia had intervened in the election in an effort to help President Trump. The memo does not, however, identify these individuals or provide other evidence about the origin of those disclosures.",
      "It also highlights instances in which certain agencies disputed or pushed to change language included in evolving intelligence assessments of Russia's cyber activity. For instance, it cites an FBI official who suggested in an exchange in September of 2016 that language about Russia's intent to use cyber attacks to disrupt the 2016 election be \"softened.\"",
      "\"[W]e would prefer for the first sentence regarding Russia's intent to be softened,\" the official wrote. \"The way it currently reads, it would indicate that we have definitive information that Russia does intend to disrupt our elections and we are uncomfortable making that assessment at this point.\"",
      "Dissents from different agencies are common and conclusions can change as more intelligence is collected or analysis is done, according to current and former officials familiar with the drafting process for intelligence assessments. It is not clear from the redacted selection of emails released by Gabbard how the language flagged by the FBI was finalized.",
      "Warner has expressed concerns about the effect of Gabbard's recent actions on intelligence sharing by partners of the United States, noting that representatives of the intelligence-sharing alliance known as the Five Eyes \u2014 which includes the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2014 had approached him for answers.",
      "\"I have had Five Eye partners say, 'Warner, what the hell is going on?'\" Warner said during a panel discussion at last week's Aspen Security forum, hours before the 2016 files were released. \"I do believe our Five Eyes partners and others are not sharing as much information as they would.\"",

      "The White House has removed a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for President Trump's upcoming trip to Scotland, over the Journal's story on what it called a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein that the paper alleged was signed by Mr. Trump in the early 2000s.",
      "A Wall Street Journal reporter was slated to join the president and a small group of other reporters aboard Air Force One as a part of the traveling press pool for Mr. Trump's trip to Scotland later this month. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that because of what she called the paper's \"fake and defamatory conduct,\" the Wall Street Journal will not participate. Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit over the story on Friday, asking for at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "\"Thirteen diverse outlets will participate in the press pool to cover the president's trip to Scotland. Due to the Wall Street Journal's fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"Every news organization in the entire world wishes to cover President Trump, and the White House has taken significant steps to include as many voices as possible.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal has not yet responded to a request for comment. The paper has stood by its reporting.",
      "On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0published a story\u00a0claiming the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003.",
      "The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\" CBS News has not reviewed or verified the letter.",
      "Mr. Trump is visiting his ancestral home of Scotland from July 25-29, with stops in Aberdeen and Turnberry, where he owns golf courses.",
      "Being a part of the press pool allows a small but rotating group of reporters access to the president's daily happenings and travels, often offering journalists opportunities to ask questions of the president.",
      "The White House Correspondents' Association urged the Trump administration to reverse its decision.",
      "\"This attempt by the White House to punish a media outlet whose coverage it does not like is deeply troubling, and it defies the First Amendment. Government retaliation against news outlets based on the content of their reporting should concern all who value free speech and an independent media,\" said WHCA President Weijia Jiang, who also serves as CBS News' senior White House correspondent.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted more power over the press pool than prior administrations, which have usually deferred to the White House press corps to decide who participates and when.",
      "The Associated Press's access to\u00a0spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One was curtailed earlier this year for not abiding by Mr. Trump's decision to change the Gulf of Mexico's name to the Gulf of America. The wire service sued over the change, winning an early victory in district court, but an appeals court eventually let the Trump administration limit the AP's access to restricted spaces.",
      "\"As the appeals court confirmed, the Wall Street Journal or any other news outlet are not guaranteed special access to cover President Trump in the Oval Office, aboard Air Force One, and in his private workspaces,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",

      "Maps show July heat alerts and forecasts",
      "As the extreme heat hits parts of the Corn Belt, a region over part of the Plains and Central Mississippi Valley where heat index values could reach between 105 and 110 degrees, high humidity is also expected. The common phenomenon is known as corn sweat, which occurs when extreme heat beats down on corn crop and causes it to perspire and increase the humidity in the air.",

      "High humidity coupled with extreme temperatures is dangerous because the combination significantly increases the likelihood of heat-related illnesses. Little to no overnight relief also poses a greater threat to health, NWS Prediction Center says.",
      "Heat waves increasingly intensified by climate change",
      "Climate change has made excessive heat in July at least three times more likely for nearly 160 million people in the U.S., nearly half the population, a Climate Central analysis found.",
      "Using its calculation of data and what is called a Climate Shift Index (CSI), the nonprofit said Monday that human-caused climate change made this extreme heat at least five times more likely for certain areas, from Salt Lake City and Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Tallahassee, Florida, and Montgomery, Alabama.",
      "The CSI uses real-time data to estimate how climate change has increased the likelihood of a particular daily temperature, according to Climate Central.",
      "Last month, another heat dome exposed nearly half of the country to dangerously high temperatures. On June 24, seven states tied or broke monthly high temperature records, many exceeding triple digits. One of those states, Maryland, reported that 472 people needed medical assistance for heat-related illnesses during that time when the heat index topped 110 degrees in some places.",
      "With such events becoming more common, Democratic lawmakers last week proposed legislation to classify extreme heat as a disaster, which would allow federal funding to flow into areas where hotter temperatures cause significant physical and economic distress.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell is urging President Trump to prioritize modernizing the nation's weather forecasting system, saying the investment will save lives as well as money down the road. She released a letter to the president Monday, following through on her pledge to provide guidance that the administration can use to upgrade weather forecasting infrastructure.",
      "\"The money will save you money, for sure,\" Cantwell said in an interview on CBS News Monday. \"The kind of investments you could make here are about taking a $20 billion [disaster] event and saying, if we would have done these things in advance, it wouldn't have cost us that much money. If storms are costing us this much, we have to come up with better solutions.\"",
      "The Democratic congresswoman, a prominent voice in environmental policy on Capitol Hill and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees weather and disasters. Cantwell penned the letter in the wake of disastrous flooding that killed at least 135 people in Central Texas. The July 4 flash flood prompted a massive search and recovery operations and raised questions about whether forecasts and warnings could have been more effective\u00a0ahead of time.",
      "Cantwell's letter outlined five bipartisan recommendations to improve U.S. forecasting. It comes as\u00a0the Trump administration continues to make cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency focused on weather and climate, and the National Weather Service, its subagency in charge of daily forecasts.",
      "NOAA\u00a0is slated to see a 27% reduction in its budget at the start of the 2026 fiscal year, which could impact weather forecasting in a number of ways, including terminating research programs aimed at helping predict future precipitation rates and improve flash flood warning systems. The committee recently held a confirmation hearing for Dr. Neil Jacobs to become NOAA's new leader.",
      "\"Communities across the United States are experiencing more frequent, intense, and costly flash floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, atmospheric rivers, landslides, heatwaves, and wildfires,\" Cantwell's letter said. She cited deadly \u2014 and costly \u2014 natural disasters that have ravaged communities around the United States in the last two years alone, including the Texas floods as well as last year's flooding from Hurricane Helene in\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0and the devastating fires in\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0and the Hawaiian island of Maui.",
      "Examples like these suggest \"that providing Americans with more timely and accurate weather information can avoid billions in property losses and save lives,\" she wrote.",
      "Responding to the letter, a White House spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that \"the Trump administration has already been hard at work on re-orienting NOAA and NWS [the National Weather Service] away from pursuing climate change activism to instead focus on its core mission and modernizing the agencies' outdated technology to provide faster, more accurate weather models.\"",
      "Cantwell's recommendations emphasize improvements in how weather data is collected and analyzed, as well as systems for notifying communities of severe weather. They include:",
      "Upgrading the country's Doppler radar network with \"phased array radar,\" a higher resolution system to monitor weather conditions, profile wind patterns and perform aircraft tracking simultaneously. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said this type of radar allows for more \"focused observations of storms,\" compared with Doppler's abilities, and provides quicker updates for meteorologists tasked with predicting and alerting the public to sudden changes during an extreme event.Replacing older weather satellites, relied on by NOAA and its National Weather Service, with next-generation satellites, which \"can track lightning strikes that start wildfires, wildfire smoke, red tides that poison fisheries, and generally provide better extreme weather early warning capabilities,\" according to Cantwell's letter.Improving NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System, which uses instruments like buoys to collects ocean data that is often integral to weather forecasting, including for search and rescue initiatives and navigation more broadly.Investing in supercomputing, data analytics, and a forecasting technique called data assimilation, to increase the accuracy of NOAA's weather prediction model, which tends to be less accurate than its European counterpart.Bolstering weather and climate research through NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. The office is a bedrock of climate prediction efforts worldwide, multiple meteorologists currently and formerly employed by the federal agency have told CBS News. But Mr. Trump's 2026 budget plan proposes eliminating it altogether.Modernizing weather alert systems to help first responders and the public prepare for, and react to, extreme weather events.Advancing bipartisan legislation that supports expanding weather research and forecasting endeavors, such as the Weather Act Reauthorization Act of 2024, which Cantwell introduced alongside Sen.

    "summary": "Trump said he wants a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' congressional map \u2014 it would enable Republicans to pick up five seats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Texas Legislature is convening Monday for a special session where it will attempt to redraw the state's congressional map to boost President Trump and his allies' efforts to maintain the GOP's grip on the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The state's decision to recraft the boundaries of House districts comes midway through the decade and several years after its GOP-controlled Legislature adopted a redistricting plan in the wake of the 2020 Census.",
      "Under that plan, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. (The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open.)",
      "But with Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and the risk the GOP could lose control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, a reshaping of the congressional districts could give Mr. Trump's party an edge heading into next year's elections.",
      "Mr. Trump's political team had been pushing Texas GOP leaders to look into redrawing the state's congressional map, The New York Times reported last month. Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed the Legislature would undertake the effort, among 17 other agenda items, when it meets. Ahead of the start of the special session, the Texas House speaker announced the creation of a new 21-member select committee on congressional redistricting. The panel consists of 12 Republican state House members and nine Democrats.",
      "\"I don't think this has anything to do with Texas \u2014 this has to do with Trump,\" said Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project. \"This has nothing to do with the internal dynamics of the state, the political trajectory of the state. This is purely about this election cycle and one person's benefit.\"",
      "How did we get here?",
      "States undergo the redistricting process after every 10-year census, when voting lines are redrawn to account for population changes. After the 2020 Census, Texas crafted a new congressional map to include two new districts, bringing its total number of House seats to 38.",
      "The maps drawn by the GOP-led Texas Legislature aimed to protect Republican seats in Congress and the statehouse. Democrats flipped two congressional districts and 12 state House seats in the 2018 midterms.",
      "\"In 2021, they spent a lot of time and effort making sure they had the best maps possible with the primary goal to ensure that the Republican majority was rock solid,\" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. \"And they created 24 of 38 districts where there is no way, shape or form that a Republican is losing those districts, absent some type of murder indictment or a serial adulterer, etc.\"",
      "But the final version of the congressional map was met with criticism, and it has been challenged in court. Among the issues raised by voting rights groups is that 95% of Texas' growth has been driven by non-White voters, but the map crafted in 2021 created more majority-White districts.",
      "A three-judge panel in El Paso is currently considering a consolidated challenge to the map brought by voting rights groups, Latino voters and lawmakers. The plaintiffs argue that the new lines violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. A trial ended in June.",
      "Texas has a part-time Legislature, which meets for 140 days every two years. The governor has the power to call special sessions to cover specific topics, and the special sessions constitutionally cannot last longer than 30 days. The governor can, however, call as many special sessions as he deems necessary. After the 88th legislative session in 2023, Abbott called four special sessions that stretched into December.",
      "Redistricting is one of 18 topics that Abbott has asked the Legislature to address. Four of those topics include disaster relief for the Central Texas floods and improving the state's warning system.",
      "\"I'm not convinced that the goal is to pass everything, but ultimately, Abbott gets the credit for trying, and the Legislature will get the credit for what it can accomplish, but it'll also get the blame for what it fails to do,\" Blank said.",
      "Although the Democrats could leave the state to deny Republicans a quorum, like they did in 2021 to protest a voting bill, it's unlikely they would do so if it meant holding up flood relief.",
      "Where does Trump and his administration come into play?",
      "Texas has conducted two congressional elections under the 2021 map. But earlier this month, the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter alleging that some of the districts were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, specifically pinpointed four districts \u2014 the 9th, 18th, 29th and 33rd \u2014 that she said constitute \"coalition districts\" that should be redrawn. All three are currently represented by Democrats, and Turner, who died in March, represented the fourth.",
      "Coalition districts are those that bring two or more racial minorities together to make up a majority of the population, and where voters from these groups vote together to elect their preferred candidate.",
      "In her letter, Dhillon wrote that the state had to \"immediately\" rectify the alleged racial gerrymanders, and if it chose not to, it was at risk of legal action by the attorney general.",
      "\"The congressional districts at issue are nothing more than vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas,\" she wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to be on board with the recrafting of Texas' voting boundaries. Before leaving the White House on Tuesday, the president said he is looking for a \"simple redrawing\" where Republicans pick up five seats.",
      "\"Texas would be the biggest one,\" he said.",
      "But during the trial in the case involving the congressional map, state officials repeatedly said they were motivated not by race when they drew the district lines, but instead driven by politics. State Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican who led the 2021 Senate Redistricting Committee, testified that the congressional map was \"drawn blind to race\" and \"racial data was not considered at all during the drawing of the maps,\" according to court records.",
      "\"There is no legal justification for doing this. It sort of walks and talks and quacks like a political move,\" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \"The problem is that it's really difficult to get more seats in Texas without heavily undermining the political power of communities of color.\"",
      "In claims of racial gerrymandering, those challenging a map have to show that race predominated for how the lines were drawn.",
      "\"This can't be a racial gerrymander if they didn't consider race,\" Li said. \"This is a textbook, easy it's-not-a-racial-gerrymander. \u2026 If you didn't consider race, it can't be a racial gerrymander.\"",
      "Has Texas drawn new maps in the middle of the decade before?",
      "A divided Texas Legislature drew up a congressional map in 2001, but two years later, in a plan engineered by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, Republicans wanted to redraw the lines to make the most of the growing GOP majority in the state.",
      "Fifty-one Democrats in the state House fled to Oklahoma for four days, denying the Republicans the quorum they needed to bring the redistricting plan to the floor and letting the clock run out on the regular session. Then-Gov. Rick Perry called the Legislature back for a special session, but state Senate Democrats left the state to deny a quorum.",
      "Although the Democrats remained out of state for more than a month, they couldn't stop the maps from eventually passing, and Republicans ultimately picked up five seats. The Supreme Court upheld the congressional districts in 2018.",
      "But former Democratic Rep. Mark Strama, who ran for office after that round of redistricting, warned the effort did have some downsides for Republicans. The drama was covered nationally, and Strama himself flipped a Central Texas district in 2005.",
      "\"Voters were mad at both sides,\" Strama said. \"They hate all these political shenanigans. But there's no question voters hate this.\"",
      "While Texas has redrawn the lines of congressional districts in the middle of a decade before, Li said the current situation is far from normal.",
      "\"Outside of litigation, it is extremely rare,\" he said. \"And it's exceptionally rare \u2014 in fact, I can't think of another circumstance, where a party drew the map, and then that same party redrew the map. Where there are mid-decade redistrictings, it's usually because political control changes hands.\"",
      "Could this plan backfire?",
      "While Democrats have not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, the best year Democrats have had at the ballot in the past two decades was in 2018. In that midterm election, former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within three points of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and Democrats flipped two congressional seats and 12 state House seats.",
      "Republicans have managed to quell those gains and, as Jones noted, the 2024 election was a high point for the party. But the dynamics of the 2026 election could mirror those in 2018, when Democrats ran aggressive campaigns targeting Mr. Trump and retook the House. Any changes to the congressional map might not be enough to stem Democratic gains this time around.",
      "\"If Republicans do engage, do go all out and try with the goal of flipping, say three, four, even five seats as President Trump says \u2014 it's far more likely Republicans see a net loss than a net gain,\" Jones said.",
      "Plus, any map adopted by the GOP-led Legislature and approved by Abbott is likely to be swiftly met with lawsuits. If a federal court blocks its use, the new district lines may not even be in place for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"President Trump is talking about five more seats out of Texas, and the only way you get five more seats out of Texas is if you seriously undermine the political power and the political voice of communities of color,\" Li said. \"And that is a Texas-sized lawsuit with potentially huge ramifications.\"",
      "Li said the redrawing of political bounds to give Republicans a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections is not only a legally risky move, but could be politically perilous too.",
      "\"The essence of trying to get more seats is that you have to spread your voters out more if you're a Republican,\" he said. \"So you have a bunch more districts that you're not winning by 65 or 70%. You're going to have a bunch of districts that you're winning by 52, 53% and in a state that is changing as fast as Texas, that's growing as fast as Texas, that's changing demographically as fast as Texas. By 2030, these districts could look and perform very differently.\"",
      "The 2020 Census showed that people of color accounted for 95% of Texas' population growth over the prior decade. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau released last year also showed that the number of Asian Americans in Texas grew by nearly 92,000 people, while there were more than 91,000 new Black residents in the state.",
      "\"When you gerrymander, you're making a bet that you know what the politics of the future will look like,\" Li said. \"There are many places where you can safely bet on what the politics of the future will look like in the country. Texas is not one of those places. It's just changing too fast.\"",
      "Republicans have made big gains in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, once considered a Democratic stronghold. But even with those GOP gains \u2014 and running on the maps drawn in 2021\u00a0 \u2014 two of the three seats remained Democratic in 2024.",
      "\"People talk about the Rio Grande Valley as if it's somehow indicative of Texas,\" said Blank of the Texas Politics Project. \"It's less than 3.5% of the total statewide vote, and it's incredibly economically depressed and it's overwhelmingly Hispanic. It's not really indicative of any part of the state, it's indicative of its region of the country that happens to share a border with Mexico.\"",
      "What can Democrats do?",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the states have lambasted Republicans for pushing to redraw congressional district lines to hold onto power in the House.",
      "\"Elected officials should earn the support of voters they hope to represent,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday. \"Republicans want a country where politicians choose their voters, not the other way around. It reeks of desperation, and we're going to do everything that we can in Texas and beyond to respond.\"",
      "Jeffries said the reason for the special session in Texas is to \"try to steal the midterm elections by rigging\" the state's congressional map.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, has suggested that Democrats mount their own partisan gerrymander. California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats represent 43 of them.",
      "\"There are *currently* 9 Republicans in the California Congressional Delegation. Just thought folks might like to know that fun fact,\" he wrote on X\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "During an appearance on the podcast \"Pod Save America,\" Newsom accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the game\" because they're concerned about maintaining control of the House next year.",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that handed over the task of crafting congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But Newsom suggested there are still two paths that could lead to a new congressional map: calling a special session of the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot for a special election that would clear the way for new House district lines; or having the state Legislature create a new map under the idea that it's coming mid-decade and not after the census.",
      "\"It ups the stakes of the redistricting war, with the acknowledgment that Democrats have a limited hand to play,\" Li said of Texas' decision to draw new congressional lines.",
      "Just 15 states have Democratic trifectas, where they control the state legislature and the governorship. Two of those states, Colorado and Michigan, leave the drawing of political voting lines to independent commissions like California does. Republicans are in full control in 23 states.",
      "Plus, in other states where Democrats control the legislature and governor's mansions, the congressional delegations already heavily skew Democratic. In Illinois, for example, Democrats hold 14 of its 17 House seats. Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation contains just one Republican.",
      "Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a former House lawmaker who has left the door open for a Senate run next year, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" on Monday that Democrats should \"fight fire with fire,\" referring to Newsom's suggestion of taking on redistricting in California.",
      "\"Far too often, Democrats are more interested in being right than they are in being in power,\" O'Rourke said. \"If we're coloring in the lines while the Republicans are tearing up the coloring book right in front of us, we're going to continue to lose power and be less relevant to the Americans that we want to support and help\"",

    "summary": "\"48 Hours\" goes inside the painstaking investigation through the eyes of those who have spent more than three decades trying to find the 6-year-old boy and to bring closure to his heartbroken parents",
    "story": [
      "Editor's note: On July 21, 2025, a federal appeals court ruled that Pedro Hernandez should have a new trial or be released. The Manhattan DA's office is reviewing the decision.",
      "This story originally aired on April 14, 2018.",
      "Etan Patz walked out of his New York City home headed for a school bus stop just two blocks away. The 6-year-old never made it to school that day in 1979 \u2013 and he's never been found.",
      "His disappearance is a story that shocked New York City and to this day haunts law enforcement investigators who have spent decades trying to find him. The disappearance of the young boy is more than a missing person's case. Indeed, it changed the way parents watched over their kids.",
      "\"I think this was one of the most significant unsolved cases in the history of New York City,\" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. tell \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger.",
      "\"Every missing child case is very important, but this was one of the oldest ones we had,\" says NYPD Lieutenant Chris Zimmerman.",
      "Etan Patz disappeared at a time long before social media and every storefront had a video camera. He had asked his parents to let him do the short walk to the bus stop alone for the first time. He had a dollar to buy a soda at a corner deli. His parents were unaware he was missing until he didn't return home after school. Since then, Patz's smiling image used on missing person's fliers is seared into the minds of people around the country.",
      "\"That photo will always haunt me. And every single day that I sent my son out to school, I thought of Etan Patz,\" says attorney Brian O'Dwyer. \"And I was one of eight million New Yorkers like that.\"",
      "Police began searching for Patz by going door to door. Over the years, the case would grow cold. But there was one neighborhood man police suspected of being a pedophile, whom they had their eye on almost from the beginning: Jose Ramos. Ramos, according to law enforcement, had said he took a child back to his apartment and molested him. Ramos told them he was 90 percent sure it was Patz. The case against Ramos, however, lacked corroboration, and never moved forward, says Vance.",
      "Vance vowed to take a fresh look at Etan's disappearance when he took office in 2010. \"I was on the hunt for the Patz family to find the killer,\" he says.",
      "Then in 2012, the NYPD got a tip from a relative of Pedro Hernandez, saying Hernandez had talked about hurting a boy around the time Patz disappeared. During questioning by police, Hernandez told them he choked a boy. He later took them to locations near the Patz home. Was Hernandez telling the truth?",
      "\"The facts of that confession make no sense,\" says Hernandez's attorney Harvey Fishbein. \"He's unreliable because of his psychiatric condition.\"",
      "What happened to Etan Patz?",
      "THE SEARCH FOR ETAN",
      "After more than 30 years, it took a new team of investigators and a new prosecutor to breathe new life into an old case \u2013 trying to find out what happened to Etan Patz.",
      "District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.:\u00a0 You really should never close the book on a case if you think there's the possibility that it can be solved.",
      "In 2012, investigators were literally digging for clues just blocks away from where Etan was last seen. \u00a0After thousands of dead-end leads, the public held its collective breath hoping, this time, the case might finally be solved.",
      "Etan Patz was just 6 years old, and like many kids that age, he wanted some independence. It was 1979, the last day of school before the Memorial Day weekend, and Etan's mother, Julie, finally agreed to let Etan walk alone to the school bus stop. It was just two blocks away from their Manhattan apartment.",
      "Julie Patz | Etan's mother [1980]: Yes, I wish I hadn't let him go to the bus stop that morning alone. \u2026My feelings that morning were very positive about his going.",
      "Etan was carrying a book bag and a dollar to buy a soda at a corner store near the bus stop \u2013 and then, he seemed to vanish.",
      "Julie and her husband Stan didn't realize their son was missing until that afternoon when he didn't come home from school. Julie called the school and learned Etan never arrived and his friends never saw him at the bus stop. So she called the police.",
      "Patrick Eanniello | Former NYPD detective: I didn't wanna start with something bad happened to him \u2026 I would rather start in my mind, in my heart, that it was just a missing person.",
      "Former NYPD Det. Patrick Eanniello immediately headed to the Patz's home.",
      "Patrick Eanniello: And then we started to -- knock on doors. \"Anyone see this boy?\" \u2026 We worked all that day, we worked all that night. And then the following day I got home. And \u2013 I -- I was ready to break down myself.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Because?",
      "Patrick Eanniello: Because I -- I saw my son.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And he was Etan's age?",
      "Patrick Eanniello [emotional]: Uh-huh, yeah.",
      "A command center was set up in the Patz's apartment.",
      "Stan Patz|Etan's father [1979]: Both my wife and I continue to be confident that he is alive and we hope he's being cared for by someone who might want a child as adorable as he.",
      "Julie Patz [1980]: The police did not know us. We had to be cleared of suspicion as well as many other people.",
      "Etan's image was splashed on storefronts and in newspapers. Etan's father is a professional photographer and took many photos of his son. The pictures captured the public's heart\u2014and captured Etan's spirit.",
      "Julie Patz [1980]: He's just bubbling over with life and \u2026 He always saw the positive side when other people saw negative.\u00a0 He is just an incredible person.",
      "Stan Patz [1980]: Our 6-year-old boy's a loving, trusting child. \u2026We think an adult could have convinced him to come with him.",
      "The police canvassed the neighborhood, talking to people on the street and interviewing workers at a corner store near the school bus stop.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: The longer we've gone without any bad news, I think that's good.",
      "Detective Bill Butler was Eanniello's partner.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: We have leads, but we don't know where we're gonna end up on the leads that we have now.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: When you go this long on something like this, you do, you feel like you're looking for your own son.",
      "The search for Etan dragged on. Detective Butler, a father with six children, lived and breathed the case.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: How did this case influence Bill Butler?",
      "Patrick Eanniello: More than I could imagine. He was very, very tied into the case.",
      "In 1986, Bill Butler took his own life. There was speculation Butler's frustration with this case may have been part of the reason why.",
      "The search went on without Butler. Julie and Stan had two other children to protect: Etan's older sister and younger brother.",
      "Julie Patz [1980]: We keep saying we try to lead normal lives, but in so many small ways, it's just totally impossible, I mean we have his belongings all over the house \u2026 And yet to put them away is saying to us and our children he's gone and not coming back.",
      "Stan Patz [1980]: And if we are patient we'll get him back.",
      "But their patience went unrewarded.",
      "The Patz's did everything they could to keep their story in the news. And that helped other missing children.",
      "In the 1980s, milk cartons showed Etan's face, and then, those of others. But Etan remained among the missing.",
      "By 1998, a new detective was heading the Missing Persons Squad. Phil Mahony was drawn to the case by, of all things, a poem titled \"The Missing Boy\" by Sharon Olds -- about a mother and son looking at Etan's missing poster.",
      "Phil Mahony: And -- I read that poem and I said, [snaps fingers] \"That's it. \u2026I wanna work on the Etan Patz case.",
      "Phil Mahony: It was pretty much inactive and had been inactive for many years.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: It was cold?",
      "Phil Mahony: It was colder than cold \u2026 we had to find the reports and put them back together.",
      "Mahony sorted through nearly two decades worth of work\u00a0 -- and some bizarre tips.",
      "Phil Mahony: This tip about this cult in Westchester.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did that source say that Etan was -- there, at that cult?",
      "Phil Mahony: Yeah, that Etan was killed by that cult and dumped.",
      "The leads led nowhere. But, there was someone who police were very interested in: Jose Ramos, the man who said he may have encountered a boy in Washington Square Park, not far from where the Patz's lived.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did he say it was Etan Patz?",
      "Phil Mahony He has said he was 90 percent sure it was Etan Patz.",
      "A PERSON OF INTEREST?",
      "In 1982, Jose Ramos was picked up by police for stealing some books from children. He was homeless, living in a drainage tunnel in New York City. Former Lieutenant Phil Mahony recalls Ramos had some disturbing photos.",
      "Phil Mahony: He had a bunch of -- photos \u2026 of kids that looked like Etan Patz. \u2026He was -- a shady character so he enjoyed lookin' at these photos.",
      "So Ramos was questioned by investigators about the photos:",
      "ASSISTANT D.A. \u00a0FRANK CARROLL [evidence tape]: Did you ever hear of a kid named Etan Patz?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: Yeah, that was in the papers in '79.",
      "ADA FRANK CARROLL: What is about \u2026 that people say looks like Etan?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: The smile, I think.",
      "ADA FRANK CARROLL: How about the hair?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: Maybe the hair. Not that much\u2026",
      "JOSE RAMOS: Susan used to take care of him, Susan Harrington.",
      "Susan Harrington, Ramos's girlfriend, walked Etan to school during a bus strike shortly before Etan disappeared.",
      "ADA FRANK CARROLL: Did you know where he lived?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: In SoHo. Well, it was in the papers.",
      "Investigators suspected Ramos was a pedophile who could have ties to Etan.",
      "Phil Mahony: There was enough there, there was a lot there to draw attention to him certainly.",
      "Etan often played in Washington Square Park -- a place Ramos was known to visit.",
      "Phil Mahony: Jose Ramos \u2026 has said several times that on May 25, 1979 \u2026 he was here \u2026 when a young, small, sevenish \u2026 blond kid came up to him and started talkin' to him. And Jose Ramos said at that point he eventually took the kid back to his apartment.",
      "Ramos told that story to Federal Prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who had been working the case since 1985. GraBois and the FBI had, through the years, tracked leads around the world. But they always came back to Ramos.",
      "Stuart GraBois: In June 1988, Ramos was brought to my office \u2026 and proceeded to state \u2026 that he was 90 percent sure that the young boy he took that day, May 25,1979, was the same boy whose picture he saw both in the newspaper and on television\u00a0 -- \u00a0that being Etan Patz.",
      "Investigators learned Ramos had sexually molested children around the country.",
      "Stuart GraBois: One of the things he did is travel around the United States in a converted school bus, giving out Matchbox cars and toys and baseball cards to children -- to young boys to entice them onto the bus.",
      "GraBois wanted to prosecute Ramos even if it wasn't for the Etan Patz case. He succeeded in Pennsylvania. In 1990, Ramos pleaded guilty to molesting an 8-year old boy and was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: You've got a known pedophile who says he was 90 percent sure he picked up Etan Patz, you know-- around the time he disappeared. Why didn't you just go,\" OK, case closed\"?",
      "Phil Mahony: Because we didn't have that corroborated evidence -- didn't have that one person who said, \"Yeah, I saw him and Etan in Washington Square Park.\"",
      "Investigators hunted for more evidence. In 2000, Mahony ordered a search of an apartment building Ramos lived in when Etan disappeared. Ramos had allegedly told a fellow inmate this is where he disposed of Etan's body.",
      "Phil Mahony: When he was in jail, Jose Ramos said \u2026 that he put Etan into the furnace in the basement.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Of this building?",
      "Phil Mahony: Of this building, and you know, burned up the body.",
      "But like so many tips in the Etan Patz case, nothing came of it.",
      "Phil Mahony: \u2026there was just never that next thing to make you say, \"Yup, that's it. Close the books, we got the guy.\"",
      "Mahony felt they didn't have enough on Ramos to charge him with Etan's disappearance. Neither did the Manhattan D.A. at the time. But Stan Patz and Stuart GraBois were becoming more convinced Ramos was their man.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I believe this man stalked my son. I believe he lured him back to his apartment. I think he used him like toilet paper and I think he threw him away [emotional].",
      "Brian O'Dwyer is a prominent N.Y. attorney and started representing the Patz's. He was friends with Stuart GraBois, and in 2000 he approached GraBois with an idea.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: And I said, you know, you have an opportunity -- you may not have \u2026 thought about it, but of taking a civil case against Ramos.",
      "It would be a wrongful death suit. O'Dwyer hoped Ramos would be subpoenaed and might say something incriminating to help bring a criminal case. But before the wrongful death case could proceed, O'Dwyer had to ask the Patz's to officially give up hope. They would have to ask a court to declare their son dead.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: It's one of the toughest things I've ever done in my practice.",
      "And, on June 19, 2001, a judge declared that Etan Patz was officially dead.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I used to have fantasies of a taxi cab -- pulling up in front, and Etan coming out of it. But -- that was a long time ago. I don't entertain those fantasies any more.",
      "The Patz's attorney went to the Pennsylvania prison where Ramos was being held to interview the man he believed had killed Etan Patz.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: This was evil incarnate. \u2026If I had met him on the street I would have been very scared.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And what did he say?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: He said that yes, indeed, he was on the street that day. And he picked up a little boy by the name of Jimmy.",
      "This time, Ramos did not say Etan's name.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Were you convinced that Ramos was the guy?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: Absolutely.",
      "Ramos would never answer more questions or testify in court, and the Patz's won the civil case against him.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer [to reporters in 2001]: Once and for all we have a final declaration by a court of law that Jose\u00a0 Antonio Ramos caused the death of Etan Patz.",
      "It was a victory, but it was not the end of the fight.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: The ultimate objective was to get a criminal prosecution",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did you think it was enough to prosecute him criminally?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: I did.",
      "The Manhattan D.A. disagreed. He still would not charge Jose Ramos.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: He thought he couldn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Do you keep thinking about this case, or did you move on?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: No, I never moved on. Never moved on --",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Really?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: No. Jose Antonio Ramos was in prison, unpunished, for what I believed was the death of Etan Patz.",
      "But 33 years after Etan disappeared there was a tip -- and it could change everything in this case.",
      "A TURNING POINT",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I \u2013 [sighs, emotional] I think about my son every day. He's -- gone, but I will never forget him.",
      "As time passed for Stan and Julie Patz, Etan was, and is, frozen in time as a 6-year-old gone missing. They remained convinced that Jose Ramos, the pedophile who was behind bars in Pennsylvania, was responsible for Etan's death.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I send him a -- poster twice a year. \u2026and I write on the back, \"What did you do to my little boy?\"",
      "From the time Etan disappeared in 1979 until 2009, one man held the position of Manhattan District Attorney: Robert Morgenthau. He never felt there was enough evidence to indict Ramos. But Morgenthau was retiring, and Cyrus Vance Jr. was running for the office.",
      "Cyrus Vance Jr.: The Patz family reached out to me. \u2026And Stan \u2026 asked me if I would -- look into the case.",
      "And when Vance became Manhattan D.A. in 2010, he did look into it.",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: Cy Vance was like, \"Listen, we'd like to re -- you know, fresh set of eyes, relook at it, go backwards, see what was missed.\"",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman headed the Missing Persons Squad at the time, and part of the fresh look included another look at Jose Ramos.",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: We looked at the case for quite a while and I never was convinced \u2026 that there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Jose Ramos was Etan's killer.",
      "And so the search for another suspect continued.",
      "The FBI had been involved on and off since Etan's disappearance.\u00a0 In April 2012, investigators took another look at a handyman who used to work for the Patz's. Along with the NYPD, they started that dig. It was at the former site of the handyman's workshop.",
      "FBI Agent\u00a0[to reporters]: We're executing a search warrant regarding the disappearance of Etan Patz.",
      "It was not far from where the Patz's still lived.",
      "The dig went on for five days, as investigators sifted through subterranean spaces and decades-old dirt. It was starting to look like there might finally be some answers. In the end, nothing was found. The handyman was cleared. But this was not just another dead end \u2013 it was far from it. In fact, it led to the first major turning point in this case.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: The call comes into our office, onto the phone right next to my desk.",
      "It came from Jose Lopez, who called police after he watched news coverage of the dig. He said his brother-in-law might be involved in the case.",
      "Detective Dave Ramirez helped lead the investigation.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Who was his brother-in-law?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Pedro Hernandez.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Had you ever heard the name Pedro Hernandez before?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No, sir, no.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: What did he tell you about his brother-in-law?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: That he had made -- statements to various people about him having done something really bad to a child in New York.",
      "Pedro Hernandez worked as a stock boy at that corner store by the bus stop. He was 18 when Etan disappeared. And soon after, Hernandez left that job and moved home to New Jersey. \u00a0Over the years, he had been divorced, remarried and had children. He worked on and off at menial jobs and had no criminal record. But he had told people about hurting an unnamed child.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So who had Hernandez spoken to?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: There was a religious group, apparently there was a retreat that they had gone on \u2026 they all had \u2013 information \u2026 to the fact that Mr. Hernandez did something to this child.",
      "Ramirez learned Hernandez also told his ex-wife and a friend, similar stories. \u00a0Detective's notes from 1979 show police at the time knew Hernandez worked at the store, but it is unclear if he was ever questioned.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Why do you suppose he was not a suspect before?",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: I don't have the answer for it. I wasn't there. You know, I -- I never got clarity on that and I don't think he did either.",
      "About two weeks after they learned about Hernandez, on May 23, 2012, police went to his New Jersey home to talk to him.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: I had -- told him that we were investigating an old \u2026 missing persons case \u2026 in New York City. \u2026At that point, he like, he lost all the color in his face.",
      "Still, Hernandez readily agreed to go to the prosecutor's office in Camden, N.J. to be questioned.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Was it hard to get him talking?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No, no.",
      "He talked for six hours without a lawyer or a recording of the conversation. During that time, he was shown a missing poster of Etan Patz. Later, the video camera was turned on and Hernandez told them about seeing a boy outside the store where he worked:",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Can you start telling us again exactly what you just told us before, about what happened.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: He was waiting for the school bus.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Who was waiting for the school bus?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: The kid.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What's his name?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: Etan Patz.",
      "These are the words that changed the course of one of America's most heartbreaking cold cases. Hernandez went on, telling police he offered Etan a soda:",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: And then I ask him -- I ask him to go to the, in the basement with me to get the soda.",
      "It is hard to listen to his story:",
      "SECOND INVESTIGATOR: And then what happened after that?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: And then I choke him \u2026 Yeah, when I choked him he went like this [puts his hands to his throat, then goes limp and drops his arms to his side].",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What made you do this?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: I don't know.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: You don't know?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: \u2026It was something that it just happened.",
      "He signs Etan's missing poster, writing: \"I am sorry \u2026 and \"choke him\"",
      "INVESTIGATOR: And you recognize this to be the boy that you choked that day?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: Yes.",
      "After the confession, Hernandez showed investigators where he said it happened 33 years earlier.\u00a0 Lt. Zimmerman recorded the walk with his cellphone:",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So Hernandez told you here that this was the basement entrance\u2026",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So according to Hernandez, Etan was \u2026 that way from where we are.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And he lured him in -- into the basement through this door.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes, sir.",

      "Det. Dave Ramirez: And then he went down to the corner.",
      "Hernandez showed them where he says he disposed of a box with Etan's body.",
      "Police believe the box was picked up by garbage collectors. Hernandez was interviewed again hours after the SoHo walk, this time by a prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.'s office:",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to Asst. DA]: Then I choked him. And I tried to let go, but I just couldn't let him go.",
      "He repeated the same story. And later that day, Pedro Hernandez was arrested.",
      "Then-NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg [to reporters]: \u00a0We have a suspect in custody who has made a statement to the NYPD, implicating himself in the disappearance of Etan Patz, 33 years ago.",
      "Cyrus Vance Jr:\u00a0 He had confessed to killing Etan Patz. It was a credible confession.",
      "So says the prosecutor. But soon, questions were being asked about the six hours when Hernandez was questioned before the videotaping began.",
      "Richard Schlesinger [to Vance]: Why weren't those first hours videotaped?",
      "UNDER ARREST",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: It was a day or two shy of the 33rd anniversary. It was a day or two shy that we made the arrest.",
      "Then-NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly [to reporters]: This evening the NYC police department is announcing the arrest of Pedro Hernandez\u2026",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman [to reporters]: \u00a0Mr. Patz was taken aback, a little surprised and I would say\u00a0 overwhelmed.",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: You know, it had to sink in. You know, 30-something years, it had to sink in. \u2026I can't imagine not having an answer for that many years.",
      "For decades, Stan and Julie Patz believed another man was responsible for their son's disappearance in 1979.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I believe this man stalked my son. \u2026And I want him to admit it [emotional].",
      "Now, someone was admitting it. But it was Pedro Hernandez.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to investigators]: He was waiting for the school bus. \u2026then he went down the steps \u2026 when I choked him [puts his hands to his throat] he went like this [goes limp and drops arms to his side].",
      "After Hernandez was arrested, he was thought to be a suicide risk and taken to Bellevue Hospital.",

      "Harvey Fishbein is Pedro Hernandez's court-appointed attorney.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: \u2026and I walked out of there and I said, \"The man has an issue that needs to be addressed.\"",

      "A defense psychiatrist diagnosed Hernandez with a personality disorder that can leave a person unable to differentiate between what's real and what's not.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [psychiatric exam video]: I had, uh, visions.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Do you think Pedro Hernandez knows if he killed Etan Patz or not?",
      "Harvey Fishbein: I \u2013 I think he knows he didn't. And that's the-",
      "Richard Schlesinger: You think? Are you sure?",
      "Harvey Fishbein: It's hard to look into someone's mind, which is one of the real problems we have here.",
      "The diagnosis of mental illness would be a major part of Hernandez's defense. \u00a0In January 2015, two- and-a-half years after his arrest, Hernandez went on trial for the murder of Etan Patz.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Etan Patz's father walked silently past reporters in the courthouse ... finally hoping to see justice served nearly 36 years after his young son's disappearance.",
      "At trial, the defense would argue that Hernandez's mental illness made him make up the whole story of murdering Etan, starting with seeing him by the bus stop.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to investigators]: He was waiting for the school bus.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: Pedro says, \"I saw him standing there.\"",
      "Harvey Fishbein: Yet, no parent that was at the bus stop that morning who knew Etan, saw Etan that morning. \u2026So the fact that Pedro said that he saw the child there when no one else did immediately raises questions as to did this actually happen or not?",
      "Hernandez told investigators he tried to hide Etan's book bag in the store's basement.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to ADA] So I took the book bag and I threw it behind the freezer.",
      "But Fishbein says the police would have searched that store and, if they did, should have found the bag or some other evidence.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: That bag was never recovered.",
      "The defense also argued that Hernandez has a low IQ and is susceptible to suggestions.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: We -- argued to the jury that \u2026 He's unreliable because of his low intellect. \u2026because of his psychiatric condition. And \u2026 'cause the story in the end does not make sense.",
      "But the prosecution experts interviewed Hernandez and concluded he is not mentally ill, and that the jury could believe his words.",
      "Prosecutors had home videos showing Hernandez socializing like anyone else. And they pointed out that Hernandez never reported any mental illness on a driver's license renewal form he filled out.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Do you believe that he was competent to confess?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: Absolutely. \u2026I think there was ample evidence that Pedro Hernandez was not \u2013 fabricating \u2013 this -- homicide as the product of mental illness, but that he in fact was -- admitting to something that had tortured him \u2026 and he confessed.",
      "But Fishbein wants the jury to wonder what happened during those six hours before the videotaping began.",
      "INVESTIGATOR [to Hernandez]: Can you start telling us again exactly what you just told us before, about what happened?",
      "Harvey Fishbein:\u00a0 There was an affirmative decision not to videotape what was going on. All it would've taken was the pushing of a button.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Why wasn't that taped?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: I think it was not taped, because \u2026 there was no legal requirement that it be taped.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: How do you know that they didn't feed him information? How do you know they didn't berate him?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: The way you assure yourself is by talking to the witnesses who were there. \u2026 after speaking to those who were present and being informed of what happened, I did not doubt that there was anything but a fair handling of Mr. Hernandez and appropriate questioning of him.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did you give him any information about the crime when you were talking to Mr. Hernandez?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did you try and influence him?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: I wouldn't say. No.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: This was all him just talking to you, volunteering this stuff?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes.",

      "SECOND INVESTIGATOR [to Hernandez]: Right there is strength. That's the strength of the Lord.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: \"That's the strength of the Lord.\" \u2026What's the strength of the Lord? That he said something that they said they needed in order to make people feel better, the family to resolve it?",
      "Richard Schlesinger: But the police would counter and the prosecutors would counter that this guy confessed to so many people over the years that he corroborates his own words.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: Well, they-- they would like to say that. I don't think that's accurate.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: They do say that --",
      "Harvey Fishbein: I know -- and I don't think that's accurate.",
      "The prosecution called those church members, Hernandez's ex-wife, and his friend who all said Hernandez told them he did something bad to a young boy. But at the time, they never reported anything because they didn't know whether to believe him.",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: If it was one statement in isolation, that would be one thing. \u2026There were a number of people to whom he unburdened himself.",
      "But Fishbein told the jury those accounts varied and Hernandez may have been making them up to look tough. And he offered the jurors another suspect; the man many, including the Patz's, first thought killed Etan: Jose Ramos, the known pedophile whose girlfriend knew Etan.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: \u00a0I feel certain that if the District Attorney's Office tried Jose Ramos, he would be convicted.",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: The evidence against Pedro Hernandez was much stronger than it had ever been against Jose Ramos.",
      "The prosecutors had one piece of evidence they considered critical. It was something Hernandez said when he showed police where he said he dumped Etan's body. He noticed there was a door where he didn't remember one.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez:\u00a0 And he says, \"There wasn't a door there.\"",
      "When they researched the building's history, prosecutors discovered Hernandez was right. The door was added after 1979.",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: That's a fact that was not known publicly\u2026 that we believed only the killer would know.",
      "But the defense says Hernandez wasn't even sure which building it was.",
      "DETECTIVE [to Hernandez]: \u00a0Which one? Can you remember if it was this one?",
      "Harvey Fishbein: He said \u2026 \"I thought maybe this is it.\" And then he looks and he says, \"No. This is it.\"",
      "DETECTIVE: OK, this is the one, right?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: \u00a0Yeah, I think so.",

      "For 18 days, the jury considered Pedro Hernandez's confession to the murder of Etan Patz.",

      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ:\u00a0 And then I choke him.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: Yeah, when I choked him, he went like this [hold hands to his throat, drops his arms to his sides and goes limp].",
      "Adam Sirois was one of the jurors.",
      "Adam Sirois | Juror: A big bone of contention was the mental health issue. \u2026We debated that for days.",
      "Adam Sirois: The other issue that was very sticky at first was the confession \u2026 Everyone felt very upset about not being able to see the entire interview.",
      "The jurors disagreed on whether the confession could have been coerced. Twice, they told the judge they were at an impasse. And, the third time they reported they could not reach a verdict. On May 8, 2015, the judge declared a mistrial.",

      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: No. \u00a0\u2026the date was\u2026 the 25th\u2026",
      "The juror found the confession hard to believe, not knowing what went on before the camera started rolling.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: You know, it's very hard for people to wrap their minds around the idea that somebody would confess to murdering a child -- if he didn't actually do it?",
      "Adam Sirois: Yeah. \u2026 And a lot of the jurors said that in -- in our deliberations. \u2026But the whole reason why you don't just throw someone in jail when they confess is that there's a lot of people out there with mental illness that could confess to lots of crimes. And it doesn't mean they're all guilty.",
      "But rest of the jurors believed Hernandez was guilty. Still, 11 out of 12 is not enough to convict. And Stan Patz was obviously disappointed.",
      "Stan Patz [to reporters after mistrial]: This man did it. He said it. How many times does a man have to confess before someone believes him?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: \u00a0Stan was -- was unequivocal in his support that the case should be retried. And so we did.",
      "A year-and-a-half later, Pedro Hernandez went on trial again. The evidence and the issues were the same as the first trial. And, like the first trial, it was long -- more than three months. This trial also ended with a long deliberation -- nine days.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did it start feeling like the first time to you?",
      "Harvey Fishbein | Defense attorney: Nothing ever felt like that 18 days the first time. But yes. It was reminiscent of that and \u2026 we were just trying to understand what was going on. It's impossible to try to read a jury.",
      "But unlike the first trial, this jury reached a verdict. Pedro Hernandez was convicted of killing Etan Patz 37 years after the first-grader left home and vanished.",

      "Pedro Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years-to-life.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Why do you think this case was so hard to solve? Why did it take so long?",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: My opinion. \u00a0\u2026I think people had great intentions. \u2026 I think people got focused on people like Ramos. I'm not criticizing anybody independently, 'cause it made a lotta sense. \u2026He's an evil man. He's just not our evil man.",
      "It's a feeling now shared by others who once were convinced Jose Ramos murdered Etan Patz before police found Pedro Hernandez.",

    "story": [
      "The official start of fall is still months away, but the season is just around the corner for Starbucks fans.",
      "The coffee chain's popular Pumpkin Spice Latte is set to return on Aug. 26, Starbucks announced Monday. Although that's a later release date than last year, the 2025 return of the PSL is still on the earlier side for the company, which traditionally had waited until September to bring back the seasonal drink, closer to the actual start of autumn, which falls on Sept. 22 this year.",
      "The popular menu item consists of espresso, milk, Pumpkin Spice Syrup and whipped cream, with pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top. The coffee chain started adding real pumpkin to the drink in 2015.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as Starbucks' new fall menu comes at a critical juncture for Starbucks, which is pulling all of the levers it can to lure customers back into its stores. After enjoying years of strong growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as new menu items are \"cultural touchstones that spark connection, nostalgia and excitement,\" said Starbucks global chief brand officer Tressie Leiberman in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The perennial debut of the Pumpkin Spice Latte may not be enough on its own to turn around the fate of Starbucks. But if past years are any indication, it's sure to be a crowd pleaser and revenue booster.",
      "What is on Starbucks' new 2025 fall menu?",
      "Starbucks said several other fall-inspired drinks will be returning to its menu, including the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai and the Pecan Crunch Oatmilk Latte.",
      "The chain is also adding a new fall drink, called the Pecan Cortado, with Leiberman describing it as combining \"fall flavors with our bold espresso.\" Starbucks is also adding a fall menu item, Italian Sausage Egg Bites.",

      "The rise of PSL",
      "Starbucks introduced the drink in 2003 after a months-long brainstorming session to create the company's first fall beverage. Led by Peter Dukes, who is credited as the father of the drink, the group's goal was to match the success of the peppermint mocha.",
      "Little did they know it would become their most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Since debuting over 20 years ago, the Pumpkin Spice Latte, also known by its initials PSL, has skyrocketed in popularity, with hundreds of millions of beverages sold.",
      "\"Nobody knew at the beginning what it would grow to be,\" Dukes\u00a0said in a story posted on the Starbucks website for the beverage's 20-year anniversary. \"Twenty years later, it's taken on a life of its own.\"",
      "Starbucks initially considered naming the drink the fall harvest latte, but changed it to the Pumpkin Spice Latte \"because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin,\" Dukes said in a Starbucks post.",
      "The Starbucks-induced pumpkin craze led Merriam-Webster to add the \"pumpkin spice\" to the dictionary in 2022. It also prompted other chains like Dunkin' and McDonald's to introduce their own pumpkin-inspired beverages in 2007 and 2013, respectively.",

    "summary": "25 nations condemn Israel over \"drip feeding\" of aid to Palestinians and say \"the war in Gaza must end,\" just as it looks set to expand.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty-five nations, including Britain, Canada and Japan, issued a joint statement on Monday with \"a simple, urgent message: the war in Gaza must end now.\"",
      "The statement by the U.S. allies and partners across the globe and published online by the U.K. government condemns Israel's tightly-controlled aid distribution method, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children.\"",
      "\"It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid,\" said the statement, which was published after one of the deadliest days for aid seekers during the 21-month war in Gaza. Health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said more than 80 people were killed trying to access emergency food supplies on Sunday alone.",
      "In addition to the U.K., the nations that signed the joint statement were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.",
      "\"The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths. The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity,\" the statement says. \"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.\"",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-orchestrated terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Most of those captives have since been released, but Netanyahu said earlier this month that 50 remain in Gaza, including 20 he said were still alive.",
      "\"The hostages cruelly held captive by Hamas since 7 October 2023 continue to suffer terribly,\" the 25 nations said in the statement. \"We condemn their continued detention and call for their immediate and unconditional release. A negotiated ceasefire offers the best hope of bringing them home and ending the agony of their families.\"",
      "Israel does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza to report on the war, making it impossible to independently verify figures provided by the Palestinian enclave's Hamas-run health ministry and other agencies. The Israeli government rejects these numbers as falsely inflated, but the United Nations says the ministry's figure of more than 59,000 people being killed in total since the war started is the most credible information available.",
      "In a statement shared on social media, Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein said Israel rejected the joint international statement, \"as is disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas.\"",
      "CBS News' own team inside Gaza has spoken with medical workers and family members of aid seekers who say Israeli forces have routinely opened fire on people near food distribution sites since at least the end of May, when a new, controversial, U.S.- and Israeli-backed organization started operating a handful of \"humanitarian hubs\" in the enclave.",
      "The deaths reported on Sunday, near a convoy of aid trucks operated by the U.N.'s World Food Program, were not linked to the U.S.-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is run by an evangelical preacher who worked previously as an adviser to President Trump. But Palestinian authorities say most of the aid seekers killed by Israeli forces over the last month and a half were trying to access GHF hubs.",
      "GHF director Rev. Johnnie Moore told CBS News earlier this month that while he didn't \"want to diminish these reports\" about killings near GHF hubs, \"we can't control what happens outside our distribution sites.\"",
      "He repeated his previous calls \u2014 which have been echoed by the White House \u2014 for the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies to join the GHF's efforts to feed people in Gaza.",
      "None of the established humanitarian agencies that have worked for decades in Gaza have agreed to work with the GHF, saying it forces already-displaced Palestinians to trek for miles to reach its hubs and that it violates basic humanitarian principles.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF in early July: $30 million in funding.",
      "In a statement on Monday, COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of affairs in the Palestinian territories, said: \"Israel acts in accordance with international law and is leading efforts to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in coordination with the international organizations.\"",
      "Israel has blamed Hamas for all deaths in Gaza since the war began, accusing it of using civilians as human shields and of seizing aid materials for its own use, both of which the group \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 denies doing.",
      "Pope Leo XIV also renewed his call over the weekend for \"an immediate end to the barbarity of this war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict\" in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu has said repeatedly that the war will continue until Hamas is rendered impotent militarily and politically, and all the hostages are returned.",
      "The international outcry and mounting demands for an immediate ceasefire come at a time when there's little to suggest any imminent breakthrough in ongoing negotiations for a truce. They come instead as Israel says it is again expanding its ground war in Gaza, forcing thousands of Palestinians to once again flee for safety.",
      "Israel warns of new ground operation in central Gaza",
      "On Sunday, Israel widened its evacuation orders for Gaza to include an area that has been somewhat less hard-hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians into ever tinier areas.",
      "In an Arabic language social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",
      "\"For your safety, evacuate the area immediately and move south,\" the IDF said.",
      "The U.N.'s humanitarian agency OCHA estimated that between 50,000 and 80,000 people were in the area under the new evacuation order, and families were seen carrying what few items they could on donkey carts, bicycles and even dragging sleds behind them as they headed south.",
      "Deir el-Balah resident Abdullah Abu Saleem, 48, told the French news agency AFP that \"during the night, we heard huge and powerful explosions shaking the area as if it were an earthquake,\" which he attributed to \"artillery shelling in the south-central part of Deir el-Balah and the southeastern area.\"",
      "\"We are extremely worried and fearful that the army is planning a ground operation in Deir el-Balah, and the central camps where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltering,\" he told AFP.",
      "The Israeli military did not provide immediate comment on the operations, but the GLZ Radio network, which is funded by the Israeli government and affiliated directly with the IDF, reported Monday that soldiers had, \"for the first time since the start of the war,\" entered Deir al-Balah on the ground.",
      "GLZ said a single combat brigade, \"including engineering and armor forces, have recently entered a maneuver in the southern Deir al-Balah area in the central camps in the Gaza Strip. The attacks were preceded by air and artillery strikes during the night and morning, and in the afternoon the forces went into action.\"",
      "The announced expansion of ground operations drew a quick statement of concern from the group that represents the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2013 the precise whereabouts of whom remain unknown.",
      "\"The families demand that the Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Chief of Staff, and IDF Spokesperson appear before them and the Israeli public this evening to clearly explain why the offensive in the Deir al-Balah area does not put the hostages at serious risk,\" the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement. \"As of this moment, we have received no official, organized updates or satisfactory answers on this matter. The people of Israel will not forgive anyone who knowingly endangered the hostages \u2014 both the living and the deceased. No one will be able to claim they didn't know what was at stake.\"",

According to the military and a fire official, the Chinese-made F-7 BGI aircraft crashed into the campus of Milestone School and College, in the Uttara neighborhood, in the afternoon as students were attending classes.",

      "A desperate scene unfolded after the crash. Local residents and rescuers carried wounded students on their laps, while worried parents ran frantically.

    "summary": "At least 85 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in one of the deadliest days for aid-seekers since the war began, Gaza's Health Ministry said.",
    "story": [
      "At least 85 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid at locations across Gaza on Sunday, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said, in one of the deadliest days yet for aid-seekers in over 21 months of war.",
      "There was new alarm as Israel's military issued evacuation orders for areas of central Gaza, one of the few areas where it has rarely operated with ground troops and where many international organizations attempting to distribute aid are located.",
      "The largest toll was in northern Gaza, where at least 67 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid entering through the Zikim crossing with Israel, according to the Health Ministry and local hospitals. The U.N. World Food Program said 25 trucks with aid had entered for \"starving communities\" when it encountered massive crowds that came under gunfire. It called violence against aid-seekers \"completely unacceptable.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-based organization that has been distributing aid in the territory, said in a statement Sunday that its workers were \"deeply saddened by reports that more than 30 people were killed while trying to access food from a U.N. convoy at the Zikim crossing in Northern Gaza as humanitarian efforts face escalating violence.\" The foundation said it distributed 31,968 boxes of aid throughout the day at two distribution sites.",
      "Some witnesses said Israel's military shot into the crowd at the Zikim crossing. The Israel Defense Forces said they \"fired warning shots in order to remove an immediate threat.\"",
      "\"Suddenly, tanks surrounded us and trapped us as gunshots and strikes rained down. We were trapped for around two hours,\" said Ehab Al-Zei, who had been waiting for flour. \"I will never go back again. Let us die of hunger, it's better.\"",
      "Nafiz Al-Najjar, who was injured, said tanks and drones targeted people \"randomly\" and he saw his cousin and others shot dead.",
      "Israel's military said soldiers had shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza who posed a threat, and it was aware of some casualties. But it said the numbers reported by officials in Gaza were far higher than its initial investigation found.",
      "The military said it was attempting to facilitate the entry of aid, and accused Hamas militants of creating chaos and endangering civilians.",
      "More than 150 people were wounded overall, with some in critical condition, hospitals said. Separately, seven Palestinians were killed while sheltering in tents in Khan Younis in the south, including a 5-year-old boy, according to the Kuwait Specialized Field Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The killings in northern Gaza didn't take place near aid distribution points associated with the recently created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.- and Israel-backed group. Witnesses and health workers say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire while trying to access the group's aid distribution sites.",
      "The new evacuation orders cut access between the central city of Deir al-Balah and the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis in the narrow territory. The military also reiterated evacuation orders for northern Gaza.",
      "The United Nations has been in contact with Israeli authorities to clarify whether U.N. facilities in the southwestern part of Deir al-Balah are included in the evacuation order, according to a U.N. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. The official said that in previous instances, U.N. facilities were spared from evacuation orders.",
      "The latest order covers an area stretching from a previously evacuated area all the way to the Mediterranean coast and will severely hamper movement for aid groups and civilians in Gaza.",
      "Military spokesman Avichay Adraee called for people to head to the Muwasi area, a desolate tent camp on Gaza's southern coast that Israel's military has designated a humanitarian zone.",
      "The announcement came as Israel and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks in Qatar, but international mediators say there have been no breakthroughs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted that expanding Israel's military operations in Gaza will pressure Hamas in negotiations.",
      "Also on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire, urging the international community to respect international laws and protect civilians in the wake of an Israeli attack on Gaza's only Catholic church last week, which killed three people and wounded 10 others, including the priest.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel's military said it controlled more than 65% of Gaza.",
      "Gaza's population of more than 2 million Palestinians are in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, now relying largely on the limited aid allowed into the territory. Many people have been displaced multiple times.",
      "Hamas triggered the war when militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Most of the hostages or their remains have been released through various deals, while 50 remain in Gaza, but fewer than half are thought to be alive.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed more than 58,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't say how many militants have been killed but says more than half of the dead have been women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas government, but the U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",
      "The Hostages Family Forum, a grassroots organization that represents many families of hostages, condemned the new evacuation announcement and demanded that Netanyahu and Israel's military explain what they hope to accomplish in central Gaza, accusing Israel of operating without a clear plan.",
      "\"Enough! The Israeli people overwhelmingly want an end to the fighting and a comprehensive agreement that will return all of the hostages,\" the forum said. On Saturday night, during a weekly protest, tens of thousands marched in Tel Aviv to the branch of the U.S. Embassy, demanding an end to the war.",
      "Ambulances in front of three major hospitals in Gaza sounded their alarms simultaneously Sunday morning in an urgent appeal as the hunger crisis grows. The Health Ministry posted pictures on social media of doctors holding signs about malnourished children and the lack of medication.",
      "A ministry spokesperson, Zaher al-Wahidi, said at least nine children under 5 years old have died of malnutrition since Israel imposed a blockade on the entry of aid in March. The blockade was partially eased in May.",
      "He said tracking malnutrition deaths is difficult because some people might be suffering from other medical conditions that could be compounded with severe hunger.",

Ukrainian and Spanish media say Ihor Hrushevskyi's body was found late last month at the same apartment complex where a Russian military helicopter pilot-turned-defector was gunned down in February of 2024.",
      "El Espa\u00f1ol newspaper's edition for the Alicante region in southeast Spain said it had interviewed at least 20 residents of the Cala Alta apartment complex, where neighbors found the 61-year-old Ukrainian floating face-down in the pool on June 29.",
      "The newspaper cited local authorities as saying there were no apparent signs of a violent attack, but that foul play was not being ruled out as the investigation proceeded. They said a medical crisis, such as a stroke or heart failure, could have been a factor, but told the newspaper that the death appeared suspicious.",
      "Many residents of the resort, which is popular with Russian and Ukrainian expats, told El Espa\u00f1ol they weren't even aware of the death until reporters came asking questions. The paper said its efforts to dig up personal information on Hrushevskyi were challenging, which it put down to the nature of his former employment in Ukraine.",
      "\"The confidentiality inherent in one of the Ukrainian government's elite units turns Ihor into a ghost, with no trace in official documents or public information,\" El Espa\u00f1ol said.",
      "According to the newspaper, Hrushevskyi moved to the Cala Alta apartment complex about 16 months before he was found dead.",
      "Ukraine's Pravda daily newspaper also reported that Hrushevskyi had worked as a senior official at the Interior Ministry's Department for Combating Organized Crime during the 1990s. Russia's state-run TASS news agency also reported the details of the story, citing El Espa\u00f1ol's report.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities on the death, though the foreign ministry was quoted by national public broadcaster Suspilne as saying the Ukrainian consulate in Spain was handling the repatriation of Hrushevskyi's body.",
      "His body was discovered about a year and a half after police found the bullet-riddled remains of former Russian military helicopter pilot Maksim Kuzminov in the parking garage of the same apartment complex in Villajoysa \u2014 a town on the Mediterranean coast whose name means \"joyful village.\"",
      "Kuzminov, who was killed at the age of 28, first made headlines in his home region when he defected from Russia, flying his Mi-8 helicopter below radar in August 2023 across the border into Ukraine.",
      "He handed over the helicopter, sensitive military equipment and top secret Russian intelligence to Ukrainian authorities before appearing on Ukrainian television and calling the war launched by President Vladimir Putin \"a genocide of Ukrainian people.\"",
      "Just days after he was killed, Russian state news agencies quoted Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service, as calling Kuzminov a \"traitor and criminal\" who had become \"a moral corpse at the very moment when he planned his dirty and terrible crime.\"",
      "Naryshkin did not confirm or deny Russian involvement in the former pilot's murder, but months earlier, Russian state TV said the GRU intelligence agency had \"been given the order\" to eliminate Kuzminov.",
      "CBS' 60 Minutes reported last year that the Ukrainian government gave Kuzminov about $500,000 and a new Ukrainian identity, and officials warned him not to leave the country due to the threat of possible retaliation by Russia.

      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Director Lyons, thank you so much for your time.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT TODD LYONS: Oh, appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thanks for coming.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You are leading the agency that is at the center of President Trump's top domestic policy agenda, immigration enforcement and cracking down on illegal immigration. How do you see ICE's role in this administration?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Well, I think, definitely, I see it as a law enforcement tool, right? So ICE is really focused on its public safety mission. I think under all administrations, that what ICE truly is, it's a law enforcement entity. And I really think right now, our main focus is public safety, and that's- that's my focus. The main focus is to keep American people safe and to enact our law enforcement mission.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 The administration has set a goal of carrying out about a million deportations per year annually. Congress just gave your agency $45 billion just to fund its detention network, and also another $30 billion to boost deportation efforts. What exactly will that money fund, and what do we expect that to look on the ground?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 On the ground, what we're really focused on is definitely hiring more in our ranks. In order to achieve the President's mission, and under Secretary Noem's vision, we definitely need more officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 We're looking to hire about 10,000 and- but that's we've been depleted over the past four years. Our ranks have really shrunk, and we really don't have enough to do law enforcement mission. One of the big hampers for us is with the increase in sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies, we have to send more officers and agents out into the community, out on the street. Where we'd only take us two agents, say, going into a secure facility or a police station, county jail to arrest a public safety threat, well, we have to send out four to five agents, and with the increase of assaults on officers, we sometimes have to send out eight to ten just to provide security for those officers that are making the arrest. So that's one of the big things that we're looking forward to with this increased funding is increasing our manpower. Not only just officers, but our attorneys as well, to ensure that we have enough of legal support to go ahead and deal with the Department of Justice, immigration court appeals, things like that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Detention facilities too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Detention facility as well, yeah.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Is the goal of 1 million deportations per year now possible because of this money?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I definitely think it's possible. One thing though, that ICE is historically known for in our mission is we detain to remove, we don't detain punitively. So people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for long-term. We, you know, it's- we detain people to remove them. So what we want to do, too, is focus on the removal efforts as well, because one thing we want to do is remove people in a safe, humane manner, but also efficiently as well, quickly. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by immigration judge. We want to ensure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 You know, I honestly have to say, I think it's just the increased rhetoric that we hear against ICE officers and the ICE mission. If we think back to when you and I did a ride along last year, in October. You know, you and I spent a good amount of time together observing teams in the field, and you didn't see the officers and agents that day masked up, right? You didn't see any kind of violence towards us, any protests. Even going back to January 20, beginning of this administration, up until the middle of February, you really didn't see that kind of rhetoric or violence coming against ICE officers and agents like you do now. I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against the ICE law enforcement mission, is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. And that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taken it to the next level. We've seen protests. We've seen rocks. Rocks, in itself, could be a deadly weapon, but now we have individuals laying in ambush with firearms to attack an ICE facility. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830% increase from last year assaults on officers. That's what really keeps me up at night, is because we have to focus on the men and women of ICE, keeping them safe, making sure they go home to their families, our other partners, as well as the people in the community we interact with. You know, someone might interject themselves into this arrest of someone that's wanted for, say, a murder in their home country, a violent felon who has nothing to lose. And one of these people, agitators or protesters, might get involved in an ICE law enforcement arrest, and they could get injured as well. So there's a lot of factors that really come with this rhetoric against ICE officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks, too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was- recently, people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails--",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: --in the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of- lot of lack of cooperation. So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension, kind of like you said, the immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it. So I think that's also leading to a lot of the, you know, the rhetoric, the criticism, and just a lot more of the increased violence on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 And you have cited those concerns about officer safety when defending your agents wearing masks during operations. That has become a polarizing debate. What do you say, director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves, and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, and that's one of our biggest concerns, and I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it. I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. If you see a lot of the photos, like we were out that day, like I would go back to our ride along. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners in local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vest. You can see the HSI, ERO, federal police officer, FBI on the back of the vest. So I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves. Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do doxx or threaten an ICE officer or agent or their family. I think that's key. If we- if we had that kind of support and had those laws or regulations in place, that we can hold those folks accountable to give ICE agents and officers and other law enforcement officers the peace of mind that someone that does threaten their life or their families or doxxes them will be held accountable. I think that'd go a long way.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 So you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay, what is the policy regarding that? It's not mandatory.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's not mandatory. As you see- I don't know, I wasn't with your ride-along yesterday, but if you see some of the media coverage, there are officers and agents that don't. Recently, there's been some officers that have been interviewed by other networks who- who've talked about the fears and some of the issues with the job. So there are some that don't, but there are some that have been severely doxxed. You know, speaking from experience, last administration I had multiple protesters from antifa show up at my residence. My address has been put out there. My family's information has been put out there. So I know firsthand what these men and women go through, and it's a scary experience for someone's family, because as a law enforcement officer, you don't sign up for that. You don't bring- you don't bring the work home to your job. But when you have folks, or even elected officials saying that there's going to be no rest for an ICE officer, an agent, that we're going to expose them, you know, no rest for their family. That really concerns me.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's get into who ICE is arresting.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Sure.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally, but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, we- we- like I said from the get go, and even, again, going back to when we were together in October, ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio, meaning that if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction or wanted in their home country, and an ICE officer finds other individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well. We are still focused on the worst of the worst. More than half the individuals we have in custody right now have either a conviction or pending criminal charges, since they're released from a sanctuary jurisdiction. One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records aren't in U.S. data systems. So when we do go out and say, arrest someone that has an Interpol Red Notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal, but under the American judicial state, they don't have an American criminal history, but that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country. I think that's one of the statistic that kind of gets lost in someone and they say, well, this person is non criminal- he doesn't have a criminal history in the United States. Well, that individual can have a criminal history, say, in Brazil, Uruguay, Ukraine, Russia. So there's a lot too that goes into that, what ICE offices and agents do arrest people for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And you're saying that now, if your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: They're so-called collateral arrests.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay. We just, as you mentioned, rode along with Border- not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worst of the worst who are in the country illegally. But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases, farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally, but also are violent offenders?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes, that's one thing, and that's one thing I'm extremely focused on since I became the acting director, is the fact that the president and Secretary Noem have made a promise to the American public that ICE is going to focus on the worst of the worst, and that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start. What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say, that- that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody. In regards to the work site, like you mentioned, one thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6 in LA, is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you- we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally and that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: 100%.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It is- it is. I can definitely see that concern, but what I would say is that we have to hold these American businesses accountable, especially when it comes to human trafficking, or child trafficking, forced labor, because those are victims, right? That, you know, that's where illegal employment isn't just a victimless crime, it's a victim at the end of that being exploited. And these American companies do exploit individuals who come here illegally just to make an extra dollar, and that's just not right. We have to hold those county- companies accountable.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Should anyone here illegally now be scared of ICE agents potentially arresting them? Should that be something that they should be worried about?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No- I- what I can- I can speak for with ICE is, we've always done targeted enforcement. That's one thing I- I always stress. You saw it when you- when you and I rode together in Baltimore last year. ICE knows who they're going after that day. There are other DHS entities, Border Patrol has a different mission, CBP has a different mission than us. I can't speak to them, but I will speak to ICE, and the fact that, when ICE does go out, the person we're looking for, it- has a criminal record, has been released from a jail, that's considered a public safety threat, or has been ordered lawfully removed from the United States by an immigration judge. That's another one of our big things as well. But again, to go back to my point earlier, if we do go out--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Who may not be criminals, but have been ordered deported.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah. Ordered deported. There are millions of people that are here in the United States that have had their due process, went through the entire immigration process, and have been lawfully ordered deported by a Department of Justice immigration judge, and have just not left the country. We are focused on them as well. But again, to go back to what I said earlier, if we go ahead and go out into the community, and we do effectuate an arrest of one of those individuals, but there might be two or three other individuals with that person that's here illegally, we're just not going to walk away like we did in the past. We are going to, you know, conduct our law enforcement mission and arrest those individuals.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: I want to read you, Director, a letter that Congressman Tony Gonzales and other Republicans wrote to you, actually. They said, \"every minute that we spend pursuing an individual with a clean record is a minute less that we dedicate on apprehending terrorists or cartel operatives.\" Isn't that just objectively true from an operational standpoint, because you don't have the agents and facilities, perhaps, to detain everyone who is here illegally?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I would say that. Operationally, I've always said we do have limited resources. Now we are going to get that funding with the president's Big Beautiful Bill. To the congressman, I would say that ICE is still focused on going after terrorists. We've- we've- you know, arrested over 3,000 TDA gang members, which is now a foreign terrorist organization. But much- what I would say is, much like any local law enforcement agency, if you pull somebody over in a vehicle, and that person has a misdemeanor warrant, say, or a civil warrant, that local law enforcement agency isn't going to walk away from that individual. They're going to arrest that individual. And it's the same with ICE. So while we still are going out after the rapists, murderers, terrorists, we are going to encounter individuals that are here illegally. But what I can promise is, our main focus is those public safety threats, are those national security concerns, because that's what ICE's mission is. Now we are going to encounter those other people which are listed as collaterals, but we just can't walk away from them. We need to do our law enforcement mission as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You're not ignoring those cases anymore.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: On worksite enforcement, there have been some mixed messages, if you will, from the administration. Initially, there was an effective pause on arrests at hotels, restaurants, and farms. That was quickly reversed. The president has talked about, Director, giving a pass to farmers who are in the country with workers who are here illegally. What is the policy now, when it comes to immigration worksite enforcement?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Which is- kind of what I said earlier in the interview, is the fact that work- when we do a worksite enforcement, it's based on a criminal case. So ICE is still going to focus on a criminal case, whether that be, like you saw on the marijuana grow farm in California, whether it be suspected human trafficking or child forced labor, issues like that. So our policy is still, if we're going to worksite enforcement, we are focused on that criminal aspect of the investigation. So that's what ICE's policy is. I can't speak to the administration. I don't want to get ahead of the president or secretary when it comes to any type of long term immigration plan they do have for the workers, but I will say for ICE, our policy is, we're still going to build solid criminal cases on those worksites to include the businesses, and that's what we're focused on.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Including farms, hotels and restaurants?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, we have seen, in many instances, where certain organizations do exploit labor like that, whether it be child labor, human trafficking, things like that. We can't walk away from a criminal case when it comes to real victims there, we'll still focus on those. Now administratively, I- we're gonna focus more heavily on the criminal side of that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: But there's no ban on enforcement operations at certain work sites?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No. And I think, like I said, you'll see, when we show up at a work site, it's because a signed federal judge warrant has brought us there for a criminal reason.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Like in the case of the cannabis farms in California?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller, who plays a major role on immigration policy in this administration, has talked about ICE carrying out at least 3,000 daily arrests. Right now, you are not hitting that number. Is that target realistic? And can you get to it just by apprehending criminals?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I- if you look at the amount of criminals that we've already arrested, I think you see we can. I think when you look at those larger numbers, when people talk about those certain goals, you have to also look at those individuals that do have those final orders of removals. Those are what we're really focused on as well. There was many people that were let in the last administration that have gone through their immigration process, who have not shown up for immigration court and have been ordered deported. We still have to focus on those. So I would still say that you're going to see what ICE resources going out daily will be still those criminal cases and those final orders.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Can you get to that 3,000 number per day?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think operationally, we can get to any number we set our- set our mind on. I think we just need to be limited in our scope, and use our limited resources to focus on the worst of the worst. I- you know, operationally, when we're trying to protect the American public, I can't be focused on a number. We have to be focused on, number one, getting those public safety threats and those national security threats out of the country, like we did just recently, when we arrested some of those Iranians. There were potential, known, suspected terrorists that came in on the last administration. And we also had to worry about the safety of the men and women of ICE as well. Those are the two main focus that I need to focus on, on our daily operations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know what the current daily arrest average is right now?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I wouldn't say this daily arrest average. It just really depends on size and scope of what we're doing nationwide. It can go anywhere from 2,500 to 1,700 a day.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Got it, okay. Our colleague Margaret Brennan recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violence offenses. For example, fewer than 1% had homicide convictions. What do you make of that data?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: What I make of that is the fact that we can't look at it just based on the violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that has just been arrested, say, for DUI. Well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone that's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the larger scale of what specific crimes are. You know, whether it's a rape, a homicide, of course, you want to get those worst of the worst. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community, into here illegally, we need to focus on that. So what I focus on is ensuring that those individuals that have committed a crime are the first ones we're focused on, and that's who we are going to remove.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you know, Director, the Supreme Court recently allowed third-country deportations to continue. Should we expect those deportations to increase in the near future? And are other countries, additional nations, now stepping up and saying, I will take back people who are not my citizens?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, I would say you'd see that. But what I'd go back to is the fact that safe third-country removals has been a part of the Immigration Nationality Act for decades. This isn't something that's new, ICE has always done this, so obviously it's come to the forefront now, because, as we talked about earlier, immigration enforcement is at the forefront of the President's administration. But this has been part of the Immigration Nationality Act, which has been enacted by Congress for decades. So we've been doing this for years. That's been part of one of ICE's tools to remove individuals from these recalcitrant countries that just won't take anyone back. Prime example, if we had a country that won't take a homicide suspect back, and under the Supreme Court ruling of Zadvydas, we don't hold punitively, so we can only hold someone for six months to effectuate their removal. If their country won't take them back, we have to release this rapist and murderer back into the community. What Congress did under the Immigration Nationality Act, when enacting the Safe Third Country Agreement, gives us an option to remove these offenders back to a country that will take them.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you will continue those deportations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: We will continue those deportations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: To countries like South Sudan, for example.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Does it make sense to send people to countries where they have no ties, though? Even if they are convicted criminals.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, I would say, is I- my main focus, like I said, is the safety and security in the United States. Why would we let child rapists with a propensity of violence back into the community, because their home nation won't take them, when they're not here lawfully, or they have no right to stay here. That's our focus. Is to make sure that we are removing these individuals from the country in the most effective and meaningful way that we can. And if their home country won't take them back, then we need to seek other options, other than letting them just roam in the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: The Associated Press, director, just reported that ICE now has access to the personal information of millions of people enrolled in Medicaid, including names and addresses. Can you confirm that that is true? And if so, what does ICE plan to do with that information?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: You know, one thing that we have seen is the fact that under the last administration, we have so many known got-aways, or individuals that came into the United States and just totally disappeared off the grid. What ICE is doing is working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for, whether it be data from the Department of Labor, data from health and service- Health and Human Services, Medicaid, we are using that data to try to locate, again, the worst of the worst, those people that have been lawfully deported. So I think that's what you're going to see that data used for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 To identify and arrest people who are here illegally.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's talk about Alligator Alcatraz. Florida just opened a facility, as you know, in the Everglades, that is holding people awaiting deportation because they're here illegally. Some of them have committed crimes. How much of that facility is designed to help you operationally versus to send the message? That message being, if you're here illegally, you could potentially be sent to this scary-sounding place like Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's more of an operational. State of Florida had partnered with us for that. We had limited, we had limited space in Florida, obviously. What I would say is that we don't have the detention space capacity to remove people. Partnering with states like this definitely does help us. It is an operational need for us, is to have those partnerships with states, especially a state like Florida that does have the 287(g) agreement, where their local, State and County deputies are deputized to be ICE officers who are encountering these individuals. That definitely helps us in the- in the mission of removing individuals from the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you underscore, there have been some growing tensions in some communities because of ICE enforcement actions. Do you think there's any way, Director, to de-escalate the situation, and can you carry out the mass deportation operation that the President has promised without losing the trust of many in the public?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think one of the main things for us is that open line of communication, interviews like this, actually people looking at what ICE is doing, us highlighting these criminal offenders that we are arresting. I think a key thing too, is working with elected officials to come to common ground, to really focus on the safety of neighborhoods and communities, and really focus on what ICE does in their law enforcement mission, and totally take out the rhetoric of what's being said right now, and just really focus on that ICE is a viable law enforcement partner that does a significant public safety mission for the United States. I think that's very key in keeping these open line of communications, and working with local and state government- governments and elected officials to ensure that we are removing these public safety threats from their communities.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Director, is there something I didn't ask you that you wanted to underscore?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No, I just really liked- appreciate you taking the time to come here, and let me highlight exactly what the ICE mission is. And I just appreciate the opportunity to have that conversation.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: All right. Thank you, Director.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Appreciate it, thanks.",

      "A cargo ship lying at the bottom of the sea off the Belgian coast has been fitted with a new treasure chest: a stash of rare flat oysters.",
      "Molluscs have mostly disappeared from the North Sea due to human activity, including overfishing.",
      "Now, a Belgian project is trying to reintroduce it in a move scientists believe will help boost other marine species.",
      "\"We have to bring them back because they are essential elements in our marine ecosystems,\" Vicky Stratigaki, an engineer working on the restoration project, told AFP.",
      "In mid-July, a load of 200,000 oyster larvae attached to biodegradable materials was deposited about 100 feet under the sea in the ship's hull.",
      "The environmental project, named Belreefs, aims to turn the wreckage into a biodiversity sanctuary.",
      "Flat oysters form reefs that purify water and that other sea animals, from fish to algae, use as breeding and feeding grounds, explained Stratigaki.",
      "\"There is a lot of predation in the sea, it's a wild environment,\" she said, with about 30,000 of the oyster larvae expected to survive their first year at sea. \"Then they will start reproducing, extending the reef and also supporting the biodiversity of the reef.\"",
      "The laying of the oyster stash is the culmination of two years' work for the Belgian government project, which is supported by European Union funding.",
      "\"Until around the 1850s, the North Sea and the European waters were full of these oyster reefs,\" Stratigaki explained.",
      "Then overfishing, the spreading of an imported parasite called Bonamia and \"climatic adverse effects\" caused them to disappear, she said.",
      "The 1906 wreckage, located about 20 miles off the coastal city of Ostend, was selected to house the pilot as fishing and other disruptive activities are banned around it.",
      "\"In Belgium every wreck that is for more than one hundred years on the sea bottom gets protected automatically as cultural heritage, because it's nice for divers to go there,\" said Merel Oeyen, a marine environment expert at the Belgian ministry of health. \"It's also a hot spot for biodiversity.\"",
      "A 2023 paper published in BioScience found that shipwrecks provide important ecological resources for a wide variety of organisms, from tiny microbes to large marine creatures.",
      "\"Small fish and mobile crustaceans often find shelter in the crevices of the sunken material, and larger baitfish and predators use shipwrecks as feeding grounds and rest stops as they swim from one place to another,\" according to NOAA, which helped conduct the study.",
      "However, scientists also warned shipwreck can also cause damage to existing marine life in the area, or carry harmful cargo, such as oil.",
      "Still, the study's author, Avery Paxton, said shipwrecks can have \"second lives\" as homes to a variety of marine life.",
      "\"A ship's transformation from an in-service vessel into a thriving metropolis for marine life has a fairy-tale quality to it,\" Paxton said in an article published by The Washington Post after the study was released.",

      "The disturbing footage caused an uproar in the country, with activists demanding swift justice and a stop to so-called honor killings, in which family members target women who don't follow local traditions and culture or decide to marry someone of their choosing.",
      "The video, which surfaced over the weekend on social media and was viewed by The Associated Press, showed a man executing the young couple at close range in daylight as others stood by. Police confirmed the authenticity of the footage, saying the killings happened in the Deghari district in the province of Balochistan, said Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti.",
      "In the video, several men arrive in pickup trucks in a mountainous region, and a young woman, speaking the local language, says she is legally married.",

      "Local police identified the bride and groom only as Bano Bibi and Ahsan Ullah and released some of the suspects' names, saying the provincial government had initiated the investigation as none of the couple's family members came forward.",
      "\"The bravery shown by the slain woman is both humbling and remarkable, as she neither begged for her life nor showed any weakness,\" said Farhatullah Babar, a Pakistani human rights activist. He condemned the couple's killing and called for strict punishment for everyone involved in the \"brutal murder of the newlywed couple.\"",
      "A tribal elder, Sardar Satakzai, ordered the couple killed after the bride's brother complained she married without his consent, said police chief, Naveed Akhtar. Both were among the 11 arrested in a series of raids and authorities were looking for nine more suspects, he said.",

Franky Pasuna Sihombing, chief of the Manado navy base.",
      "A coast guard ship, six rescue vessels and several inflatable boats were deployed in the rescue operation, Sihombing said. The crews pulled many people from the sea and took them to nearby islands, and local fishermen also saved some survivors wearing life jackets as they were drifting in the choppy waters.",
      "Photos and videos circulated on social media showed terrified passengers, mostly wearing life jackets, jumping into the sea as orange flames and black smoke billowed from the burning vessel.",
      "The search and rescue operation was continuing, though there were no immediate reports of people still missing. Authorities previously said five people had died, but the National Search and Rescue Agency revised it to three early Monday after two passengers initially reported as dead were saved in a hospital, including a 2-month-old baby whose lungs were filled with seawater.",
      "The fire that began in the ferry's stern was extinguished within an hour, Sihombing said. The ferry's manifest initially registered only 280 passengers and 15 crew members, but the national rescue agency confirmed 568 survivors had been rescued and three bodies recovered, including a pregnant woman.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We turn now to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Good morning, Madam Mayor.",
      "LOS ANGELES MAYOR KAREN BASS:\u00a0 Good morning, good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad you can hear me. We are looking at immigration issues six months in. You have had such a firsthand experience out in LA, given the deployment of U.S. troops. The President ordered the early release of nearly half of the National Guard from LA. Have they departed yet? What are the remaining ones doing?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, I believe they've departed, but they were never needed in the first place, and the remaining ones are doing what they were doing all along, which is essentially protecting two federal buildings, one of which in Westwood, where there never has been a big protest against the immigration raids. This is just such an incredible misuse of, not only taxpayers money, but of the young people who are in the National Guard, who have had to leave their families, their jobs and their education for this deployment that is completely unnecessary. 4,000 troops, my understanding, is, most of their time has been spent in complete boredom, playing video games and essentially waiting around. Because again, 4,000 deployed, and about 200 actually used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The White House, of course, argues they deployed them because there was interference with the operations of law enforcement in carrying out some of the roundups. There are still enforcement actions by ICE taking place. You have talked about your objections, as you described them to \"masked men, unmarked cars, drawing guns, snatching people off the street.\" You filed a Freedom of Information request to quote, \"know who these masked men are.\" Why, though, is their identity important to you? Do you plan to prosecute them?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, no, let me just explain, because you have people who are literally walking down the street, sitting at bus stops, are individual vendors selling fruit on the street. These masked men pull up in unmarked cars and jump out of the cars with rifles and detain people. So for the average citizen, it looks like it's a violent kidnapping. So you should never have that. They don't identify themselves. And furthermore, to your previous guest, how on earth do they know that they're a threat when they're just chasing random people through parking lots at Home Depots, going to car washes and rounding up people. It's difficult to get your car washed in Los Angeles now, because most of the car washes, the employees won't come to work out of fear that a raid will take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the acting director says that his agents, some of them fear that their families will be retaliated against, and that's why they are covering their faces, that they do wear markings for the agencies that they work with. How do you respond?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, well, first of all, let me just tell you that the masked men are not from Los Angeles, and so how their families could be retaliated against. And then what is that to say to local law enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department, none of whom are ever masked who always identify themselves and even hand someone a business card. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. And I don't know, but I have a hard time believing that the woman selling pineapples on the corner is going to attack an ICE agent. And then when he says that there's identification, the problem is many of these men are in plain clothes with vests on that say 'police,' it looks like something that they could have gotten online. I think it's really important to point out the extreme nature of the randomness. And you know, Homan has said, he's mentioned a number of criteria for why they stop people. One of the points of criteria is physical appearance. Los Angeles is 3.8 million people, and about 50% of our population is Latino, so I guess that means 50% of Los Angeles could be possible suspects in an immigration raid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Tom Homan has- Tom Homan has said physical description cannot be the sole factor for reasonable suspicion, but things like location, occupation, physical appearance add up, particularly if a person runs away, or if there's a tattoo or something. You don't seem to believe that.",
      "MAYOR BASS: Location, sitting at a- well, location, sitting at a bus stop, walking down the street, selling fruit? No, I do dispute that, absolutely. And you know, again, the National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. We did not ask for them. This is the federal seizure of power from a governor deploying the National Guard when the National Guard were not even needed. We had protests at the end of the- at the end of the peaceful protest, there absolutely was some violence and some looting and vandalism, we brought that completely under control. The troops have never been involved in crowd control, never involved in the protest. They have been guarding a building. Our police department and our sheriff's department are the ones that brought the protests, when it devolved into violence, under control. We never needed the National Guard in the first place. This is a political stunt, a terrible misuse of taxpayers' dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's more we could talk about here but I want to ask you about fires, because we are now officially in fire season. It was just six months ago we saw those blazes in LA, you fired the then fire chief for you said a failure to prepare. But you still don't have a permanent fire chief in that role. Isn't that a problem? Are you prepared?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 No, no, I don't think that that's a problem at all. Our interim fire chief has 40 years of experience. In fact, he had just recently retired. I called him in, out of retirement, during the fires. He was doing the emergency operation center. So he stepped in, didn't miss a beat by taking over the fire department. And we are prepared. We do know that it's fire season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is your plan to keep him in place since you brought him out of retirement?--",
      "MAYOR BASS: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--put him in an interim basis?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 I'm sorry, no, we're doing a national search, and he is certainly open to apply. But the nation's second-largest city needs to make sure that we search the nation for the best talent. And I'm sure that there will be people in the department that apply, but we want to cast the net wide. We did the same type of search for our police chief--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well okay--",
      "MAYOR BASS:--in the meantime he is more than capable of managing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, wish the city well. We will be watching as you move through fire season. Thank you--",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes. He joins us from Connecticut. Good morning to you. Congressman, you are on the Financial Services Committee, so let's pick up right there. The Supreme Court indicated that the President of the United States does not have the authority to fire the Fed Chair unless there is cause. It sounds like the White House is trying to build a case that they have cause. If they go ahead with it, what happens?",
      "CONGRESSMAN JIM HIMES: Yeah, well, you know, Margaret, the last question you asked the Secretary, shows what a con man he is. And I just listened to his whole thing. And, you know, if you're over the age of five, you've dealt with hucksters and con men. Everything is going to be great in two weeks. By August 1st, we're going to have a deal. The American people are going to be so happy. Complete failure to understand the facts, right? He said that tariffs are paid by foreign countries. Tariffs are not paid by foreign countries. He said, Jay Powell is torturing the American people. Margaret, you didn't have the time, but if you'd had a minute, you would have said, wait a minute. There's a Federal Open Market Committee that is comprised of seven Fed governors, and all of the heads of the central bank offices around the country. That committee, comprised of people who have been appointed by Democratic and Republican Presidents, set the interest rates, right? So, this notion that Jay Powell is unilaterally stopping a decline in interest rates, which, by the way, in the of- in the face- for those of those folks who know a little bit about economics, in the face of up-ticking inflation, which we're seeing, would be absolutely bananas. So, what you just saw was a master class by a huckster and a con man who uses words like torture that are very, very dangerous words, not just for the economy, but for the physical safety of people like Jay Powell.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just to be clear, that's why I said it's not the Chairman's unilateral decision for exactly the reason you raised, that there is a committee that makes the decision. The inflation rate for the CPI was 2.7% if you strip out food- energy and food, which is more volatile, it's up two-tenths of a percent. So, that economic data is what we are pointing to there, not opinion on pricing. But, is there congressional pushback that can be done? I mean, what happens if there's a tweet that says the Fed chair is gone?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, interestingly, inside the White House, and I don't know who it is, my guess is it's maybe the Treasury Secretary is saying, and this is a very difficult thing to say to a person like Donald Trump, that if you fire the Fed chair, either illegally, which they're happy to do, or because you trump up some baloney-like-charge associated with a renovation of the headquarters, there is going to be a massive market reaction, because you cannot lie to the capital markets. We saw this the day after Liberation Day, before we all were familiarized with the TACO trade. The day after liberation day, the stock and the bond markets took a nosedive. So, my guess is that somebody is saying to the president because he doesn't care if he follows the law or not, and the law is very clear that he can't fire the Fed chair. But somebody is saying to the President, the economic instability that gets caused when the cornerstone of the global economy and capital markets all of the sudden has a politically driven interest rate policy. I think that's the one thing that's holding them off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, we're going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on a variety of topics. We need to bring up with you on the other side of it, stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We are continuing our conversation now with Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. Congressman, I want to pick up on that topic. Just a statement of fact here: A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found that the US intelligence community assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election was correct. They deemed it to be so on a bipartisan basis. I'm saying that because today and yesterday, the director of the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, has said that she is referring for prosecution former American officials she accused of treasonous conspiracy, a years-long coup against President Trump, because they assessed Russia had tried to influence the election. This is weeks after the CIA Director issued a report critiquing the tradecraft that went into that 2016 assessment. Is there any legal basis for any kind of prosecution here?",
      "REP. HIMES: None, absolutely none. Margaret, what you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt. Now, you pointed out that the Senate committee, then led by Marco Rubio, a Republican and now Secretary of State, found unanimously that Russia meddled in the election to try to assist Donald Trump. John Durham, special counsel appointed by Donald Trump, investigated this, found that the Senate report was correct. Now, what Tulsi is doing it's a little sleight of hand, but it's worth focusing on. She is saying that the Intelligence Committee, early on, said that the Russians could not use cyber tools to mess with the voting infrastructure, the machines that tally our votes. And that was true then, and it is true now, though the Russians tried to break into a couple of states, you know, election technical infrastructure. They didn't do it, but it is well known and well established that the Russians hacked into the DNC and undertook any number of other influence operations, including buying reams of Facebook ads to discredit Hillary Clinton. That is not in contention, right? And what is horrifying about this whole lie out of Gabbard is, number one, it puts people at risk. And right now, you know, the mouth-breathers on MAGA online are just going out of their minds based on a lie. And number two, the intelligence community is full of very, good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest and it is a really, really bad thing for the safety and security of the American people when that dynamic is- is out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Senate report is online, the findings are there, but I understand your distinction there, and it's an important one in influence versus physical hacking. You're--",
      "REP. HIMES: -- By- by the way Margaret, if I may- if I may, you asked about the referral. Here's the test. This is Epstein all over again. Criminal referrals. We're going to prosecute Barack Obama, you know, treasonous and seditious. Here's the thing, and I hope that 4, 5, 6, weeks from now- don't take it from this Democrat. 4,5,6, weeks from now, let's see if this administration, Tulsi Gabbard, accusing a former president of treason. Let's see if they bring charges. They won't. They won't, because there's not a judge in the land, not a single judge who will treat this with anything other than laughter that will be heard from the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country. So the test of this is 4,5,6 weeks from now, is the DOJ bringing charges? And the answer to that is no. And now we're going to be in Epstein world. We're like, wait a minute, treasonous conspiracy by a former president. Why isn't the Department of Justice bringing charges? And the answer to that question is that it is a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. On the other topic, I want to ask you about as a Democrat, the New York Times-- the DNC--\u00a0 is reporting the DNC examination of what went wrong in the last election is going to steer clear of the decisions made by the Biden turned Harris campaign. You were very direct early on in calling for then President Biden to drop out of this race. You don't parse your words normally. Do you actually think it is possible for your party to self-diagnose problems without looking at the presidential race itself in terms of the candidates?",
      "REP. HIMES: Look, we need to acknowledge and every- and all of America saw it on the night of that disastrous debate in the July before the election that Joe Biden was not going to win the election. That was not just evident in the debate. It was evident in the polling that his people were keeping from him. Okay, so that is a fact. Now, Democrats are a big tent party. We go from Joe Manchin, who's practically a Republican, to AOC who is a Democratic socialist. So, we always have a struggle in coming up with sort of one set of policies, one set of messaging, and it's particularly hard to do when we don't have a presidential candidate. You know, a presidential candidate, of course, attracts the attention, is sort of the one person who must run nationwide and speak for the party as a whole. Right now, we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of different views, and I understand that's enormously frustrating to Democrats who are so upset over the result of the election. But you know, other than fight back with the tools that we have right now, we've got to be introspective about what we have done wrong that resulted in a dramatic win by Donald Trump in 2020*. There's an awful lot of rage in the Democratic Party, and my message to my Democratic friends is fine. I get the rage, believe me. I was in the chamber on January 6, 2021, and worried for my own life. But the thing to do right now is to be introspective and ask yourself, what can we do better to appeal to more people, including those people that we have lost time and time again in elections.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 15 months out from the midterm races. Congressman Jim Himes, thank you. We'll be right back.",
      "*President Donald Trump won the 2024 election. Former President Biden won the 2020 election."

This is a centerpiece to your policy plan. How do you reverse public opposition?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: They're going to love the deals that President Trump and I are doing. I mean, they're just going to love them. You know, the president figured out the right answer, and sent letters to these countries, said this is going to fix the trade deficit. This will go a long way to fixing the trade deficit, and that's gotten these countries to the table and they're going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Next two weeks for the record books, because you have that August 1st deadline. But, President Trump sent letters to most of the major trading partners announcing higher tariff rates effective August 1. That could hit countries accounting for three-quarters of US imports. Let's talk about Canada, one of the big ones. Their Prime Minister said this past week, there's not a lot of evidence they can get a trade deal with the U.S. that avoids tariffs. Is your message to Canada, Mr. Secretary, that no matter what they offer at the negotiating table, free trade is gone, there will be a tariff in place?",
      "LUTNICK: Now, see, that's silly. We have a plan called USMCA. U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Virtually 75% of all goods coming from Mexico and Canada already come in tariff-free. The President said look, unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border, we're just going to keep tariffs on the other 25% and that's what he has on. So, don't be confused about it. The President understands that we need to open the markets. Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the President has. It's fair trade. It's reciprocal trade. Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed? This is an 80-year wrong that President Trump is trying to fix, and our businesses are going to really, really enjoy it. I think the President is going to open between three and $400 billion of opportunity for Americans. That's 1.5%- up to 1.5% GDP growth, because the president's going to open all these markets up. You saw it with Vietnam. You saw it with Indonesia. You're going to watch all these other countries decide if they want to do business with America, let's just open our market up to America. That's the opportunity that President Trump is bringing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw framework announcements with those countries you just mentioned, but back on what the Canadian Prime Minister, the man you're negotiating with, said, he's assuming there's going to be a tariff here. There's already this baseline 10% tariff that we are seeing from the administration. Is that set in stone, or is it going to go to like 15 or 20%?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, I think what you've got is you should assume that the small countries, you know, the Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa, they will have a baseline tariff of 10%. And then the bigger economies will either open themselves up or they'll pay a fair tariff to America for not opening themselves up and treating America unfairly. So, what the President's view is, and what he's instructed me to do is say, look, if you're willing to open yourself up and really open your economy to American business, to ranchers, fishermen, farmers, and businesses, then of course, we'll make a better deal with you. But if you're going to keep your tariffs and your tariff barriers holding us down, then of course, it seems fair that you should pay a tariff to do business with the greatest customer on Earth, the American consumer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so just quickly, are you going to renegotiate that free trade deal, the USMCA?",
      "LUTNICK: Oh, I think the President is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA, but that's a year from today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "LUTNICK: Of course, 75% comes in free but of course, should you expect us to renegotiate it? It makes perfect sense for the President to renegotiate it. He wants to protect American jobs. He doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico when they could be built in Michigan and Ohio. It's just better for American workers. The President's got the American workers back. That's why they elected him. That's why the stock market is at all-time highs. They understand the President actually understands business and is doing it the right way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, okay, let me ask you about Europe. Boeing airplanes, Kentucky bourbon. These are some of the things that the Europeans are looking to target if we get into a trade war as retaliation by them--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --they're not going to do it--",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just met with--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --they're just not going to do that\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the European trade negotiator. He came out kind of downbeat. You disagree, you think we are going to get a deal with the European Union?",
      "LUTNICK: You know, I was on the phone with the European trade negotiators this morning about a half hour ago, so there's plenty of room. Look the president and the European Union, these are the two biggest trading partners in the world talking to each other. We'll get a deal done. I am confident we'll get a deal done. Okay, and it will be great for America, because the President has the back of America. So I think all these key countries will figure out it is better to open the markets to the United States of America than to pay a significant tariff, and Donald Trump has made that point clear. No one has protected America the way Donald Trump has protected America. It is so fun to work for him, because I have him behind me saying the right things for America, and I get to do those negotiations with all these countries, and you are going to see the best set of trade deals you've ever seen for America and for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that August 1st deadline with the EU a hard deadline? Are you going to get a deal since you were just on the phone?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I can't hear anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you- can you hear me, Mr. Secretary? It looks like your shot just froze up on my end. It looks like our remote shot with the secretary is frozen. So we're going to take a commercial break, try to fix it, and try to finish a conversation on the other side of this.",
      "[ COMMERCIAL BREAK ]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Right now, we want to go back to the Commerce Secretary, who I believe can hear me now. Mr. Secretary?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I can hear you now",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, but to pick up where we left off before the technical issues, August 1st, is it a hard deadline with the EU, or is that going to slide?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, no, that's a hard deadline. So, on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in. But, nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on August 1. Now remember, the world is paying 10% right now, and China's paying 30%, so that's right now- and that's why we're running at about plus $30 billion a month for the American people. You got to remember, this is going to pay off our deficit. This is going to make America stronger. We are finally protecting America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you'll have that income if you keep them in place. But, if you're negotiating them away, then they won't be there. So, I that that is contradictory to me. But --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, no, no, no, no. \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you're not negotiating the tariffs away? --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Nothing is getting negotiated away. We have 10% of the world. No, no. 10% is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher, like Vietnam and Indonesia, right? There 19 and 20%. Most countries will pay higher. The small countries are likely to be 10%, but the bigger countries are likely to pay higher. That's just the way it's going to be, because we can't have these $1 trillion trade deficits. It's just wrong for America, and Donald Trump is going to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American corporations are just going to swallow that, and not pass that price increase on to consumers? What's your projection?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: What's so interesting is that you're worried about the importers. How about the people who build and employ Americans here? \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 No I'm asking about people who go to the store to buy \u2013",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: The people who make cars here, people who manufacture here. They don't pay a tariff. They don't pay a tariff at all. So, President Trump says it all the time, build in America, you don't pay a tariff. The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think, it's just a wrong way of thinking about it. Americans deserve to be employed here and have the best jobs in the world, and that's what Donald Trump is trying to deliver.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking about consumer prices, what people will pay when they go to the store --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: They'll be low. I think they'll be low, shockingly low,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. The Consumer Price Index doesn't- doesn't currently reflect that, though. That- the trend is towards higher.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, it just went up, what'd it go up? A tenth of a percent? \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Two-tenths on the core \u2013",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Look, the dollar has declined more than 10%, right? So, the dollar declining sort of softens tariffs completely. These are small numbers. You're going to see, inflation is not going to change. Remember, inflation is an expectation of rates continuing to grow. Tariffs are just going to reset the price level for imports, for certain imports from certain countries. But everybody was building in America. And remember Donald Trump announced over $11 trillion of building in America. All that building in America, the construction jobs here. But then, when those products come on the shelves, they come on much cheaper. Energy is cheaper. I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is. And Jerome Powell has held these rates up way too high, way too high. You're going to see him cut rates. The Fed is going to cut rates. Mortgages are going to be cheaper, and America is going to be so much better off under Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are reports that the Treasury Secretary has talked the president out of his threat to fire the Fed Chair since the Fed is already expected, on a consensus basis, to be lowering rates. Are you telling us tonight or today that he's not under threat, that he will keep his job?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK:\u00a0 The President is an amazingly transparent person. When he thinks something, he says it. So he said, look, this guy is doing the worst job. We have interest rates the same Gabon. You know, Europe- all of Europe, the 27 countries of Europe are in the twos, and we're in the force. That means your mortgage, everybody's watching, the mortgage is two points higher than it should be. So, the Fed should be cutting rates, and Donald Trump's going to try to figure out how to get there. Whether he decides- whether he decides to let Jerome Powell stay in the job or not, I'll leave that to Donald Trump. I think the guy's doing the worst job. He's costing us, you, me, and the American people, more than $500 billion. I think he's costing us $700 billion a year by keeping rates too high. It's just wrong. I don't know why he's torturing America this way. Our rates should be lower.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't unilaterally set those rates, but we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us and sticking through the technical- technical issues we had.",

      "Prologue",
      "Two brothers smoothed a map on the table in front of them. The land they were examining was colored in greens, browns, and grays. Running across the map, like the stripes of a tiger, were irregular white blotches. Each blank space represented the unknown, a section of the map still unplotted and unexplored. The squiggly dotted line of a river, unknown printed in small text, cut through the white. It was 1928 and the world was still a checkerboard of wonder, the continents imperfectly mapped. Ted and Kermit Roosevelt, the two eldest sons of former president Theodore Roosevelt, were planning an adventure. Although they consulted maps from a diverse range of cartographers, including those drawn in China, the unexplored regions persisted. The vast Asian continent dappled with white spoke to them. The world was full of explorers, all examining maps like the ones the Roosevelts possessed. There was a heady, optimistic feeling that persisted among them. No one could be certain which mountain was the tallest on earth nor which trench in the ocean the deepest. Every expedition held the possibility of making its members world-famous explorers.",
      "The 1920s were a decade of discovery, as groups of scientists, adventurers, and hunters ventured forth into the wilderness to fill museum collections. They were successful: every large mammal on earth had been attained, and their bodies mounted in exhibits, except for one.",
      "The Roosevelts desired this one animal so acutely that they could barely speak about it with each other, much less anyone else. \"We did not let even our close friends know,\" wrote Ted of their shared purpose. Some dreams sound too wild when spoken aloud. The animal the Roosevelt brothers coveted looked like no other species in the world. It was a black-and-white bear so rare that many people did not believe it was real. This legendary creature was called the giant panda. Rumors swirled about the mysterious animal. No one, not even naturalists who had worked in China all their lives, could say precisely where the creature lived, what it ate, or how it behaved.",
      "Brown, black, and polar bears had never been in doubt among humans. Even polar bears, although living in the remote reaches of the Arctic, were well known, and had been kept in zoos for thousands of years. In Egypt, King Ptolemy II had a polar bear in his zoo in Alexandria as early as 285 BC. In 1252, a polar bear was part of the Tower of London's extensive menagerie of beasts.",
      "Yet the same could not be said of the panda bear. Even among those living in the Republic of China, spanning some 7.7 percent of the earth's landmass, few had ever caught sight of the creature. Dozens of names were used to describe what might be a panda. In different dialects they called it \"spotted bear,\" \"giant bear cat,\" \"white bear,\" and \"bamboo bear,\" although no one could be sure that all these different names were referring to the same species. There were probable references to the giant panda in Chinese literature as early as the third century, although the descriptions were mythical, describing yellow-and-black creatures that munched on copper and iron. \"While there are tantalizing stories implying that one Chinese emperor or another knew all about panda,\" wrote one author, \"there's one great mystery. Why is there not a single rendition of this endearing beast in any of imperial China's illustrated natural histories?\"",

      "He added, \"Because data are self-reported, they cannot be completely verified by poison centers.\"",
      "Smith also said the study did not analyze nicotine dosage, and that there is the possibility of \"miscategorization of data and missing data.\"",
      "Smith noted the overall decline in nicotine ingestion could be linked to the passage of federal and state legislation.",
      "In 2015, Congress passed the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act, which made it a law for liquid nicotine packaging to be child-resistant. \"This suggests that legislation can make a difference,\" Smith said.",

      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on the MAHA Commission's report on chronic disease rates in children and explains what is contributing to the obesity epidemic on 'Fox Report.'",
      "Obesity among adults continues to be a major public health issue in the United States and other economically developed countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "\"It's a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement,\" Lindsay Allen, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Back in Balance Nutrition in Florida, told Fox News Digital.",
      "While both overeating and lack of exercise are often to blame, a new global study suggests that one factor far outweighs the other.",
      "YOUR DNA COULD BE STOPPING YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Scientists studied more than 4,000 adults from 34 populations, ranging from hunter-gatherer communities to office workers.",
      "They analyzed each person\u2019s total energy expenditure (TEE), which is the number of calories burned daily, along with body fat percentage and BMI (body mass index).",
      "One dietitian says a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement are behind rising obesity numbers. (iStock)",
      "When adjusted for body size, people across all lifestyles and income levels burned similar amounts of energy, even if their daily routines were drastically different.",
      "\"The differences in body fat that we see across populations likely aren't due to major differences in activity level or total daily energy burned,\" study authors Amanda McGrosky (from Elon University in North Carolina) and Amy Luke (Loyola University in Illinois) told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Rather, excess body fat is\u00a0likely\u00a0primarily the product of too many 'calories in,' or eating more calories than are burned.\"",
      "SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT",
      "People in more economically developed areas burned more calories, the researchers noted \u2014 but that\u2019s primarily because they tend to weigh more, and heavier bodies naturally burn more energy.",
      "Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the study concluded that how much people eat plays a far greater role than the amount of exercise when it comes to putting on weight.",
      "The findings suggest that overeating is roughly 10 times more important than a lack of exercise in skyrocketing obesity rates. (iStock)",
      "\"Our analyses suggest that increased energy intake has been roughly 10 times more important than declining activity rates in driving the modern obesity crisis,\" the authors stated.",
      "Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, agrees with the adage that \"you can\u2019t out-train a bad diet.\"",
      "\"Exercise burns far fewer calories than people want to believe,\" Osborn, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Allen pointed out that muscle mass should also be considered.",
      "\"Having sufficient muscle is what drastically improves metabolism and fat-burning capabilities,\" she told Fox News Digital, also emphasizing the importance of stress levels. \"People\u00a0who live in high-stress societies tend to be fatter because stress hormones change our metabolism and shift us into 'survival mode.'\"",
      "SCIENTISTS CAN DETECT JUNK FOOD CONSUMPTION IN BLOOD AND URINE TESTS",
      "Another finding involves ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), which have long ingredient lists that are often calorie-dense, shelf-stable and \"highly palatable.\"",

      "Ultraprocessed foods are less likely to help people feel full, causing them to overeat, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Ultraprocessed foods tend to be easier to overeat due to their flavor and texture, and they also don't keep people feeling full, the study found.",
      "They are also more calorie-dense, meaning they pack more energy into smaller volumes, and are more easily absorbed, making it harder for the body to eliminate excess energy.",
      "\"Ultraprocessed foods are engineered to override our biology, namely our satiety signaling in the brain,\" Osborn told Fox News Digital. \"They also promote inflammation and shift our physiology to a state that favors fat accumulation over fat burning.\"",

      "The researchers pointed out that physical activity is still important, particularly for cardiovascular health, mental well-being and longevity.",
      "Allen noted that people \"need to consider all the other benefits of exercise and shift the mindset away from how many calories they are burning (which actually doesn't work very well for weight loss) toward building as much strength and muscle as they can.\"",
      "People should consider the benefits of exercise beyond just weight loss, a researcher advised. (iStock)",
      "Osborn agreed, recommending \"progressively intense and challenging workouts\" \u2014 strength training in particular \u2014 to help boost the metabolic rate and facilitate fat-burning.",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Sabrina Browne, a Texas-based psychiatrist, explains what flood survivors might experience and how to know when it's time to get professional help.",
      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist and assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner. The mental health professional also mentioned that flood survivors could experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even survivor\u2019s guilt.",

      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "Now no longer a DOJ employee, Weiss spoke candidly for hours with the committee, shedding new light on his interactions with the Biden DOJ and giving fresh insight into why Hunter Biden was never charged with certain violations.",
      "Weiss was appointed U.S. attorney of Delaware during the first Trump administration and began investigating Hunter Biden at that time. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland made Weiss special counsel in August 2023 after a plea agreement with Hunter Biden fell apart.",
      "Republicans had accused Weiss of offering Hunter Biden a \"sweetheart\" plea deal that involved only misdemeanors. But in an unusual move, a judge rejected the deal, leading Weiss to instead bring two successful indictments against the then-first son, one for illegal gun possession and another for nine tax charges, including three felonies.",
      "Weiss came under enormous scrutiny by Republicans and Democrats for his handling of the investigation, which had become a hyper-political national news story centered on the salacious behavior and wrongdoings of Hunter Biden, a recovering drug and alcohol addict, and allegations that Joe Biden was complicit in his son\u2019s crimes.",
      "Republicans claimed Weiss was not tough enough on Hunter Biden, while Democrats said he was being treated more harshly than a typical defendant because he was the president\u2019s son. Joe Biden ultimately granted an unconditional pardon to his son, a move widely criticized by members of both parties.",

      "But, Weiss also indicated that when he first requested lawyers in the spring of 2023, he had to be self-sufficient in finding them and that the deputy attorney general's office was unhelpful. Weiss noted he did not deal directly with former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at all and assumed she was recused from Hunter Biden's cases.",

      "\"I don\u2019t want to say that because I don\u2019t know that they weren\u2019t trying to find people,\" Weiss said. \"All I know was I didn\u2019t get a whole lot of resumes.\"",

      "For his testimony, the Trump DOJ gave Weiss permission in a letter to talk to Congress about Hunter Biden\u2019s cases. The department noted, however, that it could not authorize Weiss to talk about the former first son\u2019s confidential tax information.",

    "story": [
      "It has been one year since former President Joe Biden abruptly withdrew from the 2024 presidential race.",
      "Former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election in a Sunday afternoon social media post a year ago that has since left the Democratic Party in a state of panic as it jumped to a new presidential candidate before suffering a devastating blow by MAGA voters at the ballot boxes in November that year.",
      "A year after Biden's X post sent shock waves felt across the political spectrum, the Democratic Party is still reeling from the botched campaign cycle and has found itself in a \"cold war,\" according to Democrat Julian Epstein, the former House Judiciary chief counsel.",
      "\"The Democratic Party has entered into a new phase of a cold war, whether it realizes it or not,\" \u00a0Epstein told Fox News Digital. \"On the one hand, we have an increasingly radicalized socialist movement, out of step with mainstream voters, dependent on the pander politics of the welfare state, addicted to a sectarian Neo-racialist identititarian ideology, and aligning with the world's most oppressive movements in the Mideast. And most of this is driven by a delusional worldview that progressives are somehow the liberating oppression in West. The problem is almost no voters agree with this worldview.\"",
      "While the other side of the party, he said, is \"a more trad moderate wing\" that is \"glomming on to the new fad known as the 'abundance.'\"",

And those leading this alternative vision seem too easily intimidated by the other wing, and particularly the flying monkeys\u00a0of the online progressive left, whenever they pop their heads up. As a result, the moderates lack any big bold vision to reset the party to a more viable common-sense center.\"",
      "The Democratic Party's current state followed an unprecedented 2024 election cycle that was thrown into a tailspin when Biden officially announced he would not run for re-election in the dead of summer.",
      "Biden's White House staff and campaign had for weeks following his disastrous June 27, 2024, debate against President Donald Trump that the 46th president would remain in the race despite mounting concerns over his mental acuity and calls for him to bow out and pass the torch to a younger generation of Democrats.",
      "Despite allies urging Democratic voters to \"keep the faith\" and support Biden, the president posted a letter to X that read: \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"",
      "Biden shortly thereafter endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take the reins of the Democratic campaign to secure the White House for another term, leaving her with just 100 days to reinvigorate support for the blue ticket.",

      "Harris failed to drum up the support needed to defeat Trump, losing each of the seven swing states, including the key battleground of Pennsylvania that carries 19 electoral votes.",
      "In the wake of the election, Democrats played a blame game for the loss, with some pointing to Harris' campaign, arguing the Biden campaign left them in a lurch with just 107 days. Others pointed to Harris' running mate, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as a weak choice to invigorate voters.",
      "Others pinned blame on the apparent behind-the-scenes push from high-profile Democrats to encourage Biden out of the race.",
      "DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY'",
      "A handful of former President Barack Obama's allies and former advisors publicly helped lead the charge in calling on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race earlier in the summer, including\u00a0David Axelrod, who said Biden was \"not winning this race;\" George Clooney, who called on the president to quit in a bombshell op-ed; and Jon Favreau, who served as former\u00a0director of speech writing for Obama.",
      "\"There is no singular reason why we lost, but a big reason is because the Obama advisors publicly encouraged Democratic infighting to push Joe Biden out, didn\u2019t even want Kamala Harris as the nominee, and then signed up as the saviors of the campaign, only to run outdated Obama-era playbooks for a candidate that wasn\u2019t Obama,\" one former Biden staffer told Politico in the immediate fallout of the election.",

While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\" Sanders posted to X following the election. \"And they\u2019re right.\"",
      "Fetterman, who repeatedly has been identified as the Democratic Party's \"voice of reason\" following the 2024 race, argued in February that the party had become \"toxic\" after years of \"shaming and scolding\" voters.",

I can\u2019t imagine it. And then, by the way, they\u2019re fascists. How can you vote for that?\" Fetterman said on a podcast in February.",

They don\u2019t support insurrection and those things. And if you go to an extreme, and you become a boutique kind of proposition, then you\u2019re going to lose the argument. And we have done that.\"",
      "The party's identity crisis has been underscored by claims it has gone too far to the left in recent years, most notably on social issues such as transgender issues, with even the New York Times editorial board chastising the party in a March op-ed.",
      "\"Democrats should recognize that the party moved too far left on social issues after Barack Obama left office in 2017. The old video clips of Ms. Harris that the Trump campaign gleefully replayed last year \u2013 on decriminalizing the border and government-funded gender-transition surgery for prisoners \u2013 highlighted the problem. Yes, she tried to abandon these stances before the election, but she never spoke forthrightly to voters and acknowledged she had changed her position,\" the editorial board wrote at the time.",
      "Obama has meanwhile told the party to \"toughen up\" and \"stop looking for a quick fix\" after the election.",

      "\"I think it\u2019s going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. And it\u2019s going to require Democrats to just toughen up,\" Obama said at a fundraiser earlier in July, according to excerpts obtained by CNN. \"Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a Democrat, but you\u2019re kind of disappointed right now, so you\u2019re not doing anything.

      "Epstein continued that the Democrat Party's current \"cold war\" is also rooted in an \"addiction\" to \"anger.\"",
      "\"Undergirding all this is a dangerous culture of anger and negativity that has become the party's public face.\u00a0The increasingly loud voices seem to be trapped in a permanent primal scream, and at times seem more like an odd street dance troupe or college protesters,\"\u00a0he said.",
      "\"This is what happens when social media influence rather than governance becomes a party's North Star,\"\u00a0Epstein continued. \"Anger has become the norm on the left, it\u00a0has become an addiction, a shibboleth.\u00a0It's a narcotic within the progressive monoculture, but it's toxic outside of it. Until the party can say \u2018no\u2019 to the activist groups, get more focused on voters rather than online influencers, and move back to the traditional political center as it was in the 1990s, the toxic ratings for the party, the worst perhaps on record, will continue to decline.\"",

      "Kinisi built KR1 to thrive in real-world industrial environments. The robot has two arms and hands, which allow it to lift items weighing up to 22 pounds. Thanks to its strong structure and careful engineering, KR1 can retrieve items from high shelves and handle breakable products without damage. It performs these tasks using a wheeled base that allows for smooth, agile movement across standard warehouse floors. Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where this humanoid warehouse robot can work beyond logistics",
      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Kinisi KR1 shows that the future of work is already here. This robot lifts like a human, moves like a worker and learns like a fast-thinking employee.

      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "Bring in the experts of 3D printing construction",
      "To tackle a project of this scale, UCC Holding brought in the experts. The company partnered with Danish firm COBOD, a global leader in 3D construction printing. As a result, COBOD supplied two massive, custom-built BOD2 printers. Each machine measures approximately 164 feet long, 90 feet wide, and 49 feet high, about the size of a Boeing 737 hangar.",
      "These industrial printers can build structures up to five stories tall. They enable fast, accurate and cost-effective construction that traditional methods can't match.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Before launching the project, UCC's team of architects, engineers and technicians carried out extensive tests. At a trial site in Doha, they completed more than 100 full-scale component prints using a BOD2 printer. To further prepare for Qatar's desert climate, the team engineered a custom concrete mix designed to cure properly in high heat. Additionally, they developed a special extrusion nozzle to ensure smooth, precise printing.",

When compared to the biggest 3D-printed building we know of, these schools are 40 times bigger. They will be built on 328-by-328-foot plots. Therefore, making this project one of unprecedented scale for the region.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Qatar's desert formations were the inspiration behind the architectural design of the schools.

      "UCC Holdings and COBOD construction team's launch Qatar\u2019s 3D Printed Schools Project. (UCC Holding)",
      "How 3D printing enhances sustainability and innovation",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed school project goes beyond architectural innovation; it also marks a major step toward sustainable construction. 3D printing technology reduces material waste by up to 60% compared to traditional building methods. It also minimizes labor requirements and shortens construction timelines, leading to lower overall emissions and energy use.",
      "Moreover, the ability to print complex, curved designs, like the dune-inspired walls of these schools, proves how digital construction methods can unlock new levels of creativity while staying cost-efficient. This approach not only supports Qatar's environmental goals but also sets a new global standard for eco-friendly building design.",

      "Amazon website\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "Keep in mind that this list may not include every product affected by these vulnerabilities. As more research emerges, the list could change. Furthermore, not every device faces all the same risks. For instance, at least one manufacturer seems to have already addressed CVE-2025-20700 and CVE-2025-20701. However, we do not know if this fix was intentional or accidental.",
      "Because of these factors, getting a complete and accurate picture of which devices are truly secure remains a challenge. As a consumer, you should stay alert for updates and check with your device's manufacturer for the latest information.",
      "A pair of Bluetooth headphones\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Firmware updates rolling out but gaps remain",
      "Airoha has addressed the vulnerabilities in its software development kit (SDK) and released an updated version to device manufacturers in early June. These manufacturers are now responsible for building and distributing firmware updates to affected products. If you haven't seen an update yet, it should be arriving soon, though some may already be available.",
      "However, there's a catch. According to a report by German outlet Heise, many of the most recent firmware updates for affected devices were released before Airoha provided its official fix. This means some products may still be running vulnerable code, despite appearing up to date.",
      "To make matters more complicated, consumers typically aren't notified directly about these updates. Firmware patches for headphones and similar devices often install silently, or in some cases, may not be delivered at all. As a result, most users have no way of knowing whether their devices are secure or still exposed to risk.",
      "We reached out to all 10 companies for a comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "5 ways you can stay safe from Bluetooth vulnerabilities",
      "1. Regularly check for firmware updates:\u00a0Visit the manufacturer's app or website to manually check for firmware updates, even if you haven\u2019t received a notification. Automatic updates aren\u2019t always reliable, especially for headphones and earbuds.",
      "2. Turn off Bluetooth when not in use:\u00a0Disabling Bluetooth when you're not actively using it reduces your exposure window and makes it harder for attackers to target your device.",
      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",
      "5. Remove unused paired devices: Go into your Bluetooth settings and delete old or unfamiliar pairings. This helps prevent unauthorized reconnections from previously trusted devices that may now be compromised.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real concern here isn\u2019t the Bluetooth flaw itself, but what happens when the software inside everyday devices fails quietly. Vulnerabilities like this aren\u2019t unusual, but the way they are handled often leaves users in the dark. As long as consumers can\u2019t see or control the software running inside their own headphones, problems like this will keep happening.",

      "\"Unfortunately, a lot of credentials are harvested and sold on the dark web between different threat actor groups despite strong passwords or MFA barriers. Maybe someone lost their password or an administrator had theirs saved on a laptop that was part of another breach. Once those passwords are collected, they get traded or sold,\" Daniel explained.",
      "While brute-force attacks still happen, most criminals don't waste time hammering away at complex passwords. Instead, they exploit simpler routes: snatching passwords from old breaches, targeting users directly or hijacking password vaults, especially those managed by social media admins.",
      "\"Brute-force attacks make a lot of noise and can trigger alerts. It's not the most popular strategy anymore because it's so noisy,\" Tobok adds.",

      "Tobok points out, \"There really isn't public-facing software that notifies you. Sometimes, you might get an email saying, 'We noticed unusual activity. Was this you?' That typically comes through MFA channels. But most executives don't manage their own social media accounts. It's usually someone on their team or a designated admin.

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin.

      "An airliner taking off \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",

      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona.

      "Police forces around the world are adding AI-powered robots.",
      "In a groundbreaking fusion of nature and technology, researchers at the University of Queensland have developed remote-controlled beetles equipped with tiny, removable backpacks that could drastically reduce the time it takes to locate survivors in disaster zones.",
      "Also known as cyborg beetles, these hybrid helpers are part of an ambitious project to improve emergency response in situations like building collapses, earthquakes or industrial explosions.

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Robots at this scale still struggle with climbing vertical surfaces and navigating uneven terrain. These beetles, on the other hand, are naturally built for it. Their footpads and sensory systems let them crawl through narrow cracks and over rubble. This makes them well-suited for the unpredictable conditions found in disaster zones.",

Their natural ability to climb, squeeze and maneuver through tight spaces eliminates the need for complex mechanical systems. The programmable backpack simply adds directional control without harming the beetle or shortening its lifespan. The result is a biological tool that can access places humans and machines cannot.

The goal is to create a lightweight, mobile, and affordable tool that can deliver real-time information from inside collapsed structures and hazardous environments. The team hopes to test the system in a live emergency simulation within the next five years. If successful, cyborg beetles could become a valuable part of urban response efforts around the world.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Researchers are proving that cyborg beetles could play a real role in saving lives. By guiding beetles through tight, dangerous spaces using tiny backpacks and simple controls, scientists are exploring a low-cost and high-impact way to locate survivors where robots and humans can't go.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "Few things frustrate internet users more than losing connection, being watched online or dealing with censorship. If you've ever had spotty service or worried about who might be reading your messages, you're not alone. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter (now X), is developing a new instant messaging app called Bitchat that lets you communicate without needing an internet connection.",

      "Bitchat works by using Bluetooth to send messages to nearby devices. It's designed like old-school chat rooms, where people can message each other directly or go into topic-based chat rooms with private conversations that are intended to be encrypted. Messages can travel up to 984 feet in ideal conditions when messaging directly, or hop device-to-device through other Bitchat-enabled phones to reach their destination in less connected zones.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In a nutshell, Bitchat provides internet- and server-free communication, messages that are intended to disappear by default, no requirement for user IDs (email or phone number), and password-protected chat rooms.",
      "Furthermore, it doesn't collect personal data, and the technology it's built on is intended to work across different devices and platforms, although it's currently only available on iOS via TestFlight. Bitchat is a strong step toward privacy-first messaging, but users are cautioned not to rely on it for sensitive communications at this early stage.",
      "A private chat in Bitchat\u00a0 (@jack/X)",
      "Why this offline messaging app could solve major connectivity problems",
      "Bitchat tackles several pressing challenges of the digital age. For instance, those with limited access to the internet will find it useful during network outages or in areas with poor connectivity. People will also be able to use it in regions with a lot of data restrictions due to government sanctions. Furthermore, it provides true digital autonomy since there's no centralized service storing your communications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What Bitchat is doing is not entirely new. Apps like FireChat and Bridgefy explored similar offline messaging approaches, and while they gained brief popularity during protests and emergencies, they struggled with security flaws and scalability. However, it's Bitchat's renewed urgency at a time when online freedom is increasingly under threat that might propel it above those that came before.",

      "Bitchat is currently in early testing via Apple's TestFlight program. Right now, it's in the experimental phase. However, Dorsey has hinted that he will add more features like Wi-Fi Direct to boost its speed and range. Also, with the technology behind Bitchat being open and decentralized, we could see it embedded into other platforms, meaning more and more people might be using it in the near future.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Bitchat could spark a new era of communication. The app works offline and gives you control over your conversations. You don't have to rely on centralized systems. Bitchat lets you send messages without anyone snooping or profiting from your data. As more people use it, Bitchat could serve as a lifeline during crises. It may help those living under digital restrictions. The app could also challenge companies that ignore privacy. As digital surveillance grows, this app might become more than just a trend.

      "\"What has been going on over the past six months, several different things,\" said Jurinsky. \"She has dismissed cases that absolutely should have been prosecuted.

      "Ghislaine Maxwell, 63, is the only associate held criminally or civilly liable in connection with the allegations against Epstein. In 2016, she sat for a deposition in a civil lawsuit, in which she denied recollection of nearly two dozen flights on Epstein's private jet with an underage Virginia Giuffre, who would go on to become the trafficking duo's most outspoken accuser. Epstein's flight logs showed Giuffre and Maxwell on the plane at the same time 23 times before she turned 18, Fox News Digital reported previously.",

      "\"If she were just given use immunity, she could be compelled to testify,\" Dershowitz said. \"I'm told that she actually would be willing to testify, and there'd be no reason for her to withhold any information. So I don't see any negative in giving her the kind of use immunity that would compel her to testify. So she ought to be summoned in front of a congressional committee.\"",

      "The comments come days after federal authorities said they would ask a federal judge to unseal secret grand jury materials in an attempt to shed more light on Epstein's criminal enterprise. Dershowitz, however, warned that most of the material of interest to the public is not in the grand jury materials, but in sealed court documents, some of which he has already seen.",

      "According to Huckabee, beginning in early 2025, the Interior Ministry\u2019s visa department stopped following the Ministry of Religious Affairs recommendations and began conducting its own investigations into each Christian organization to determine whether they should be recognized as \"Religious Institutions\" and remain eligible for visas.",
      "He cited as examples the Baptist Convention of Israel, Christian Missionary Alliance and Assemblies of God, noting that members of these groups have been denied renewals of their A3 clergy visas and are instead required to complete lengthy questionnaires about their religious beliefs.

      "\"The big difference between GHF and other aid organizations such as the U.N., for example, is that effectively GHF undercutting Hamas or keeping Hamas out of the loop here when it comes to aid,\" Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Despite the criticism and accusations of violence against Palestinians seeking aid at its distribution sites, GHF has delivered over 76 million meals since its operation began in late May. Truzman said that Hamas has taken notice \u2014 and is reacting \u2014 to the GHF\u2019s success, as the terror organization has been unable to control the aid coming from them.",
      "Truzman believes Hamas\u2019 reaction to the GHF is telling and could signal that the group is losing access to a key tool in its arsenal for maintaining control in Gaza. He told Fox News Digital that Hamas uses \"a social welfare program\" to keep its grip on the population.",
      "\"So, for instance, charities that are controlled by Hamas, mosques that are controlled by Hamas, schools that are controlled Hamas and aid that is controlled by Hamas. Now they use it to either feed the community \u2014 Palestinians \u2014 and by doing that they gain this leverage over Palestinians,\" Truzman said. \"Palestinian civilians need this aid to obviously survive and they count on Hamas to do it. So, this is how Hamas could control the population.\"",

      "Hamas\u2019 diversion of aid was something that concerned the U.S. when it began backing GHF as a way to provide Palestinians with what they need without letting terrorists get ahold of it. In June, when the U.S. announced $30 million in funding for the GHF, \u00a0State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott touted the organization\u2019s work distributing aid \"while preventing Hamas looting.\"",
      "\"If GHF wasn't around right now, I think we'd be back to the same old distribution where Hamas would control it, all right, or other Palestinian terrorist groups. I think that's a problem that nobody's really been able to figure out just yet,\" Truzman told Fox News Digital.",
      "The United Nations has been particularly critical of the GHF, something that Truzman attributes more to the U.N.\u2019s \"very anti-Israel stance\" and institutional bias than officials\u2019 desire to stick with methods used in the past.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Facing backlash from MAGA supporters about the handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, President Donald Trump and his administration have released a flood of information on old grievances and issues popular with the base.",
      "Overnight, Trump used his Truth Social social media platform to attack Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., post a fake AI-generated video showing former President Barack Obama being arrested by the FBI and share AI-generated mugshots of a variety of Democratic officials who have served as Republican bogeymen over the years.",
      "Trump also weighed in on another MAGA favorite \u2014 the names of sports teams \u2014 and threatened to try to block a deal to build a new football stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the Commanders changed their name back to the Redskins. The team dropped that name in 2019, after years of criticism that it was racist.",
      "The intensity of the Epstein conversation has dampened since last week, after the Trump administration had to contend with many of its MAGA supporters who were furious that officials weren't releasing more information about the Epstein case. On Friday, Trump sued The Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch after the paper published an article saying Trump sent a letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 that included a drawing of a naked woman.",
      "By Monday, many prominent MAGA social media accounts appeared to have moved on from the Epstein issue, focusing instead on some of the other topics that the Trump administration has been pushing.",
      "\u201cSaying Trump posts random stuff to distract is like saying the sun rises to mess with your sleep schedule,\u201d a former Trump adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what it does.\u201d",
      "On Friday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard revisited the 2016 election, calling for several Obama aides to face prosecution related to Russian interference in that campaign.",
      "\u201cAs is always the case, President Trump was right about the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s clear involvement in the greatest witch hunt in American history and the genesis of the decade-long hoax saga that tore our nation apart and undermined the will of the people,\u201d White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \u201cThe President and his entire administration are committed to unearthing wrongdoing and holding any individual accountable for this gross abuse of power and blatant conspiracy against President Trump and his supporters.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department and other agencies released files Monday that have long been the subject of conspiracies. But they weren't Epstein documents; they were documents on Hillary Clinton and more than 230,000 pages related to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been a particular target of the MAGA base\u2019s ire.",
      "\u201cThe American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government\u2019s investigation into Dr. King\u2019s assassination,\u201d Gabbard, whose agency was also involved in the release, said in a statement. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, we are ensuring that no stone is left unturned in our mission to deliver complete transparency on this pivotal and tragic event in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, criticized the release of the King documents, saying the Trump administration was simply trying to change the subject.",
      "\u201cWe need to be crystal clear on the fact that Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice, it\u2019s a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the MAGA base,\u201d he said in a statement Monday.",
      "Two of King's children, Martin Luther King III and Bernice King, said in a joint statement that while they \"support transparency and historical accountability,\" they \"object to any attacks on our father\u2019s legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods.\"",
      "Bernice King then posted on X, \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",
      "Early this month, the Justice Department released a memo saying that a review had turned up no \u201cclient list\u201d of powerful men who allegedly participated in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking schemes.",
      "That conclusion came despite the fact that in February, Bondi told Fox News that an Epstein client list was \u201csitting on my desk right now\u201d waiting to be reviewed and released.",
      "NBC News recently reported that Trump had become frustrated with Bondi\u2019s handling of the Epstein case and that he wanted her to take responsibility for cleaning up the mess.",
      "The Justice Department also announced Monday it had sent a redacted report to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, about the FBI\u2019s handling of files related to \u201cformer-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s failed investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of highly classified information\u201d during Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state.",
      "\"I commend Chairman Grassley for his unwavering, years-long commitment to exposing the truth and holding those who seek to conceal it accountable,\" Bondi said. \"This Department of Justice is fully committed to transparency and will continue to support good-faith efforts in Congress to ensure accountability across the federal government.\u201d",
      "In a post on X, Grassley wrote, \"Pres Trump/Pam Bondi + Kash Patel and others finally got it done\" and thanked them for their dedication to transparency.",
      "The appendix to the 2018 report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general involves the FBI\u2019s handling of thumb drive devices discovered in the course of the Clinton email investigation.",
      "\u201cIt's all a distraction, and they\u2019ll release anything if it buys them another day or two to not talk about Epstein or to get the angry mob to talk about Epstein,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., quipped: \u201cAre the Epstein files next, if they\u2019re in a releasing mood?\"",
      "Late last week, Bondi, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, also visited Alcatraz Island \u2014 which is now a tourist destination in the San Francisco Bay \u2014 to move forward with the administration's plan to reopen the site as a federal prison. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., criticized it as an effort to \"distract\" from the Epstein controversy and other news unfavorable to the administration.",
      "\"Between the Epstein files, between economic indicators \u2014 prices going up \u2014 so in classic Trump fashion, let's distract. Let's talk about something else. Alcatraz is not a serious proposal,\" Padilla said on CNN last week. \"The cost of bringing that up to minimum standards to serve as a detention facility \u2014 we've been hearing from Republicans all year long, they want to reduce the federal budget. They're looking for cost-savings. This is just another effort to distract from the horrible news brought to you by the Trump administration.\"",
      "Trump also has received some across-the-aisle help in diverting attention from the Epstein saga when Hunter Biden, son of former President Joe Biden and long a target of the MAGA movement's scrutiny, made fresh headlines.",
      "In an interview on YouTube\u2019s \u201cChannel 5 with Andrew Callaghan\u201d that was released Monday, the younger Biden suggested that the sleeping pill Ambien was to blame for his father's poor debate performance against Trump last year. That debate led to Biden's decision to end his re-election campaign one year ago Monday.",
      "\"No one is happier than Donald Trump,\" Sarah Longwell, the anti-Trump commentator and founder of The Bulwark, wrote on X, \"that Hunter Biden has decided we should hear from him at this moment.\""

      "The Kentucky police officer who blindly fired 10 bullets into Breonna Taylor's home in 2020 during a botched raid has been sentenced to nearly three years, her family's lawyer said Monday.",
      "Former Louisville Metro Police Department detective Brett Hankison was sentenced to 33 months Monday after he was convicted of deprivation of rights under color of law in November in connection with the raid that killed Taylor, attorney Lonita Baker said.",
      "Hankison will serve three years of probation after his prison term ends, Baker said.",
      "Last week, the Justice Department said Hankison should be sentenced to a single day in prison because, it argued, he posed no threat to the public.",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse Monday, Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, said U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings \"did the best she could with what she had to work with.\"",
      "\"There was no prosecution in there for us,\" she told reporters.\" There was no prosecution in there for Brianna.\"",
      "Asked whether the sentence represented justice, Palmer said: \"We got something. I don\u2019t think it was a fair sentencing, but it was a start.\"",
      "Probation officials had recommended a sentence of 135 to 168 months, The Associated Press reported.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a sentencing memo filed last week, the Justice Department wrote that \u201creasonable minds might disagree as to whether defendant Hankison\u2019s conduct constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment in the first place\u201d and that there \u201cis no need for a prison sentence to protect the public from defendant.\u201d",
      "A few dozen people outside the courthouse protested in support of Taylor throughout the day, and at one point several were arrested after they created what the police described in a statement as an \"unsafe environment.\"",
      "Bianca Austin, Taylor\u2019s aunt, was among them, arrest documents show. According to a complaint, she was in the middle of an intersection clapping her hands and blocking cars before she approached officers and yelled in their faces.",
      "Austin was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing a highway. It was not immediately clear whether she has a lawyer to speak on her behalf. Jail records show she remained in custody Monday night.",
      "\"We understand this case caused pain and damaged trust between our department and the community,\" the police department said in a statement. \"We particularly respect and value the 1st Amendment. However, what we saw today in front of the courthouse in the street was not safe, acceptable or legal.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors said Hankison fired through a window and a sliding glass door that was covered with a curtain and blinds. The shots hit a wall and traveled into an apartment next door but did not hit Taylor.",
      "Taylor was killed by shots from other officers, who were not charged because they were returning fire when Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired as police breached the apartment.",
      "In a statement last week, Taylor's lawyers called Hankison's sentence recommendation an \"insult\" that sets a \"dangerous precedent\" in how civil rights or Black people are maintained.",
      "\"It is unfathomable that, after finally securing a conviction, the Department of Justice would seek a sentence so drastically below the federal guidelines,\" the statement added.",
      "The legal team said recommending a single day in prison \"sends the unmistakable message that white officers can violate the civil rights of Black Americans with near-total impunity.\"",
      "The attorneys said Palmer still hoped that the judge would \"do what the DOJ has refused to do \u2014 uphold the law, respect the jury's verdict, and deliver true justice for Breonna Taylor.\""

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Tesla enthusiasts began lining up outside Elon Musk\u2019s long-awaited Tesla Diner & Drive-In in Hollywood early Monday, eager to get their first glimpse of what\u2019s inside.",
      "But with little clarity about when the gates would open, some of Musk\u2019s most ardent fans waited hours before they were finally allowed in at 4:20 p.m., a classic reference Musk often makes to marijuana.",
      "Built in the bustling Hollywood location where a Shakey\u2019s Pizza used to be, the retro-futuristic diner, which also doubles as a drive-in movie theater, is filled with Tesla technology \u2014 including its humanoid robot, Optimus \u2014 and merch, such as Cybertruck-themed food containers.",
      "The menu, created by chef Eric Greenspan, featured diner staples, such as fried chicken & waffles, grilled cheese and tuna melts, as well as some themed items, such as the \"Tesla Burger\" with \"Electric Sauce.\" Prices range from $4 for a side of fries to $15 for biscuits & red gravy.",
      "As they entered the facility, guests were greeted by servers on roller skates, who rolled up with ice cream samples. The drive-in projector played the 1960s animated sitcom \"The Jetsons,\" which depicted life in the 21st century and featured flying cars and a housekeeper robot. Guests could order items from a kiosk at the counter.",
      "\u201cI saw videos of [Optimus] online and it was more of a linear movement, but it\u2019s kind of jittery,\u201d said one attendee, who also got the robot to try to make heart shapes with its hand. Optimus was scooping and handing out popcorn on the second-floor roof deck.",
      "The public opening is the culmination of Musk\u2019s yearslong ambition to open a Tesla restaurant in Los Angeles, where the automotive and clean energy company has a large presence. The crowd offered an indication of Musk\u2019s continued popularity among die-hard Tesla fans, even as his tech mogul persona has taken a hit from his foray into politics.",
      "Musk, whose estimated net worth surpassed $400 billion in 2024, was a close ally of President Donald Trump before the two had a public falling-out. His Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s seemingly indiscriminate government spending cuts also caused Tesla stock to plummet as he lost public support.",
      "Still, dozens of people gathered outside throughout the day, waiting patiently to be among the early patrons.",
      "\u201cI like the retro diner. It\u2019s kind of like a Ruby\u2019s Diner. ... Putting all this together is just very unique,\u201d said Vera Hammar, who drove 80 miles from Beaumont with her husband, Morgan, and their daughter, Mackenzie Torres, in hope of seeing what the Tesla Diner has to offer.",
      "The family, who all identify as Tesla superfans, own a total of four Tesla vehicles, including a Cybertruck. (It used to be five before they recently sold one.)",
      "As people stood waiting on the sidewalk for hours, many began to mingle and make friends with other Tesla fans.",
      "Some in line were overheard asking one another what kind of Teslas they have. Others interacted with people whose social media presences they recognized. The creator behind the account for Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, who has 1.2 million followers on X, flew in early Monday and had to keep pushing his return flight back. His friend came in a Cybertruck that was decorated with images of \u201cDoge,\u201d a well-known internet meme that inspired the name of Musk\u2019s DOGE.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been fun waiting, just kind of talking to people,\u201d Vera Hammar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very friendly crowd. Like, [my husband] has seen a lot of people he follows on X.\u201d",
      "A soft launch over the weekend stirred some fanfare online, as invitees showcased the diner\u2019s giant movie theater screens and spacecraft-themed bathroom and Optimus\u2019 serving popcorn at the counter. Videos of the cafe spread across X, YouTube and Reddit."

      "\"Shows that say something, shows that take a stand, shows that are unafraid \u2014 this is not a 'We speak truth to power.' We don't,\" Stewart said. \"We speak opinions to television cameras. But we try. We f------ try, every night.",

      "Paramount and Comedy Central did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Minutes later, Colbert on \"Late Night\" echoed Stewart in responding to Trump\u2019s celebrating his show's cancellation, offering his own \"go f--- yourself\" to the president.",
      "Stewart\u2019s diatribe comes less than a week after it was announced that CBS would be canceling \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d a stalwart of late-night television that Colbert took over in 2015. CBS said it was \u201cpurely a financial decision\u201d and \u201cnot related in any way to the show\u2019s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\u201d",
      "Still, the news shook the entertainment industry and immediately fueled speculation that Colbert\u2019s show, which regularly skewered Trump, had been a casualty of Paramount Global\u2019s efforts to merge with Skydance Media.",
      "That deal has been the subject of particular scrutiny as it awaits approval from Trump\u2019s Federal Communications Commission.",
      "While media mergers and acquisitions have long been the subject of regulatory scrutiny over the outside power of consolidated companies, the Paramount-Skydance deal has taken on a particularly political flavor. Last week, David Ellison, Skydance\u2019s CEO, met with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and made a promise to embrace \u201cdiverse viewpoints\u201d that will reflect \u201cthe varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.\u201d",
      "Since Skydance announced its intention to merge with Paramount in an $8 billion transaction a year ago, the deal has faced multiple delays \u2014 first under the outgoing Biden administration, then under Trump, who accused CBS News\u2019 marquee program, \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d of distorting an interview with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris during the 2024 election and subsequently filed a lawsuit.",
      "While many legal experts viewed the suit as frivolous, media reports said Paramount boss Shari Redstone favored exploring a settlement with Trump as a way to overcome further regulatory hurdles.",
      "The settlement, for $16 million, was announced this month.",
      "The settlement, and the negotiations leading up to it, rankled several high-profile people at CBS. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Scott Pelley said in June that such an agreement would be \u201cvery damaging\u201d to CBS and Paramount. In April, longtime \u201c60 Minutes\u201d editor Bill Owens stepped down, citing the program\u2019s loss of editorial independence. CBS News boss Wendy McMahon quit a month later.",
      "On Monday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Colbert blasted the agreement as a \u201cbig fat bribe.\u201c",
      "Colbert channeled an action-star hero and said CBS \u201cmade one mistake: They left me alive.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd now for the next 10 months, the gloves are off,\u201d he told the audience.",
      "He brought on \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic and Lin-Manuel Miranda to cheer up the crowd with a Coldplay cover, and among those captured on the \u201ckiss cam\u201d were CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen, fellow late-night hosts Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon, and Stewart and John Oliver.",
      "A cartoon Donald Trump was caught embracing a Paramount logo in a sway, a reference to the recent viral incident at a Coldplay concert that led to the resignation of a data company CEO.",
      "Stewart and Colbert have been close for years, dating to when Colbert joined \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d in 1997. In 2005, \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d debuted, airing after \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and launching Colbert into stardom.",
      "Skydance is run by David Ellison, son of Oracle founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. While the younger Ellison made a donation to President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election fund in February 2024, shortly before Biden bowed out of the race, Trump recently signaled his comfort with his takeover of Paramount and its assets, which, in addition to CBS News, also include Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, The CW, MTV, BET and film franchises like \"Smurfs\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog.\"",
      "Stewart said on Monday's \"The Daily Show\"  that Colbert challenged himself by taking on \"The Tonight Show,\" with its vastly larger audience and scrutiny.",
      "\"Watching Stephen exceed all expectations in the role and become the No. 1 late-night show on network television has been an undeniable great pleasure for me \u2014 as a viewer and as his friend,\" Stewart said.",
      "Stewart acknowledged that late-night television is a struggling financial model. \"We're all basically operating a Blockbuster kiosk inside of a Tower Records,\" he said, but he added that when industries change, abandonment is not the answer.",
      "\"When CDs stopped selling, they didn't just go, 'Oh, well, music, it's been a good run,'\" he said.",
      "Stewart, who said last week that he had not heard from Paramount about his show under the merger, made a joke about his own future.",

      "A victim's smartwatch helped search-and-rescue crews locate a plane that went down in dense woods in Montana, the local sheriff's office said Monday.",
      "Responding crews found all three people on board dead, the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.",
      "They were identified as Rodney Conover, 60, and Madison Conover, 23, of Tennessee; and Kurt Enoch Robey, 55, of Utah, according to the office.",
      "The plane they were in departed from West Yellowstone Airport on Thursday just before midnight, the office said. The U.S. Transportation Department Aero Division alerted local authorities that the aircraft's location was unknown, it said.",
      "Search-and-rescue crews gained access to location information on a smartwatch worn by one of the three, leading them to the remote crash site south of West Yellowstone on Friday afternoon, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Two planes used by search-and-rescue crews made the discovery, but team members on the ground still had the work of getting to the crash site in what the sheriff's office described as \"dense timber.\"",
      "Search-and-rescue team members \"located the downed airplane and confirmed all three occupants were deceased,\" it said. \"The decedents were extricated from the plane and transported by helicopter where their remains were turned over to a Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputy coroner.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for information. A report on the FAA's aviation safety database says the aircraft was a variant of the Piper Cherokee, a small, single-engine plane. It was carrying two flight crew members and one passenger, according to the agency.",
      "The FAA was tasked, alongside the National Transportation Safety Board, with investigating the cause of the crash.",
      "The weather for the area in recent days has included afternoon wind gusts as strong as 20 mph or greater, chilly overnight temperatures and daytime high temperatures mostly in the upper 70s.",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer offered his \"deepest condolences\" to loved ones of the deceased."

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Tesla enthusiasts began lining up outside Elon Musk\u2019s long-awaited Tesla Diner & Drive-In in Hollywood early Monday, eager to get their first glimpse of what\u2019s inside.",
      "But with little clarity about when the gates would open, some of Musk\u2019s most ardent fans waited hours before they were finally allowed in at 4:20 p.m., a classic reference Musk often makes to marijuana.",
      "Built in the bustling Hollywood location where a Shakey\u2019s Pizza used to be, the retro-futuristic diner, which also doubles as a drive-in movie theater, is filled with Tesla technology \u2014 including its humanoid robot, Optimus \u2014 and merch, such as Cybertruck-themed food containers.",
      "The menu, created by chef Eric Greenspan, featured diner staples, such as fried chicken & waffles, grilled cheese and tuna melts, as well as some themed items, such as the \"Tesla Burger\" with \"Electric Sauce.\" Prices range from $4 for a side of fries to $15 for biscuits & red gravy.",
      "As they entered the facility, guests were greeted by servers on roller skates, who rolled up with ice cream samples. The drive-in projector played the 1960s animated sitcom \"The Jetsons,\" which depicted life in the 21st century and featured flying cars and a housekeeper robot. Guests could order items from a kiosk at the counter.",
      "\u201cI saw videos of [Optimus] online and it was more of a linear movement, but it\u2019s kind of jittery,\u201d said one attendee, who also got the robot to try to make heart shapes with its hand. Optimus was scooping and handing out popcorn on the second-floor roof deck.",
      "The public opening is the culmination of Musk\u2019s yearslong ambition to open a Tesla restaurant in Los Angeles, where the automotive and clean energy company has a large presence. The crowd offered an indication of Musk\u2019s continued popularity among die-hard Tesla fans, even as his tech mogul persona has taken a hit from his foray into politics.",
      "Musk, whose estimated net worth surpassed $400 billion in 2024, was a close ally of President Donald Trump before the two had a public falling-out. His Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s seemingly indiscriminate government spending cuts also caused Tesla stock to plummet as he lost public support.",
      "Still, dozens of people gathered outside throughout the day, waiting patiently to be among the early patrons.",
      "\u201cI like the retro diner. It\u2019s kind of like a Ruby\u2019s Diner. ... Putting all this together is just very unique,\u201d said Vera Hammar, who drove 80 miles from Beaumont with her husband, Morgan, and their daughter, Mackenzie Torres, in hope of seeing what the Tesla Diner has to offer.",
      "The family, who all identify as Tesla superfans, own a total of four Tesla vehicles, including a Cybertruck. (It used to be five before they recently sold one.)",
      "As people stood waiting on the sidewalk for hours, many began to mingle and make friends with other Tesla fans.",
      "Some in line were overheard asking one another what kind of Teslas they have. Others interacted with people whose social media presences they recognized. The creator behind the account for Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, who has 1.2 million followers on X, flew in early Monday and had to keep pushing his return flight back. His friend came in a Cybertruck that was decorated with images of \u201cDoge,\u201d a well-known internet meme that inspired the name of Musk\u2019s DOGE.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been fun waiting, just kind of talking to people,\u201d Vera Hammar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very friendly crowd. Like, [my husband] has seen a lot of people he follows on X.\u201d",
      "A soft launch over the weekend stirred some fanfare online, as invitees showcased the diner\u2019s giant movie theater screens and spacecraft-themed bathroom and Optimus\u2019 serving popcorn at the counter. Videos of the cafe spread across X, YouTube and Reddit."

      "A Florida man was given 21 life sentences Monday after he pleaded no contest to murder and guilty to other counts in the sexual abuse and death of 13-year-old Madeline Soto.",
      "Stephan Sterns, who had been the boyfriend of Madeline\u2019s mother, entered the pleas in a Kissimmee court as part of a deal that prosecutors said was reached in close coordination with the girl\u2019s family.",
      "Sterns, 39, was sentenced to 21 life sentences, which will run concurrently, or at the same time.",
      "\u201cBecause of the actions of this depraved man, I will never meet the woman she was becoming,\u201d Madeline\u2019s father, Tyler Wallace, who said he wanted to be more of a part of her life, told the court. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t grasp it.\u201d",
      "Madeline\u2019s body was found in a wooded area in Osceola County on March 1, 2024, four days after her mother reported her missing.",

      "He was later indicted by a grand jury on a count of first-degree murder in her death.",
      "Madeline's mother reported her missing after Sterns was to have dropped her off that morning at Hunter\u2019s Creek Middle School in Orlando, where she attended, according to court records. But when the mother went to pick her up after the school day, she learned her daughter had never arrived.",
      "Sterns on Monday pleaded no contest to first-degree premeditated murder, which means he did not admit guilt.",

      "State Attorney Monique Worrell said the plea deal means Sterns waived any right to appeal. She said Madeline\u2019s \u201clife was stolen in a senseless act of violence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe individual responsible has been sentenced to 21 concurrent life sentences and will never walk free again. He has also waived all of his rights to appeal, ensuring finality and sparing the family from reliving this trauma in courtrooms for years to come,\u201d Worrell said in a statement.",
      "Sterns said in court after his pleas that \u201cI have prayed to God countless times to trade places with her, to take me instead, and unfortunately that\u2019s just not how he works.\u201d",
      "\u201cI apologize for all the pain,\u201d he said.",

      "Zambrano said Sterns betrayed Madeline\u2019s \u201clove, her trust, her innocence, her body.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough damage, he took her life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd with her, he killed a piece of our souls.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Food and Drug Administration panel discussing the use of antidepressants during pregnancy Monday largely amounted to misinformation or facts taken out of context, according to several psychiatrists who tuned in to the meeting.",
      "The panel had promised to feature diverse viewpoints about antidepressants and pregnancy. But nearly all of the 10 panelists bucked medical consensus on the drugs\u2019 safety and emphasized what they said were risks of taking the drugs while pregnant \u2014 such as causing autism, miscarriages or birth defects. In some cases, they claimed that antidepressants don\u2019t work at all and that depression goes away on its own.",
      "Three of the 10 panelists were from outside the United States. Another runs a clinic to help people taper off of psychiatric drugs.",
      "\u201cThey were really rousing concerns about safety that are not evidence-based or established and not at all balanced with concerns about the risks of untreated depression,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Goldberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Payne, director of the Reproductive Psychiatry Research Program at the University of Virginia, said, \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the FDA brought people in from outside of the United States when there\u2019s so many experts here in the United States who truly know this [medical] literature inside and out.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA said in a statement that the claim that the panel was one-sided was \u201cinsulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers who dedicate their expertise to these panels.\u201d The spokesperson added that FDA Commissioner Martin Makary \u201chas an interest in ensuring policies reflect the latest gold standard science and protect public health.\u201d",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for a probe into the risks of antidepressants. His \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report in May claimed there were \u201cpotentially major long-term repercussions\u201d associated with use of the drugs in childhood.",
      "The panel discussion focused on a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which includes Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft. The medications increase levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that can improve mood.",
      "Psychiatrists often advise women who are taking SSRIs to continue doing so during pregnancy, since the risks of untreated depression tend to outweigh the potential risks of the medication to mother and child. However, the decision is a personal one.",
      "For ethical reasons, there are no randomized-control trials of SSRIs in pregnant women, meaning data on potential risks mostly comes from observational studies and drug registries.",
      "Some babies born to mothers taking SSRIs may develop symptoms such as jitteriness, irritability or difficulty eating or sleeping that resolve quickly \u2014 what\u2019s known as \u201cneonatal adaptation syndrome.\u201d The symptoms may be caused by medication in the babies\u2019 systems or withdrawal from it.",
      "Certain studies have also found a slightly elevated risk of miscarriage associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy, though others have found no association. However, there\u2019s no convincing evidence to suggest that SSRIs are linked to autism or birth defects.",
      "\u201cWell-controlled studies continue to not find an association,\u201d Payne said.",
      "Women with histories of depression are also at an increased risk of symptoms\u2019 recurring during pregnancy, and depression can come with its own risks \u2014 including thoughts of self-harm or low birth weight.",
      "\u201cThe best thing a pregnant individual could do for herself and her baby is to get the treatment that they need,\u201d said Dr. Nancy Byatt, a perinatal psychiatrist at UMass Chan Medical School, who wasn\u2019t part of the panel.",
      "In addition to raising concerns about side effects, several panelists questioned the efficacy of antidepressants or suggested that data favoring the use of SSRIs was manipulated by the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been said that SSRIs help people who are severely depressed. They don\u2019t,\u201d said David Healy, an FDA panelist and fellow at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom.",
      "Goldberg and other psychiatrists said that\u2019s simply untrue.",
      "\u201cYou can say the moon landing was faked. Conspiracy theories abound in our world. But there is not a doubt about whether SSRIs work,\u201d said Goldberg, a past president of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology who has previously consulted for pharmaceutical companies. He said he was invited to join the FDA panel but declined because the language of the invitation suggested it wouldn\u2019t be a fair discussion.",
      "Healy, the panelist, also claimed that some people \u201crecover spontaneously\u201d from depression.",
      "Another panelist, psychologist Roger McFillin \u2014 who hosts a podcast that challenges conventional mental health advice \u2014 suggested that depression wasn\u2019t an illness but rather a product of \u201cwomen just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely.\u201d He added, without evidence, that many women feel coerced into taking antidepressants.",
      "Psychiatrists who weren\u2019t part of the discussion broadly decried those characterizations.",
      "\u201cI have never, ever, ever, ever heard of a third party pushing a prescription in pregnancy,\u201d Goldberg said. However, he said he is aware of some obstetrician-gynecologists who aren\u2019t as familiar with SSRIs who have wrongly told pregnant patients to stop taking the medications.",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement Monday that SSRIs can be lifesaving for some pregnant people.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s FDA panel on SSRIs and pregnancy was alarmingly unbalanced and did not adequately acknowledge the harms of untreated perinatal mood disorders in pregnancy,\u201d it said. \u201cOn a panel of 10 experts, only one spoke to the importance of SSRIs in pregnancy as a critical tool, among others, in preventing the potentially devastating effects of anxiety and depression when left untreated during pregnancy.\u201d",
      "One panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, a psychiatrist and an OB-GYN at the University of Florida College of Medicine, was the most vocal advocate for using SSRIs, often pushing back against others\u2019 assessments of the risks. Psychiatrists who weren\u2019t on the panel praised her science-backed commentary.",
      "\u201cAll of us can find a study that agrees with exactly what we think,\u201d Roussos-Ross told the panel. \u201cBut we need to look at the data very objectively.\u201d",
      "Several psychiatrists who weren\u2019t on the panel said they worry that the discussion could lead to regulatory action that makes it harder to access SSRIs. For example, one panelist, Dr. Adam Urato, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, called for stronger warnings on SSRI labels.",
      "\u201cI am just very nervous that some of the discourse around the risks of antidepressants could lead to even more barriers for people seeking care,\u201d said Dr. Lindsay Lebin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who wasn\u2019t part of the FDA discussion."

      "The CBO projected the law will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. It found that the law\u2019s net spending cuts of $1.1 trillion are outstripped by the $4.5 trillion in decreased revenue, compared with if the measure had not passed.",
      "The law will also \u201cincrease by 10 million the number of people without health insurance\u201d by 2034, according to the CBO.",
      "Latest poll numbers: A new survey released over the weekend showed Republicans have their work cut out for them in selling the law to the public.",
      "Just 39% of U.S. adults said they approved of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d according to a CBS News/YouGov poll, while 61% disapproved. That\u2019s roughly in line with what other polls found ahead of the legislation\u2019s final passage.",
      "The CBS News/YouGov survey also found that a majority (54%) said they thought the law will increase their health care costs and that a plurality (40%) said it would increase their taxes \u2014 even thought it extends the tax cuts Trump signed into law during his first term.",
      "And while 61% said they thought the package would help wealthy people, far less said it would help the middle class (28%) and poor people (24%).",
      "That all helps to explain why some Republicans are trying to shift their messaging and cast the bill as a tax benefit for \u201cworking families,\u201d highlighting the move away from taxes on tips and overtime in particular.",
      "In the states: As the law is implemented in the coming months and years, its effects will be felt differently state by state. Adam Edelman notes that many of the biggest political fights stemming from the tax cut and spending are already converging in battleground Nevada.",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., post a fake artificial intelligence-generated video showing former President Barack Obama being arrested by the FBI and share AI-generated mug shots of a variety of Democratic officials who have served as Republican bogeymen over the years.",
      "Trump also weighed in on another MAGA favorite \u2014 the names of sports teams \u2014 and threatened to try to block a deal to build a new football stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the Commanders changed their name back to the Redskins. The team dropped that name in 2019, after years of criticism that it was racist.",
      "The intensity of the Epstein conversation has dampened since last week, after the Trump administration had to contend with many of its MAGA supporters who were furious that officials weren\u2019t releasing more information about the files.

      "Josh Kadrmas said he was in the crowd on the opening day of the annual fair Friday waiting for the B-52 flyover when he aimed his cellphone at the sky.",
      "\u201cWe could see the exhaust from the B-52 far to the east, so I started recording as it was announced to the crowd the B-52 was going to fly over the grandstand,\" he told NBC News.",
      "What Kadrmas also wound up catching was faint footage of Delta Flight 3788, which is operated by SkyWest, heading into the same airspace as the bomber.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think this would be a disaster at the time as the smaller plane was difficult to see from the stands,\" he said.",
      "Luckily, the disaster was averted when the pilot of the controls of the Minneapolis-to-Minot plane spotted the bomber in time and was able to perform a go-around maneuver to avoid hitting it and land safely at the North Dakota airport.",
      "Meanwhile, the bomber stayed on course and flew over the cheering crowd gathered at the grandstand, a crowd that included North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who posted shots on X of himself at the fair and of the B-52 in the sky.",
      "Now the Federal Aviation Administration, Air Force and the airline are all investigating the incident, which happened as thousands of people were gathered below on the fairground.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of the recent reporting regarding commercial and Air Force aircraft operating in airspace around Minot International Airport,\" an Air Force spokesperson told the local Minot Daily News. \"We are currently looking into the matter.\"",
      "The FAA stressed the air traffic controllers manning the tower at Minot International Airport work for a commercial contractor.",
      "\"These controllers are not FAA employees,\" the agency said in a statement.",

      "Neither the airline nor investigators have released the name of the pilot. But in video verified by NBC News that was recorded by passenger Monica Green and posted to social media, the pilot explained to passengers what happened in the air.",
      "The controllers in the tower, the pilot said, told him to turn right but that when he looked over he saw the bomber. He said that he was then instructed to turn left, but at that point he \u201csaw the airplane that was kind of coming on a converging course with us\" and flying at a faster clip.",

    "story": [
      "More than 20 nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants to serve victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and those experiencing homelessness, filed a lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration over new funding requirements.",
      "The organizations \u2014 which are spread across more than a dozen states and include Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and Violence Free Minnesota \u2014 allege the changes at the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS) \u201chave thrown a wrench\u201d in their \u201clife-saving work.\u201d Some of the plaintiffs, according to the suit, stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal funds.",
      "The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, states that the new restrictions do not enable the plaintiffs to better serve vulnerable members of society and instead \u201cseek to advance the Administration\u2019s wholly unrelated ideological goals\u2014including to end \u2018diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,\u2019 deny transgender people\u2019s identities, and cut off access to abortion resources and referrals.\u201d",
      "In March, for example, HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced in a post on social media that the department would impose new conditions on funds distributed through its Continuum of Care program, which is designed to end homelessness. The conditions cite several executive orders President Donald Trump issued during the first weeks of his presidency, including that the government will only legally recognize two, unchangeable sexes; deem diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government \u201cillegal\u201d; and end \u201cforced use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.\u201d",
      "HHS and three of its divisions \u2014 the Administration for Children and Families, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services Administration \u2014 were also named as defendants and have enacted similar conditions for grant recipients, affecting the CDC\u2019s Rape Prevention and Education program, funding for families who have experienced domestic violence and grants intended to reduce infant and maternal mortality, among other programs.",
      "In line with those executive orders, the conditions at HUD and HHS prohibit grant recipients from using funds to promote \u201cgender ideology,\u201d which the administration defines as the concept that someone\u2019s gender identity can be different than their birth sex. They also require recipients to certify that they do \u201cnot operate any programs that violate any applicable Federal antidiscrimination laws\u201d and prohibit recipients from using funds to \u201cfund or promote elective abortions.\u201d The complaint argues that the requirements have been written in a way \u201cexpressly designed to expose grantees to civil and criminal liability\u201d under the False Claims Act, which prohibits false claims to the federal government.",
      "The complaint says these new conditions put plaintiffs \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey can accept the conditions\u2014and fundamentally change their programming, abandon outreach methods and programs designed to best serve their communities, and risk exposing themselves to ruinous liability. Or they can decline the funding and halt their funded programs\u2014displacing domestic and sexual violence survivors from safe housing, ending programs designed to reduce and prevent domestic and sexual violence, and putting previously homeless families and children back on the streets,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "HHS, the Administration for Children and Families, the CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration and HUD did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the complaint.",
      "Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs, said the new policy is an example of the administration continuing to \u201ctarget people in vulnerable communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cOrganizations serving survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, LGBTQ+ youth, and people experiencing homelessness should not be forced to abandon their work, erase the identities of those they serve, or compromise their values just to keep their doors open,\u201d Perryman said in a statement. \u201cThis unlawful and harmful policy puts extreme schemes ahead of people\u2019s dignity and safety by restricting essential federal support.\u201d",
      "The suit, which asks the court to permanently block the funding conditions, argues that imposing the restrictions exceeds the government\u2019s authority by circumventing Congress, which generally approves any changes to federal funding.",
      "In addition, the suit argues that in some cases the conditions conflict with other federal policies. For example, recipients of Continuum of Care funds are required to comply with nondiscrimination regulations, the suit states, including HUD\u2019s equal access rule, which requires services, including sleep quarters and bathroom facilities, to be \u201cprovided to an individual in accordance with the individual\u2019s gender identity,\u201d and that individuals are \u201cnot subjected to intrusive questioning\u201d or asked to provide evidence of their gender identity."

      "The director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center announced her resignation Monday, marking yet another high-profile departure as questions loom about the agency\u2019s budget and future.",
      "Makenzie Lystrup, who has served as director of the center in Maryland since April 2023, will leave the agency on Aug. 1, according to a NASA statement. Goddard oversees a number of key NASA missions, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the OSIRIS-REx mission that collected samples from an asteroid.",
      "Lystrup\u2019s resignation comes less than two months after Laurie Leshin stepped down as director of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.",
      "The departures are playing out as NASA and other government agencies contend with significant cuts to funding and personnel, as part of a broader push to shrink the size of the federal workforce. Questions are swirling internally at NASA and on Capitol Hill about how the space agency can accomplish its work with far fewer personnel and why such cuts are moving ahead before Congress has authorized the agency\u2019s budget.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 2,000 senior-level employees are set to leave NASA as part of an effort to cut the agency\u2019s workforce, as was first reported by Politico. Those include people in senior positions of management and individuals with specialized skills, Politico reported, raising concerns about a \u201cbrain drain\u201d at the space agency.",
      "Workers at the space agency have until Friday to accept \u201cdeferred resignations,\u201d buyouts or early retirement offers.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed budget for 2026 would slash about 25%, or more than $6 billion, from NASA\u2019s budget. The steepest cuts would come out of the agency\u2019s space science, Earth science and mission support divisions, according to the budget blueprint.",
      "If enacted by Congress, the budget would also phase out NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, which the agency was developing to return astronauts to the moon.",
      "In response to the budget blueprint, more than 280 current and former NASA employees signed a letter to Sean Duffy, NASA\u2019s interim administrator, stating that the Trump administration\u2019s recent policies \u201chave or threaten to waste public resources, compromise human safety, weaken national security, and undermine the core NASA mission.\u201d",
      "The letter, known as the Voyager Declaration, said the changes have caused \u201ccatastrophic impacts\u201d to the agency\u2019s workforce, and have \u201cprioritized political momentum over human safety, scientific advancement, and efficient use of public resources.\u201d",
      "Before Duffy replaced NASA\u2019s previous acting administrator, Janet Petro, employees pressed her to explain how the budget cuts and restructuring underway served the best interests of the space agency, according to internal correspondence read by NBC News.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Lystrup and Leshin\u2019s departures are related to the ongoing turmoil at NASA and other government agencies. In NASA\u2019s announcement about Leshin\u2019s resignation, it said she was stepping down \u201cfor personal reasons.\u201d",
      "The agency did not provide a reason for Lystrup\u2019s resignation. In an internal email obtained by NBC News, Lystrup said she leaves with \u201cconfidence\u201d in the Goddard\u2019s leadership team \u201cand all of you who will shape the next chapter of this center.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am honored to have been part of this incredible journey with you,\u201d she wrote in the email. \u201cIt has been my privilege.\u201d",
      "NASA said Monday that Cynthia Simmons, Goddard's deputy director, will take over as acting center director in August."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Facing backlash from MAGA supporters about the handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, President Donald Trump and his administration have released a flood of information on old grievances and issues popular with the base.",
      "Overnight, Trump used his Truth Social social media platform to attack Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., post a fake AI-generated video showing former President Barack Obama being arrested by the FBI and share AI-generated mugshots of a variety of Democratic officials who have served as Republican bogeymen over the years.",
      "Trump also weighed in on another MAGA favorite \u2014 the names of sports teams \u2014 and threatened to try to block a deal to build a new football stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the Commanders changed their name back to the Redskins. The team dropped that name in 2019, after years of criticism that it was racist.",
      "The intensity of the Epstein conversation has dampened since last week, after the Trump administration had to contend with many of its MAGA supporters who were furious that officials weren't releasing more information about the Epstein case. On Friday, Trump sued The Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch after the paper published an article saying Trump sent a letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 that included a drawing of a naked woman.",
      "By Monday, many prominent MAGA social media accounts appeared to have moved on from the Epstein issue, focusing instead on some of the other topics that the Trump administration has been pushing.",
      "\u201cSaying Trump posts random stuff to distract is like saying the sun rises to mess with your sleep schedule,\u201d a former Trump adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what it does.\u201d",
      "On Friday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard revisited the 2016 election, calling for several Obama aides to face prosecution related to Russian interference in that campaign.",
      "\u201cAs is always the case, President Trump was right about the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s clear involvement in the greatest witch hunt in American history and the genesis of the decade-long hoax saga that tore our nation apart and undermined the will of the people,\u201d White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \u201cThe President and his entire administration are committed to unearthing wrongdoing and holding any individual accountable for this gross abuse of power and blatant conspiracy against President Trump and his supporters.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department and other agencies released files Monday that have long been the subject of conspiracies. But they weren't Epstein documents; they were documents on Hillary Clinton and more than 230,000 pages related to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been a particular target of the MAGA base\u2019s ire.",
      "\u201cThe American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government\u2019s investigation into Dr. King\u2019s assassination,\u201d Gabbard, whose agency was also involved in the release, said in a statement. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, we are ensuring that no stone is left unturned in our mission to deliver complete transparency on this pivotal and tragic event in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, criticized the release of the King documents, saying the Trump administration was simply trying to change the subject.",
      "\u201cWe need to be crystal clear on the fact that Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice, it\u2019s a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the MAGA base,\u201d he said in a statement Monday.",
      "Two of King's children, Martin Luther King III and Bernice King, said in a joint statement that while they \"support transparency and historical accountability,\" they \"object to any attacks on our father\u2019s legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods.\"",
      "Bernice King then posted on X, \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",
      "Early this month, the Justice Department released a memo saying that a review had turned up no \u201cclient list\u201d of powerful men who allegedly participated in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking schemes.",
      "That conclusion came despite the fact that in February, Bondi told Fox News that an Epstein client list was \u201csitting on my desk right now\u201d waiting to be reviewed and released.",
      "NBC News recently reported that Trump had become frustrated with Bondi\u2019s handling of the Epstein case and that he wanted her to take responsibility for cleaning up the mess.",
      "The Justice Department also announced Monday it had sent a redacted report to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, about the FBI\u2019s handling of files related to \u201cformer-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s failed investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of highly classified information\u201d during Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state.",
      "\"I commend Chairman Grassley for his unwavering, years-long commitment to exposing the truth and holding those who seek to conceal it accountable,\" Bondi said. \"This Department of Justice is fully committed to transparency and will continue to support good-faith efforts in Congress to ensure accountability across the federal government.\u201d",
      "In a post on X, Grassley wrote, \"Pres Trump/Pam Bondi + Kash Patel and others finally got it done\" and thanked them for their dedication to transparency.",
      "The appendix to the 2018 report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general involves the FBI\u2019s handling of thumb drive devices discovered in the course of the Clinton email investigation.",
      "\u201cIt's all a distraction, and they\u2019ll release anything if it buys them another day or two to not talk about Epstein or to get the angry mob to talk about Epstein,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., quipped: \u201cAre the Epstein files next, if they\u2019re in a releasing mood?\"",
      "Late last week, Bondi, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, also visited Alcatraz Island \u2014 which is now a tourist destination in the San Francisco Bay \u2014 to move forward with the administration's plan to reopen the site as a federal prison. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., criticized it as an effort to \"distract\" from the Epstein controversy and other news unfavorable to the administration.",
      "\"Between the Epstein files, between economic indicators \u2014 prices going up \u2014 so in classic Trump fashion, let's distract. Let's talk about something else. Alcatraz is not a serious proposal,\" Padilla said on CNN last week. \"The cost of bringing that up to minimum standards to serve as a detention facility \u2014 we've been hearing from Republicans all year long, they want to reduce the federal budget. They're looking for cost-savings. This is just another effort to distract from the horrible news brought to you by the Trump administration.\"",
      "Trump also has received some across-the-aisle help in diverting attention from the Epstein saga when Hunter Biden, son of former President Joe Biden and long a target of the MAGA movement's scrutiny, made fresh headlines.",
      "In an interview on YouTube\u2019s \u201cChannel 5 with Andrew Callaghan\u201d that was released Monday, the younger Biden suggested that the sleeping pill Ambien was to blame for his father's poor debate performance against Trump last year. That debate led to Biden's decision to end his re-election campaign one year ago Monday.",
      "\"No one is happier than Donald Trump,\" Sarah Longwell, the anti-Trump commentator and founder of The Bulwark, wrote on X, \"that Hunter Biden has decided we should hear from him at this moment.\""

In the summer, I always add apple cider vinegar (not white distilled vinegar), such as this one from Lucy\u2019s, to a small bowl or condiment dish, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and poke small holes on the top with a toothpick. The smell of the apple cider vinegar acts like a magnet for flies. Additionally, Delah Gomasi, managing director and CEO of cleaning services company MaidForYou, highly recommends using both apple cider vinegar and a bit of dish soap for getting rid of fruit flies. \u201cThe main reason a mixture of apple cider vinegar and dish soap works so well in eradicating fruit flies is because the apple cider vinegar attracts the fruit flies whilst the dish soap traps them in the mixture,\u201d he says.",

      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom. This includes leaking drains, dirty mops, compost and pet litter.  This could also include bits of food sitting in your garbage disposal.",
      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "These chemicals can lead to an increased risk of infertility, reproductive health, cardiovascular disease and more, according to Woodruff. Additionally, researchers have found microplastics in several parts of the human body, including blood and the brain, according to Woodruff.",

Unlike plastic, glass food containers aren\u2019t susceptible to leaching microplastics, making them safer to heat up, eat out of and prepare food in. Most of the food containers on this list are made of borosilicate glass, which is highly resistant to heat, thermal shock and cracking (though not shatterproof). Additionally, I also curated options that have ceramic coatings, which makes them stain resistant and nonstick, as well as containers made from stainless steel. While every container on this list is made from either glass or stainless steel, some of the included lids are made of BPA-free plastic and/or come with a silicone lining to prevent leaking, so some of the sets aren\u2019t entirely plastic free.",

      "Many plastic food container sets have chemical additives (many of which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose) with adverse health effects. This includes BPA, phthalates and PFAS \u2014 and those are only the handful of ones researchers know about, according to Woodruff. The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:",
      "Glass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.",
      "If you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.",
      "In addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Leaching is what happens when molecular particles and chemicals in microplastics, like BPA and PFAS, slough off from plastic (in this case, food containers) and get into food, according to Woodruff. While this happens at any temperature, leaching is much more probable when you heat the plastic material, according to Woodruff. This is because heat agitates the molecules in the plastic, making them more susceptible to breaking apart. Additionally, some chemicals, such as BPA, leach more when you prepare acidic foods, such as tomato-based sauces, in them.",
      "Many people and organizations call PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how long they take to degrade and break down in the environment, according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since these chemicals last so long they eventually make their way into food, water and animals, according to the EPA. From there, they can lead to health complications in humans, like infertility and cancer, according to Woodruff.",

      "Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, best known for his role as Theodore \u201cTheo\u201d Huxtable on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d died Sunday at age 54 in an accidental drowning in Costa Rica.",
      "Warner starred on the groundbreaking sitcom for the entirety of its eight-season run 1984 to 1992, becoming a defining television presence for millions of viewers.",
      "The actor went on to build a multifaceted career in television, film, music, poetry and podcasting that spanned four decades.",
      "Following the news of his death, TODAY.com is revisiting Warner\u2019s most recent appearance on TODAY.",
      "See Malcolm-Jamal Warner's final TODAY appearance below.",
      "Last June, Warner stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY to talk about his new newly launched podcast, \"Not All Hood,\" as well as his extensive career in entertainment and the cultural significance of the series that made him famous.",
      "In the interview, Warner displayed the same thoughtful perspective that had guided his career decisions from adolescence.",
      "Sharing a laugh with longtime TODAY anchor Al Roker, Warner joked that he felt like he\u2019d \u201cspent so much of life in this building\u201d at 30 Rock, adding \u201cwe grew up together\u201d in reference to Roker. The weatherman quipped back that he was \u201cmore like his dad.\u201d",
      "The conversation revealed Warner\u2019s continued evolution as an artist and communicator. He spoke passionately about his podcast \u201cNot All Hood,\u201d or \u201cNAH\u201d for short, describing it as his most vulnerable creative endeavor yet.",
      "Warner co-hosted the show with his friends Candace O. Kelley and Weusi Baraka. Its intent, he said in a clip from the podcast, was to \"acknowledge and talk about the different facets\" of the Black community.",
      "\u201cWe have curated a safe space for the three of us to really talk and be honest about the things we feel,\u201d Warner explained on TODAY.",
      "\u201cThere are times where I know there are things that I say that won\u2019t necessarily jive with a lot of people, but this is a place where we want to discuss all lanes of the Black community, and all of those lanes don\u2019t necessarily agree all the time but this is a place where we can have civil discourse and respectful challenging,\u201d he continued.",
      "Warner shared that his perspective on representation was shaped by his early experience on \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy history, the way I came into this business, was a show that had such an impact on culture, everything. White America, Black America, America. And just as that show and that family can not represent all of Black people \u2026 there\u2019s so many of those lanes that coexist and even within those different lanes of the Black community, we can acknowledge each other and even if we don\u2019t agree we can still acknowledge, respectfully, that we are all part of the Black community,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to his cultural work, Warner remained an actor. He starred in nearly the entirety of \"The Resident\" as surgeon AJ Austin and recently made appearances in \"Grown-ish\" and \"9-1-1.\"",
      "Warner traced his career longevity back to early guidance from his mother, who provided crucial perspective when \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d became a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cWhen 'Cosby' first hit I was 14 years old ... and my mom says to me, \u2018Listen, baby, it\u2019s great this show is the phenomenon that it is, but you know how this business is. This show could be over next year. What are you going to do when the show\u2019s over?\u2019\u201d he recalled.",

      "That forward-thinking approach served him well, he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got my head on straight, my soul and dignity is intact. I had a really wonderful journey. And a lot of that had to do with my mom and my dad as well,\u201d Warner reflected.",
      "As the interview wrapped, Warner was asked if he had any words of wisdom to share. He offered these words: \u201cVulnerability can be a scary thing, even when we\u2019re on the mend. Black boys boast bravado not to seem broken, and often so do Black men.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In March 1998, 23-year-old Amy Bradley disappeared from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship as it approached the island of Cura\u00e7ao.",
      "Her parents and younger brother were with her on the trip \u2014 a family vacation before she moved into her first apartment. By sunrise on the fourth day of the cruise, she was gone.",
      "Nearly three decades later, her case remains unsolved. Did she fall off the boat, or \u2014 as her family believes \u2014 did something else happen to her?",
      "\u201cSomebody knows something, somebody saw something, somebody heard something, somebody told somebody something,\u201d her mother, Iva Bradley, says in the docuseries. \u201cNobody can keep a secret their entire life.\u201d",
      "But for Amy Bradley\u2019s family, time hasn\u2019t dulled the urgency. In \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing,\u201d a new Netflix docuseries directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, her parents Ron and Iva Bradley and her brother Brad Bradley revisit those early days and reflect on what it means to live in limbo \u2014 to keep believing, even when answers don\u2019t come.",
      "What has Amy Bradley's family said about her disappearance?",
      "Before the headlines and investigations, there was just a family of four from Virginia. In the docuseries, Amy Bradley\u2019s childhood friend Erin Cullather describes the Bradleys\u2019 home as warm and welcoming, full of joy. Amy Bradley and her brother, close in age, were especially tight. At the time of the cruise, she was 23 and he was 21.",
      "The trip \u2014 a prize their parents won through their work \u2014 felt like a final sendoff for Amy Bradley, a chance to celebrate before beginning her next chapter. She had just signed a lease on her first apartment and was preparing to start a new job. It was meant to be one last family adventure before adult life began.",
      "But everything changed in the early hours of March 24, when Amy Bradley vanished from the ship without a trace.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really terrible feeling,\u201d Iva Bradley says in the docuseries. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re going to go shopping and you\u2019ve got your children with you. The children are playing around underneath all the clothes and you look up and one of the children\u2019s not there. It\u2019s sheer panic. And that feeling is something that doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d",
      "Ron Bradley says he replays that day over and over. \u201cYou wake up thinking about it, go to bed thinking about it. It\u2019s just, everything around reminds you of her.\u201d",
      "For Iva Bradley, the memory is just as present: \u201cEvery day,\u201d she says when asked how often she thinks about her daughter. \u201cNot occasionally, not every other day. Not once a month. Every day.\u201d",
      "The ship\u2019s staff suggested she may have gone overboard, as did officials. At the time of her disappearance, Netherlands Antilles Coast Guard Lt. Sjoerd Soethout said, to reporters, she likely fell from her balcony.",
      "But her family didn\u2019t \u2014 and still doesn\u2019t \u2014 believe that. Over the years, they\u2019ve chased down sightings, tips and eyewitness accounts across the Caribbean. They\u2019ve appeared on \"America\u2019s Most Wanted,\" worked with the FBI and hired private investigators.",
      "\u201cTwenty six years of looking for Amy every day,\u201d Iva Bradley says. \u201cIt\u2019s a life goal.\u201d",
      "Brad Bradley recalled his sister's last words to him in a recent interview with WWBT.",
      "\u201cShe said, I\u2019m going to stay out here on the chaise lounge and a lot of fresh air and wind. I don\u2019t want to go in a closed room right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I told her I loved her.\u201d",
      "Where are Amy Bradley\u2019s parents now?",
      "Today, Iva and Ron Bradley are in their 70s and still live in Virginia. They continue to speak publicly about their daughter\u2019s case and remain actively involved in efforts to keep her story in the spotlight.",
      "In the documentary, they reflect on how the last two decades have shaped their lives \u2014 not as a gradual healing process, but as a state of suspended grief. There\u2019s no closure, only the enduring hope that something \u2014 or someone \u2014 might one day bring her home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of years, you know, of our life searching,\u201d Iva Bradley says. \u201cBut we won\u2019t stop.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve saved all of Amy Bradley\u2019s belongings \u2014 down to the spare change in her wallet and the keys to her car.",
      "\u201cWe keep her car in the garage at home,\u201d Ron Bradley says. \u201cWe keep it out of the weather and keep it shined up so it\u2019s going to be pristine when she gets here. And then she\u2019ll get to drive it again.\u201d",
      "The filmmakers behind \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing\u201d say the Bradleys\u2019 resilience left a deep impression on them.",
      "\u201cHow could you not relate to this family or align yourself with their mission, when we all have parents and kids and loved ones,\u201d director Ari Mark told TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s unfathomable to think that somebody that you care so much about would just vanish without any type of why.\u201d",
      "Where is Brad Bradley now?",
      "Amy\u2019s younger brother Brad Bradley, now in his late 40s, also continues to speak out about her disappearance. In the docuseries, he recounts the final hours he spent with his sister \u2014 dancing at the ship\u2019s nightclub, talking on their cabin\u2019s balcony, planning the next day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell she could have gotten into to be in this type of situation,\u201d he says in the docuseries.",
      "After Amy Bradley disappeared, Brad Bradley paused college and moved back home.",
      "\u201cBefore Amy\u2019s disappearance, life is good, everything\u2019s great, everything\u2019s going well, and then all of a sudden the rug gets pulled out from under us,\u201d he says in the series. \u201cIt felt like this depressing period where one of the most important people in my life was gone.\u201d",
      "Brad Bradley and his father flew back to Cura\u00e7ao shortly after the end of their vacation to search for her themselves, they describe in the documentary series.",
      "They followed a tip from a taxi driver who claimed to have seen Amy Bradley in distress. They visited resorts, walked dangerous roads, and checked abandoned buildings \u2014 anything to follow the trail.",
      "Like his parents, Brad Bradley still believes his sister may be alive. \u201cThe attention she got on that ship wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d he says in the documentary, referring to cruise staff who appeared to take a special interest in his sister. Some of them even asked if she wanted to go out drinking off the boat \u2014 an invitation that now haunts the family.",
      "Years later, the experience continues to shape him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have children,\u201d Brad Bradley says. \u201cI\u2019ll be 48 in December. Subconsciously, I think I\u2019d have to admit, watching my parents lose a child was so traumatic for me that I\u2019m not willing to put myself in a position to go through that.\u201d",
      "Still, he holds out hope.",
      "\u201cWe all have this gut feeling that she\u2019s out there,\u201d Brad Bradley says. \u201cThe lack of closure or the not knowing allows us to continue to hope. So I actually prefer it that way, you know, than the finality of having an answer.\u201d",
      "Still waiting",
      "Amy Bradley\u2019s case remains open with the FBI. Her family has been searching for her for almost 10,000 days \u2014 and they say they have no plans to stop.",
      "\u201cWe will never give up on her,\u201d Iva Bradley says. \u201cIn the morning when we wake up, we say, \u2018Well maybe today,\u2019 and then when we get ready to go to bed at night we have a special little kiss for Amy, and we say, \u2018Maybe tomorrow.\u2019\u201d",
      "They still believe the right person might speak up \u2014 or that Amy Bradley herself might see something, somewhere, and reach out.",
      "\u201cWe put a lot of pictures up online, sentimental things, in case she happens to be able to look at it,\u201d Brad Bradley says. \u201cHopefully she\u2019d see it and know that we\u2019re still trying and still thinking about her.\u201d",
      "For the filmmakers, the Bradleys\u2019 enduring hope shaped every aspect of the project. \u201cWhen you meet this family and you hear how present and alive Amy is for them every single second of every single day, the responsibility for getting a show onto the air is about life and death,\u201d director Phil Lott told TODAY.com.",
      "They don\u2019t pretend to know what happened. But they believe the right eyes on the story could change everything.",
      "\u201cSomething happened to Amy,\u201d Iva says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what that is, but we have to have answers. If you know something, please give us that one thing that we need.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "J Balvin is returning to his roots but with a fresh perspective on life with his latest album, \u201cMixteip.\u201d",
      "Before becoming the household name he is now, the Colombian superstar began his career releasing mixtapes, including 2007\u2019s \u201cReal\u201d and 2008\u2019s \u201cEl Negocio.\u201d",
      "\u201cMixteip,\u201d he tells TODAY.com, takes it back to those early days, describing the 10-track project as \u201ca collection of songs that I love and want to share with my fans.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s showing my versatility, like I can go back to the essence of why people started listening to J Balvin,\u201d he says, sharing how the songs jump from trap, R&B, salsa and a variety of reggaeton sounds. He says it's \u201cshowing that (I) like to do different sounds and different flows.\u201d",
      "At 40 years old, Balvin \u2014\u00a0whose given name is Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvaro Osorio Balv\u00edn \u2014 feels more secure in his work and fearless in elevating Latino culture on a global stage.",
      "His approach to music is all about what brings him joy \u2014 creating without a strict timeline, releasing music videos based on audience reception, and focusing on conquering new spaces.",
      "\u201c(\u2018Mixteip\u2019) is like a warm up of this year, zero expectations,\u201d Balvin says. \u201cI just hope people connect with whichever song they want.\u201d",
      "Read on for TODAY.com's conversation with the artist, including his must-have songs for your summer playlist.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "When you create a song, do you think about how it will play on the dance floor first, or the message?",
      "When I finish the song and we play it, then we just start dancing and see the feeling that I get from it. It's not like I'm planning it. We go have fun in the studio and then we realize that's definitely a song to perrear (get down) or to be in the car with your friends or to dedicate it to someone. We just feel the vibe after we record the songs.",
      "Is there a specific song on 'Mixteip' that you're really proud of or is extra special to you?",
      "\u201cMisterio\u201d with (salsa legend) Gilberto Santa Rosa, who is one of my biggest idols in salsa, really makes me so proud that he said yes (to this song) and that he likes my music.",
      "The first song \u201cBruz Wein\u201d is definitely one of my favorite songs. I chose these songs because I love them all. But of course, you always have those that you feel really proud of.",
      "Do you have plans to release more music videos for other songs on 'Mixteip'?",
      "Yeah, definitely. We are releasing the video for \u201cZun Zun\u201d (July 18). Then we have another video that we have coming up, and, like, two more. Then we\u2019ll see if the people choose one song that becomes the hit of the album. We\u2019ll go and shoot the video.",
      "That\u2019s kind of the way I want to work now. I just want to make sure the fans get what they want.",
      "What are 3 songs from 'Mixteip' that people should add to their summer playlist?",
      "I think \u201cMisterio\u201d because it includes Gilberto Santa Rosa and we mix reggaeton with salsa. The song makes such a big switch because it starts with a romantic reggaeton and then out of the blue it becomes a salsa song. It\u2019s really beautiful.",
      "\u201cZun Zun\u201d with Justin Quiles and Lenny Tavarez is really special because it takes me back to the 2000s reggaeton \u2014 especially my first approach to reggaeton. So that\u2019s also one of my favorites.",
      "And I think the song \u201cBruz Wein,\u201d which is the first song that opens the mixtape. It\u2019s really elegant and classy, sexy, kind of like trap R&B.",
      "Reggaeton and Latin music continue to dominate globally. How do you see your role in the movement now compared to before?",
      "I don't have anything else to prove, you know \u2014 and I'm not saying that in a bragging way. I feel more mature and understand what I have done for the culture, what we have done. It's definitely about how you can get lucky at different levels, right? That\u2019s always been my mission: taking Latinos out of the box, conquering different parts of the world, like India, Asia. And I think my position right now is to keep unlocking new places. I always ask myself, \u201cWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\u201d And that\u2019s what I want to do.",
      "You recently celebrated your 40th birthday. Did your perspective change on your life or career change in any way?",
      "Yeah, I'm constantly evolving and when I turned 40, I just felt more secure and more like, I don't have time for bulls---. I just want to focus on things that really elevate me or make me feel better or good or happier. Also learning how to say no, because that makes me feel free.",
      "So when it comes to your music, are you on a timeline or do you have the luxury of creating when you want to?",
      "Yeah, I think that's the magic. We can do whatever we want to do as long as it's a positive thing that you want to do in the world. I go to the studio anytime I feel that I want to because I really want to have fun. So it's definitely dropping music just because I really enjoy it.",
      "You just performed at the FIFA Club World Cup final halftime show. What is something else you're really looking forward to right now?",
      "I want to conquer India and Asia (with my music). That's something that has me really hyped, and to keep growing, elevating myself in every aspect and have fun in the process.",
      "And lastly, what is on your personal summer mixtape? What songs have you been listening to personally?",
      "I\u2019ve just been listening to Ryan Castro\u2019s album. It\u2019s crazy! I love almost all the songs. His album is called \u201cSend\u00e9,\u201d and that\u2019s basically my playlist right now."

    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian has long been known for her legal advocacy, and she recently convinced Ryan Murphy, the creator of Netflix's \"Monsters: The Erik and Lyle Menendez Story,\" that the Menendez brothers should be released from prison.",
      "Murphy spoke about how Kardashian, who is also starring in his upcoming legal drama \"All's Fair,\" was able to change his mind on the July 20 episode of California Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Murphy told Newsom, who can grant the Menendez brothers clemency as governor, that when he was writing the series, he was on the fence about whether Erik and Lyle Menendez should be freed or not.",
      "\"We had an interesting writers room, where I was the one person in the room who kept saying, 'I'm not so ... I don't think they should get out.' I was the voice of, 'I don't know,'\" Murphy said.",
      "\"In a weird way, what has happened through the show is, I was really, really educated a lot by the other people in the writers room and by the actors,\" he added. \"I was astonished at how I went into something with such a predetermined point of view and came out of it at the end of it thinking, where I am today is, I really do think they should be released. I do think there should be paroled, and I did not think that when I started.\"",
      "Newsom asked how his point of view was able to evolve and asked him to share his journey to coming to his conclusion.",
      "\"What happened to me, was there was a lot of very interesting voices in my path along the way,\" Murphy said. \"For example, one of my good friends who's the star of one of my shows coming up, Kim Kardashian, you may have heard of her, arguably the most famous woman on the face of the earth.\"",
      "Murphy added it's hard to get Kardashian on the phone to talk about \"All's Fair\" because she's studying for the bar exam after completing her law program earlier this year.",
      "Newsom interjected to say Kardashian is constantly reaching out to his office to talk about cases, including advocating for incarcerated fire crews in California.",
      "\"She said, 'Can I see this?' and then I sent (the show) to her early, and she was really obsessed with it, and then went to visit (Erik and Lyle Menendez). Then she called me up and said, 'I really feel like they deserve to be paroled.' And I said, 'Why?'\" Murphy recalled.",
      "\"She talked a lot about really interesting points of view that I had not really thought about, which is, they were under 25, which I think is an interesting point of view,\" he added.",
      "Murphy cited studies that show the prefrontal cortex does not fully develop in men until they are about 26.",
      "\"So there's that argument. Also, they've been model prisoners. Also, I was very moved by their family recently and how the family is so unified,\" Murphy said. \"And I guess it just begs the question, 'If not now, when?' Like, what benefit to society do we have by keeping them there, if they can come out of prison and actually serve some good. I think that's a powerful thing.\"",
      "Newsom said he's had people ask him about the flip side: \"What good can come from sending a message that you can kill both your parents and be released? Why is the society benefited with them being released?\"",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez have been serving life sentences for the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez, their father and mother, in 1989.",
      "A judge resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life in prison on May 13, making them eligible for parole immediately.",
      "The brothers' case received renewed attention from the public after the release of \"Monsters: The Erik and Lyle Menendez Story\" on Netflix last year, including calls for their freedom from Kardashian and many others.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s what your series did, is it really elevated that conversation,\" Newsom said. \"Because there\u2019s a lot of the people in prison that don\u2019t get any attention, that don\u2019t even get in front of the parole board, that don\u2019t have advocates, that don\u2019t have Kim Kardashian making phone calls, they don\u2019t have their day in court, so to speak, at least the court of the parole board and so it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s trying to balance all that.\"",
      "In February, Newsom directed the state's parole board to investigate whether Erik and Lyle Menendez would pose a safety risk to the public if they were to be released from prison. The parole board's decision is set to be released in a set of hearings scheduled for Aug. 21 and 22.",
      "As the governor of California, Newsom can grant clemency to the brothers at any time, and he will be tasked with reviewing the California State Parole Board's recommendation.",
      "\"That's heavy stuff,\" Murphy told Newsom when the governor explained the process on his podcast.",
      "\"Heavy stuff,\" Newsom replied. \"I kept having a temptation to want to see (the show), but with the recognition always in the back of my mind that this thing may land on my desk. I don't want to be persuaded by something that's not in the files.\"",
      "Murphy later called the publicity over the Menendez brothers' case \"a very slippery slope\" and \"a really hard road.\"",
      "\"I feel for you,\" he told the governor.",
      "Murphy then joked that Newsom can watch \"Monsters\" over Labor Day weekend, after he receives the parole board's recommendation in late August.",
      "\"I'm going to see if I made the right decision,\" Newsom said while laughing.",
      "\"I would love for you to watch it, actually, because the thing about that show that I love is it asked the question, 'Are monsters made, or are they born?'\" Murphy said.",
      "Newsom asked what Murphy thinks the show decides about the Menendez brothers.",
      "\"I think ultimately, in the case of these two brothers, I think they were made,\" Murphy said."

    "story": [
      "Billy Joel and Elizabeth Weber\u2019s love story didn\u2019t have a fairy tale start or even a happy ending.",
      "But in between the beginning and the end, the couple got married, forged a powerful partnership that catapulted his career and, according to Weber, created something that was \u201cgreater than the sum of the parts.\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s just a small part of what the \u201cPiano Man\u2019s\u201d ex-wife had to say about him and their union in the first installment of HBO\u2019s two-part documentary, \u201cBilly Joel: And So It Goes.\u201d",
      "Weber and Joel first met in the late 1960s, as he was best friends and bandmates with Jon Small, Weber\u2019s then-husband. In 1969, for the sake of musical convenience and financial benefit, Joel moved in with the couple and their young son, Sean.",
      "Soon Joel and Weber found themselves falling for each other.",
      "\u201cWhen you just find someone you\u2019re comfortable with, who can finish your sentences and knows what you\u2019re thinking without saying anything, sometimes it\u2019s a slow build,\u201d Weber explained in the documentary.",
      "But things changed quickly after they started an affair. Joel confessed his betrayal to Small, and for a time, Weber left both men.",
      "In her absence, a broken-hearted and deeply depressed Joel penned a number of songs about her, and he sent her the recordings.",
      "\u201cHearing those songs was overwhelming,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was stunning that he could accomplish something like that. And so, it had an impact.\u201d",
      "The former lovers got back together, and Weber became the supportive partner Joel had long lacked. Suddenly he had a fire to launch his career in earnest, with her help.",
      "In 1973, pair were married in a courthouse ceremony. And her efforts to help bring his music to the masses led her to take on the role of his manager, too. In fact, she created an entire management group to ensure his success.",
      "Weber took on record company execs, producers and venues to make sure he made it, and it worked. But she wasn't always rewarded for the results.",
      "\"The man is strong and assertive, it\u2019s all good,\" she noted in the documentary. \"But if you\u2019re a woman who makes a decision that people don\u2019t like, the gendered language comes out.\"",
      "And she heard plenty of it.",
      "In the documentary, even Joel admitted, \"it must have been hard being married to me.\"",
      "Ultimately, Weber agreed.",
      "\"Everyone thinks that fame is something special, and there was a lot of nice things about the life we had, but the sense of humor of the gods is fantastic,\" Weber said in the wake of Joel's career trajectory. \"Because you get this, and this is what you pay for it.\"",
      "So as Joel\u2019s musical success soared, it created a strain on both his professional and personal relationship with Weber. To counter that, Weber dropped out as his manager. But Joel\u2019s lifestyle of an indulgent rocker pushed her even further away.",
      "Eventually, even joining the superstar performer on tour became out of the question. Weber couldn\u2019t stand to see what alcohol and drugs was doing to Joel and his band. And as a mother, she couldn\u2019t risk continuing to expose her son to it.",
      "The only time she and Joel spent together after that was when he wasn\u2019t on the road \u2014 and even when he wasn\u2019t touring, he hit the road in another way. He paired his love of booze with a new passion for motorcycling, a move that frightened Weber.",
      "He even wrote a song about her concern after one close call \u2014 \u201cYou May Be Right.\u201d",
      "In it, he sang, \u201cEven rode my motorcycle in the rain / And you told me not to drive / But I made it home alive / So you said that only proves that I\u2019m insane.\u201d",
      "But that 1981 track, from his \u201cGlass Houses\u201d album, wasn\u2019t the end of the subject.",
      "Months after the song\u2019s release, Joel was in a serious motorcycle accident that left him hospitalized with multiple injuries. For him, it was a scary ordeal. For Weber, it was the final straw.",
      "\u201cI would have stayed,\u201d she said, thinking back on that time and their growing emotional distance. \u201cI would have been able, like so many women before, to make that accommodation for someone you love. But there was no way that I could stand by and watch him kill himself. I just didn\u2019t have that in me.\u201d",
      "Today, Weber still cares for the man she divorced in 1982.",
      "\u201cI still have room in my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI love Bill. I always will.\u201d",
      "Joel went on to marry three more times and is now married to Alexis Roderick Joel."

    "story": [
      "Billy Joel is a music icon, a beloved singer-songwriter whose singles, from ballads like \u201cPiano Man\u201d to upbeat hits like \u201cIt\u2019s Still Rock and Roll to Me,\u201d continue to thrill generations of fans.",
      "But he came close to never becoming that legendary musician, never realizing his full potential, never even surviving his 20s.",
      "In the first installment of the two-part HBO documentary \u201cBilly Joel: And So It Goes,\u201d the 76-year-old entertainer and those closest to him open up about a dark time in his life. A time when, after betraying his best friend, he was wracked with guilt and attempted suicide twice.",
      "The friend was Jon Small, Joel\u2019s bandmate in a late \u201860s group called The Hassles, his partner in a 1970 two-man act called Attila and his then-roommate.",
      "Small\u2019s wife, Elizabeth Weber, and their young son were also part of the same household, and over time, Joel and Weber began an affair.",
      "When Small sensed something was off, Joel confessed what was happening.",
      "\u201cSomething was the matter, and Billy, one day, came up to me and became honest to me,\u201d Small recalled in the documentary. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m in love with your wife.\u2019\u201d",
      "Small responded to that with a punch, and what followed was the end of a band, the end of a marriage, the (temporary) end of a friendship and the beginning of deep and devastating depression for Joel.",
      "\u201cI felt very, very guilty about it,\u201d Joel explained in the documentary. \u201cThey had a child. I felt like a home wrecker.\u201d",
      "Weber left both men. And Joel, without a home of his own, began drinking heavily.",
      "\u201cI was depressed, I think to the point of almost being psychotic,\u201d he said of that time. \u201cSo, I figured, \u2018That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u2019 I was just in a lot of pain, and it was sort of like, \u2018Why hang out? Tomorrow is going to be just like today is, and today sucks.\u2019 So, I just thought I\u2019d end it all.\u201d",
      "Joel even involved his sister, a medical assistant, in his plan, though she had no idea what he intended to do when he asked her for sleeping pills. She told him to take one or two at night to help him rest.",
      "\u201cBilly decided that he was going to take all of them,\u201d his sister, Judy Molinari, remembered through tears in the documentary. \u201cHe was in a coma for days and days and days. I went to go see him in the hospital, and he was laying there white as a sheet. I felt that I\u2019d killed him.\u201d",
      "When Joel woke up, he said his first thought was, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even do this right.\u201d His suicidal ideation continued, and as soon as he left the hospital, he tried again.",
      "\u201cBilly was still depressed after that,\u201d Molinari continued. \u201cHe was at my mother\u2019s house, and this time he drank a bottle of Lemon Pledge.\u201d",
      "It was after that second attempt, Joel got help from an unlikely savior. Small, the estranged friend he betrayed, came to his rescue.",
      "\u201cI was the one that had to get him in the hospital,\u201d Small said.",
      "After that, Small reflected on why everything that had happened between them seemed to be the catalyst that drove Joel to such extremes.",
      "\u201cThe only practical answer I can give to why Billy took it so hard was because he loved me that much, and that it killed him to hurt me that much,\u201d he explained.",
      "Small went on to forgive Joel, and eventually, Joel showed himself some compassion, too.",
      "Feeling like a \u201clost soul,\u201d Joel decided to get psychiatric help, turned his life around and channeled those dark days into the music that led to his solo career.",
      "As for Elizabeth Weber, she and Joel later rekindled their romance and wed in 1973. They divorced nine years later.",

But prior to the show\u2019s debut, Hall filed for divorce from Haack, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d",

      "Fulton died July 14, 2025, in Asheville, North Carolina \u201cafter a period of declining health,\u201d per her obituary shared by Groce Funeral Home. She was 91.",
      "The actor was born Margaret Elizabeth McLarty in Asheville to parents James B. McLarty, a minister, and Margaret Glenn McLarty, a public school teacher.",
      "Fulton graduated from Greensboro College in 1956 where she received a degree in music. She went on to perform the drama \u201cThe Lost Colony\u201d in Manteo, North Carolina before she moved to New York City to pursue a career in acting.",
      "In New York, she studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse with legends Sanford Meisner and Lee Strasberg and dance with Martha Graham. She took on the stage name Eileen Fulton and in 1960, was cast in the movie \u201cGirl of the Night\u201d with Anne Francis.",
      "Speaking to The Washington Post in June 1990, she told the publication about her career aspirations when she was younger, explaining, \u201cI dreamed of being the greatest actress on Broadway.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love to sing,\u201d she later added. \u201cI love to make the audience cry. Of course, then I have to cheer them up.\u201d",
      "The same year she was cast in \u201cGirl of the Night,\u201d she received her career-defining role as Lisa Miller on the CBS soap opera \u201cAs the World Turns.\u201d Fulton portrayed Miller, regarded as one of the first  bad girls of daytime television, for nearly 50 years, including through all eight of the character\u2019s marriages, with brief interruptions until the series was canceled in 2010.",
      "Despite Fulton telling NPR in September 2010 that viewers \u201chated\u201d her character, fans eventually came around to Miller. Fulton even said that her character inspired people to name their own children Lisa.",
      "\u201cI was very surprised when I went on the road years ago to find this out,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was the beginning of feminism\u2014women taking up for themselves and going out into the world. Lisa became a businesswoman. She stuck up for herself. She was not somebody to be trampled on.\u201d",
      "Fulton was inducted into the Soap Opera Hall of Fame in 1998 and later received a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004.",
      "Outside of her work on \u201cAs The World Turns,\u201d Fulton also appeared on Broadway in \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf\u201d and in the off-Broadway musical \u201cThe Fantasticks.\u201d For years, she also performed a cabaret act around New York City and Los Angeles, and authored numerous books, including two autobiographies and a series of mystery novels.",
      "Fulton retired in 2019 and relocated to Black Mountain, North Carolina.",
      "The actor was married three times and is survived by her brother, Charles Furman McLarty, niece Katherine Morris and her children Everly and Easton, and sister-in-law Chris Page McLarty."

    "story": [
      "SREBRENICA, Bosnia \u2014 Nedzad Avdic stood on a gravel plateau with four men and boys with their hands tied behind their backs, preparing for death. Just 17, Avdic had been captured by Bosnian Serb forces days earlier. Now, he stood yards from an execution squad.",
      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima.",
      "\"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"I think every civilian casualty in a war is one too many, and every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war in the end.\"",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable. War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Denial and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, head of the fund\u2019s malign finance and corruption team. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."
