      "Refugee children in Kenya's Kakuma camp are turning to dance to cope with harsh conditions",
      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",
      "They make their sharp synchronized moves that they have been perfecting for months.",
      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",
      "The center, which previously featured daily programs such as taekwondo and ballet, may not be operational in a few months if the funding landscape remains as is.",
      "\u201cWe are now reducing some of the activities because we are few. The staff are few and even per day we only have one staff remaining in the center and it is really hard for him/her to conduct 500 children,\u201d said John Papa, a community officer for Terre des hommes in Kalobeyei Village 3.",
      "These programs do more than entertain the children \u2014 they keep them away from issues such as child labor, abuse and crime which as a major concern for humanitarian organizations in Kakuma.",
      "And as the children dance and play beneath the sweltering sun, the only hope is that these child friendly spaces remain operational for years.",

      "The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "Channel 156 has been SiriusXM Fight Nation, which has carried pro wrestling, MMA and boxing shows.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d said Dave LaGreca, the longtime host of \u201cBusted Open,\u201d which started as a one-hour weekly show in 2009. \u201cI really owe it to our fans. They've really been dedicated and asked for this for years. It's a dream come true to actually see it form. And now, it's about to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cBusted Open\u201d expanded to five days a week in 2018 before going to six days one year later. It will have a live episode seven days a week from 9 a.m.-noon EDT on the new channel featuring LaGreca with wrestling stars Bully Ray, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer.",
      "The show has appealed to fans of both WWE and AEW with video clips of interviews getting plenty of engagement on social media.",

      "Five nights a week there will be a \u201cBusted Open After Dark\u201d program, where fans can call in and react after WWE and AEW shows.",
      "\u201cThe great thing is we're not associated with WWE or AEW, so we can give our honest opinion about both products,\u201d said LaGreca, who signed a multi-year extension with SiriusXM. \u201cThe fact that there is a little bit of tension between those two companies and even the fans, it makes it even better for what we\u2019re doing on air. The fact that there are more companies that are succeeding at record-breaking levels is even better for our brand, and the big reason why we\u2019re going 24/7.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",

      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know.

      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \u201cBobby is a stellar example of the statement \u2018to protect and serve.\u2019 We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\u201d",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \u201cTeen Idols Tour\u201d with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman\u2019s Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman\u2019s performances: \u201cDressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with \u2018Easy Come, Easy Go.\u2019 As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\u201d",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children\u2019s Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\u201cEven in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That\u2019s who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\u201d Poublon wrote.",

      "Actor Damson Idris' career is about to hit turbo speed",
      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

      "Mick Ralphs, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died",
      "Mick Ralphs, a guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died.",
      "A statement posted to Bad Company's official website Monday announced Ralphs' death at age 81. Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",

      "Its opening track, \u201cGood Lovin' Gone Bad,\u201d written by Ralphs, was a modest hit, and the song that followed it, \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love,\u201d was a big one that would remain in rotation on classic rock radio for decades.",

      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",

      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",

      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",

TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",

      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" is maintaining its top ranking in movie theaters",
      "NEW YORK -- Neither Pixar nor zombies were enough to topple \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" from the No. 1 slot at North American box offices over the weekend. The Universal Pictures live-action remake remained the top film, bringing in $37 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, despite the sizeable new releases of \u201cElio\u201d and \u201c28 Years Later.\u201d , according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has rapidly amassed $358.2 million worldwide.",
      "Six years after its last entry, the Dean DeBlois-directed \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has proven a potent revival of the DreamWorks Animation franchise. A sequel is already in the works for the $150 million production, which remakes the 2010 animated tale about a Viking boy and his dragon.",
      "Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d had a particularly tough weekend. The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe. \u201cThese would be solid numbers for another original animation film, but this is Pixar, and by Pixar\u2019s remarkable standard, the opening is well below average.\u201d",
      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",

      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "Prosecutors said it was the first time a school district in the U.S. has faced such environmental criminal allegations.",
      "The district is charged with eight counts of violating the federal Toxic Substances Control Act for allegedly failing to perform inspections in a timely manner during a recent five-year period.",

      "Asbestos, a construction material in wide use until the 1980s, has been linked to cancer and lung disease.",
      "Investigators said some asbestos was improperly addressed and that schools have had to close as a result of asbestos problems. Prosecutors said the \u201clongstanding and widespread problem\u201d put students and teachers in danger.",

      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",

      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

      "CDC nominee Susan Monarez says she values vaccines and rigorous scientific evidence but has largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F",
      "Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators Wednesday that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency, elimination of programs and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",
      "She vowed to prioritize innovation, \u201cevidence-based rapid decision-making\u201d and clear communication at the $9.2 billion agency tasked with evaluating vaccines, monitoring diseases and watching for threats to Americans' health.",
      "Monarez declined to say whether she had disagreed with any of Kennedy's decisions regarding the agency to date, saying he has \u201claid out a very clear vision.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",

      "A West Virginia woman has filed a lawsuit seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",

      "NEW YORK -- An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.",
      "The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",

      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief. Many retailers across the state also pointed to the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue the industry brings each year.",

    "story": [
      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's minimum wage is set to rise by about 14% over the next 18 months under an agreement that appears to defuse a potentially divisive issue for the new government.",
      "A commission in which employers and labor unions are represented recommended on Friday that the minimum wage rise from its current 12.82 euros ($15) per hour to 13.90 euros at the beginning of 2026 and 14.60 euros a year later.",
      "The head of the panel, Christiane Sch\u00f6nefeld, said it faced \u201ca particular challenge this year in view of the stagnating economy and the uncertain forecasts.\u201d She said it conducted \u201cvery difficult talks, which were complicated further by the expectations expressed in public.\u201d",
      "Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy, has had a national minimum wage since 2015. It was introduced at the insistence of the center-left Social Democrats, who were then \u2014 as they are now now \u2014 the junior partners in a conservative-led government.",
      "It started off at 8.50 euros per hour, but the independent commission reviews its level regularly. There has been one political intervention, however: under then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, the government in 2022 ordered an increase to 12 euros an hour, fulfilling a campaign pledge by Scholz.",

      "Labor Minister B\u00e4rbel Bas, a leading Social Democrat, said she would implement the commission's proposal. She said she \u201ccan live well with it.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course we wanted more for people in this country,\u201d she told reporters. But she praised the panel for reaching consensus on an increase, \u201cbecause it looked for a long time as though we wouldn't get an agreement at all, and then of course we would have had to talk in the coalition about how to deal with this.\u201d",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV doubled down on Friday on his appeal for unity in the polarized Catholic Church, urging priests to act in communion with their superiors and be models of reconciliation in a world driven by conflicts and divisions.",
      "Leo appealed for unity in a triptych of messages to priests who are celebrating a special Holy Year week in Rome dedicated to clergy. He hosted a special meeting on Thursday afternoon, celebrated an ordination Mass on Friday morning and also delivered a written message to priests around the world.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Leo ordained 32 new priests and recalled his appeal for unity during his installation Mass right after his May 8 election.",
      "\u201cToday, I share this desire once more with all of you,\u201d he said. He quoted St. Augustine \u2013 the inspiration of his Augustinian religious order \u2013 in repeating the words he said on the night of his election: \u201cFor you I am a bishop, with you I am a Christian.\u201d",
      "During the meetings that preceded the conclave that elected the first American pope in history, cardinals made clear their hope that the next pontiff would heal some of the divisions within the church that deepened during the late Pope Francis\u2019 radical 12-year pontificate.",
      "Francis\u2019 progressive social justice priorities, his informal style, liturgical looseness and disdain for the capitalist economic system often alienated conservatives, particularly in Leo's native United States, who begged for a new pope who could pacify divisions.",
      "Leo\u2019s consistent reference to unity in the church suggests he has heard those appeals and is working to respond.",
      "In a message to priests around the world Friday, Leo offered encouragement in his appeal for unity, not a browbeating as Francis often gave priests.",
      "\u201cIn a world marked by growing tensions, even within families and ecclesial communities, priests are called to promote reconciliation and foster communion,\u201d Leo said. He added that priests should not be afraid of their own weaknesses. \u201cThe Lord does not look for perfect priests, but for humble hearts that are open to conversion and prepared to love others as he himself loved us,\u201d he said.",
      "He gave a similar message Thursday to thousands of priests who gathered in a Vatican-area auditorium for a Jubilee rally that ended with Leo giving English-language shoutouts to priests from various parts of the world, including his native Chicago.",
      "In the encounter, Leo acknowledged the \u201ccrisis\u201d in priestly vocations, which have been falling consistently in traditionally Christian parts of the world for years even as the overall global Catholic population grows.",
      "According to Vatican statistics, there were 407,730 priests globally at the end of 2022, down 142 from the previous year. Europe saw the greatest decline, losing 2,745 priests \u2014 a figure that was only compensated for globally by the addition of 1,676 priests in Africa and 1,160 in Asia.",
      "\u201cThank you for who you are, and remind everyone that it\u2019s beautiful to be a priest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t perfect, but we are friends of Christ \u2026 and that\u2019s enough.\u201d",

      "People often know they won't get full recognition as refugees, \u201cbut they set off for Germany because it is known that, even without asylum recognition ... you can have your family follow,\" Dobrindt said. \"That is a significant pull effect and we are removing this pull effect today.\u201d",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are set to sign a peace deal facilitated by the U.S. to help end the decadeslong deadly fighting in eastern Congo.",
      "The deal, to be signed in Washington Friday, would also help the U.S. government and American companies gain access to critical minerals in the conflict-battered, mineral-rich region.",
      "The Central African nation of Congo has been ripped apart by conflict with more than 100 armed groups. The most prominent is the M23 rebel group, backed by neighboring Rwanda, whose major advance early this year left bodies littered on the streets.",
      "With 7 million people displaced in Congo, the U.N. has called it \u201cone of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth.\u201d",
      "Lauded by President Trump last week as \u201ca Great Day for Africa and ... for the World,\u201d the crucial deal comes as part of other ongoing peace talks to end the conflict, including ones mediated by the African Union as well as Qatar.",
      "The agreement involves provisions on respect for territorial integrity, a prohibition of hostilities as well as the disengagement, disarmament and conditional integration of non-state armed groups, U.S. State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told reporters on Thursday.",
      "U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric also said on Thursday that such a deal is welcomed, adding: \u201cWe talk almost every day about \u2026 the horrific suffering of civilians, the hunger, the sexual violence, the constant fear, the constant displacement\u201d in eastern Congo.",
      "Congo hopes the U.S. will provide it with the security support needed to fight the rebels and possibly get them to withdraw from the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, and from the entire region where Rwanda is estimated to have up to 4,000 troops. Rwanda has said it is defending its territorial interests and not supporting the M23.",
      "However, the M23 rebels have suggested the agreement won\u2019t be binding on them. The rebel group has not been directly involved in the planned peace deal although it has been part of other ongoing peace talks.",
      "Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance that includes the M23, told the Associated Press in March that direct peace talks with Congo can only be held if the country acknowledges their grievances and that \u201canything regarding us which are done without us, it\u2019s against us.\u201d",
      "An M23 spokesman, Oscar Balinda, also echoed those thoughts in an interview with AP this week, saying the U.S.-facilitated deal does not concern the rebels.",
      "Analysts say the U.S. government\u2019s commitment might depend on how much access it has to the minerals being discussed under a separate minerals deal being negotiated.",
      "The mostly untapped minerals \u2014 estimated to be worth as much as $24 trillion by the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 are critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol, called the planned deal a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d in the decadeslong conflict, but that the signing could \"in no way eliminate all the issues of the conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe current draft agreement ignores war crimes and justice for victims by imposing a partnership between the victim and the aggressor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seems like a trigger-happy proposition and cannot establish lasting peace without justice and reparation.\u201d",
      "In Congo's North Kivu province, the hardest hit by the fighting, some believe the peace deal will help resolve the violence but warn justice must still be served for an enduring peace to take hold.",
      "\u201cI don't think the Americans should be trusted 100%,\u201d said Hope Muhinuka, an activist from the province. \u201cIt is up to us to capitalize on all we have now as an opportunity.\u201d",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has given way to political pressure and watered down planned welfare reforms to avert defeat by his own party\u2019s lawmakers",
      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer gave way to political pressure on Friday, watering down planned welfare reforms to avoid defeat by his own party\u2019s lawmakers. It\u2019s the latest forced U-turn for a center-left government caught between conflicting goals of cutting spending and improving public services.",
      "The government planned to bring a bill to Parliament next week that would tighten eligibility for a key disability benefit, removing the Personal Independence Payment from hundreds of thousands of people with long-term physical or mental health conditions. Another health-related benefit received by people on low incomes would also be reduced under the plans.",
      "The government said the proposed changes would help people find jobs while preserving a safety net for those who can never work. It would also save an estimated 5 billion pounds ($7 billion) a year from a welfare bill that has ballooned since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But many Labour lawmakers balked at the changes, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimated would cut the income of 3.2 million people by 2030.",
      "More than 120 of the 403 Labour legislators signed a motion that would effectively kill the bill if it were to be passed. Defeat at the hands of his own party in the vote planned for Tuesday would have seriously damaged Starmer\u2019s authority.",
      "To avoid that, the government said no existing recipients would lose either the PIP benefit or an additional payment given to those whose health conditions limit their ability to work.",
      "It seems that much of the opposition has melted away as a result of the overnight concessions, though some on the left of Labour look like they will vote against the bill unless the government rows back further.",
      "Meg Hillier, the chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee and a high-profile rebel, said the changes announced are \u201cpositive\" and show the government is willing to listen.",
      "\u201cI have already had a flurry of messages from people saying they feel this is a good step forward,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "But others including Nadia Whittome remain opposed. Whittome told the BBC that the concessions were \u201cnowhere near good enough.\" She said the bill would now \u201cpunish\u201d people with disabilities for trying to work, as the planned cuts would only affect future claimants.",
      "Starmer was elected a year ago in a landslide victory, winning a commanding majority of seats in the House of Commons. Since then his popularity has plunged as a sluggish economy and stubbornly high inflation resist efforts to raise living standards and ease a cost-of-living squeeze.",
      "Even as Starmer enjoyed success on the world stage \u2014 charming U.S. President Donald Trump and securing a trade deal to exempt Britain from some U.S. tariffs \u2014 Labour lawmakers have grown restive at the party\u2019s sagging poll ratings and the rise of the hard-right Reform U.K. party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "Starmer has been forced into several U-turns. In May, the government dropped a plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees. Last week, Starmer announced a national inquiry into organized child sexual abuse, something he was pressured to do by opposition politicians \u2014 and Elon Musk.",
      "Starmer, who just a few days ago was adamant there would be no changes to the planned welfare reforms, sought to put a brave face on his latest about-turn.",
      "\u201cI have listened to colleagues who have rightly shared ways for us to improve our changes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are taking those improvements forward.\u201d",
      "Starmer insisted that major changes to welfare are needed to deal with a \u201cbroken\u201d system inherited from the previous Conservative government.",
      "The government said spending cuts would be balanced by new money and support to help people who are able to work to find jobs. It also said that it wants to reduce the number of working-age people who are economically inactive through long-term sickness, which it said stands at 2.8 million, the highest rate of any G7 nation.",
      "Though the U-turns may ease some of the political pressures on the government, they come at a cost.",
      "The Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses its work on those on lower incomes, said the changes to welfare and heating subsidies will cost the government 4 billion pounds ($5.5 billion), which will have to be found in the next budget in the fall. This comes at a time when money is scarce given the state of the public finances, international uncertainty and low economic growth.",
      "The latest changes pile pressure on Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who is widely blamed for pushing the cuts in the first place, as she prepares her next budget. Most economists think that it is likely she will have to raise taxes again.",

      "The Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine, in charge of enforcing regulations related to cannabis, held an online meeting Friday with officials across the country to prepare them for the change.",
      "Officials said during the meeting that shops that are currently licensed can continue to operate but they must get their products only from pharmaceutical-grade farms that are certified by the department, and must declare sources of their products to authorities every month. Those farms must also acquire a license for selling cannabis. The order says shops can only sell a limited amount of cannabis to those with a prescription, enough for personal use in 30 days.",

      "The move to decriminalize in 2022 had boosted Thailand\u2019s tourism and farming industries, and spawned thousands of shops.",
      "But the country has faced public backlash over allegations that a lack of regulation made the drug available to children and caused addiction.",

      "She said shops that violate the order will be closed and the ministry will also tighten requirements for approval of a new license in the future. She said there are curently about 18,000 shops that hold a license to sell cannabis.",
      "Chokwan argued that the rules were already in place, but what was lacking was the enforcement. She also said the abrupt change was politically motivated.",
      "\u201cWe know we need regulation. We need control. The existing rule that is in the announcement previously needs to be enforced. Can we enforce that first? Before we move on to something that is harder and people don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.",
      "The ruling Pheu Thai Party previously promised to criminalize the drug again, but faced strong resistance from its former partner in the coalition government, the Bhumjaithai Party, which supported decriminalization.",
      "Bhumjaithai quit the coalition last week over a leaked phone call between Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and former Cambodian leader Hun Sen. Health Minister Somsak signed the new order just days after Bhumjaithai left the government.",
      "The move to restrict cannabis sales came after officials last month revealed that cannabis smuggling cases involving tourists had soared in recent months. Somsak told reporters Tuesday he would like to relist cannabis as a narcotic in the future.",

      "Iranian Kurdish dissidents have been watching from abroad for signs that the government in Tehran might falter after the 12-day Israel-Iran war",
      "IRBIL, Iraq -- From abroad, Iranian Kurdish dissident groups have been watching closely for signs that Iran\u2019s theocracy could falter in its grip on the country, battered by Israeli airstrikes in the intense, 12-day war until a U.S.-negotiated ceasefire halted the fighting.",
      "Israel launched the strikes on June 13, drawing Iranian missiles that targeted Israel. But it was not until the United States inserted itself into the war and hit Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday, including with 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs, that the war came to a watershed moment.",
      "Now, with the fragile ceasefire holding and many Iranians trying to return to a normal life, questions swirl about whether and how much the war has weakened Iran's clerical rule, in place since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "A handful of Iranian Kurdish groups \u2014 many with a distinctly militant past \u2014 have long found a safe haven in northern Iraq\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdish region, but their presence has been a point of friction between the central government in Baghdad and Tehran.",
      "Iraq in 2023 reached an agreement with Iran to disarm the groups and move them from their bases near the border areas with Iran \u2014 where they potentially posed an armed challenge to Tehran \u2014 into camps designated by Baghdad.",
      "Their armed bases were shut down and their movement within Iraq restricted, but the groups have not entirely given up their weapons.",
      "Officials with two prominent Iranian Kurdish groups in Iraq told The Associated Press they are trying to organize politically to ensure that they would not be sidelined should the administration in Iran lose its hold on power.",
      "When asked if their groups were preparing an armed uprising, they either denied it or avoided a direct response.",
      "President Donald Trump floated the idea of \u201cregime change\u201d in Tehran in the wake of the U.S. strikes, only to have his administration later say that was not the goal. Some of the Kurdish dissidents say they expect no immediate upheaval in Iran's ruling theocracy.",
      "\u201cSome of the parties think this war between Iran and Israel is a good opportunity for us\u201d to advance the Kurdish cause, said Khalil Naderi, spokesperson for the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, a separatist Iranian Kurdish group based in Iraq.",
      "But Naderi disagreed with that premise. \"The U.S. and Israel attacked Iran to protect themselves from its weapons, not for Kurdish rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Any premature armed mobilization on their part could endanger both the Kurdish groups and the fragile security of the Kurdish areas, both in Iraq and across the border in Iran, Naderi said.",
      "His stand was a contrast to that of PAK leader Hussein Yazdanpanah, who days after the outbreak of the Israel-Iran war, called on X for Kurdish youth to rise against the authorities in Tehran.",
      "\u201cAttack the enemy, its centers, and its facilities\u201d and \u201cavenge the blood\" of their fallen, Yazdanpanah posted.",
      "And last week in Washington, where he had been pushing U.S. officials to include the Kurds in plans for a potential \u201cday after\u201d in Iran, Abdullah Mohtadi, the head of the leftist Komala Party from Iran's Kurdish regions, said he hopes the Israel-Iran war could represent a turning point.",
      "\u201cWar can bring about internal domestic change,\" he said. \"We hope that this time this will be the case.\u201d",
      "Mohtadi denied that any external player, including the U.S. and Israel, had encouraged Kurdish groups to take up arms. But he didn't rule out the possibility that they would.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t at the moment called for an uprising, or we haven\u2019t called for an armed struggle, but we are monitoring developments very closely,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohtadi maintained that Komala has avoided an armed struggle for nearly 30 years and that its camps in northern Iraq are purely for \u201cself defense.\u201d",
      "Both Komala and the PAK, as well as another exiled Kurdish group, the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan or KDPI, have fought Iranian authorities in the past \u2014 but also sometimes fought against each other.",
      "The groups have different approaches to the question of Kurdish separatism. PAK advocates for an independent Kurdish state, while Komala and KDPI want a system in Iran similar to that in northern Iraq, where Iraqi Kurds have a semiautonomous and self-governed region.",
      "Iran has occasionally launched strikes on the Iranian Kurdish dissidents, but none during the Israel-Iran war this month.",
      "The dissident groups are walking a fine line, balancing the differences among themselves and with their hosts in Iraq, the Iraqi Kurds and the Iraqi government in Baghdad \u2014 neither of which they want to antagonize.",
      "Despite having shared grievances over the marginalization of Kurds in Iran, the Iranian Kurdish parties have not been able to build a consensus",
      "\"We haven\u2019t been able to unite, even though we would like to,\u201d Naderi said.",
      "In March, ahead of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, the Kurdish dissident groups had planned to \u201cmeet and discuss\" Kurdish rights and destiny, but plans fell through. Even now, he said, coordination remains elusive.",
      "Kawsar Fattahi, a central committee member of Komala, said the dissidents should not plan for \u201cthe fall of the regime, but on what will happen after that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Brazil's first lady, Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, is drawing attention for her outspoken role in politics",
      "SAO PAULO -- In early May, an air of triumph filled a dinner in Beijing, where Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva celebrated a diplomatic victory: businessmen travelling with him said they had secured billions of dollars in investments as the veteran leader renewed his international prestige standing alongside his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.",
      "But then Brazilian first lady Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, better known as Janja, raised her hand.",
      "Although no one was expected to speak, da Silva addressed Xi, saying that Chinese social media company TikTok posed a challenge for leftists, claiming its algorithm favors right-wingers. China's president reportedly answered. The exchange was leaked to Brazilian media by the time dessert was served.",
      "Lula\u2019s government is grappling with unpopularity that has dented his credentials as the frontrunner for reelection next year. Some analysts, including members of his government, attribute this partly to his wife\u2019s perceived overstepping in what was once a ceremonial role.",
      "Janja, a 58-year-old sociologist, has drawn criticism for insulting tech billionaire Elon Musk, mocking the suicide of a pro-Jair Bolsonaro supporter and advising the president on how to use the military during the Jan. 8, 2023 riots in the capital, Brasilia. Still, she insists she will speak out whenever it serves the public interest.",
      "A Datafolha poll released June 12 found that 36% of Brazilians think the first lady\u2019s actions hurt the government, while 14% say they are helpful. It was the pollster's first measure of the first lady's approval.",
      "The same poll showed Lula with a 40% job disapproval rating, an 8 percentage point increase from October 2024.",
      "Brazil\u2019s presidency said in a statement to The Associated Press on June 20 that da Silva adheres to the solicitor-general\u2019s office guidelines, adding that she \u201cacts as a citizen, combining her public visibility with the experience she has built throughout her professional career in support of relevant social issues and matters of public interest.\u201d",
      "Under guidelines published by the solicitor-general\u2019s office, the president\u2019s spouse primarily fulfills \u201ca symbolically representative role on behalf of the president in a social, cultural, ceremonial, political or diplomatic nature.\" For many of her critics, this does not grant her the authority to speak as a government representative.",
      "Brazilian media have reported that government ministers, lawmakers and staunch leftist campaigners are privately raising concerns about the first lady being a hindrance more than an asset. These worries have skyrocketed since the incident in China \u2014 even as Lula himself has praised his wife for speaking out.",
      "\u201cIt looks like Brazil is governed by a couple,\u201d said Beatriz Rey, a political science postdoctoral and research fellow at the University of Lisbon. \u201cWhen (the first lady) says there won\u2019t be any protocols to silence her, she disrespects our democratic institutions for she has no elected office, no government position. It is not about being a woman or a feminist. It is undue interference.\u201d",
      "Lula\u2019s first wife, Maria de Lourdes, died in 1971. His second, Marisa Let\u00edcia, died in 2017. Lula, 79, and Janja said they met in 2017 and started seeing each other frequently during the leftist leader's 580 days in jail in the city of Curitiba between 2018 and 2019. They married in 2022.",
      "Many supporters of Lula's Workers' Party partly attribute the criticism against the first lady to misinformation and disinformation. In May, the party launched the \u201cI am with Janja\u201d social media campaign in her defense. But the week-long effort garnered less than 100,000 views and only a few hundred comments.",
      "\u201cJanja is an asset because she rejuvenates Lula, everyone in the government understands that, even her critics,\u201d a Brazilian government source told the AP. \u201cNo one wants to alienate her. But many important people in Brasilia, friends and allies of Lula, do understand that by overstepping she brings some of her rejection to the president.\u201d",
      "The source, who spoke under condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to speak about the matter publicly, often travels with the president and the first lady.",
      "Adriana Negreiros, a journalist who profiled the first lady for a 2024 podcast titled \u201cJanja,\u201d said that allies of the president who criticize her do it with extreme caution.",
      "\u201d(Janja) dances, sings, speaks out, appears at official events and meetings with heads of state. She insists on being present and vocal,\u201d Negreiros said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sexism and misogyny directed at her, no doubt. But not all criticism is sexist.\u201d",
      "Da Silva said she doesn't go to dinners \u201cjust to accompany\" her husband.",
      "\u201cI have common sense. I consider myself an intelligent person. So I know very well what my limits are. I\u2019m fully aware of that,\" she told a podcast of daily Folha de S. Paulo.",
      "Da Silva did, however, express remorse during the same podcast for the expletive she used against Musk in 2024, once a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Many of Lula's adversaries say they want the first lady to remain in the spotlight.",
      "\u201cThe more she speaks, the more she holds a microphone, the more she helps the right wing,\u201d said Nikolas Ferreira, one of Brazil's most popular right-wing lawmakers.",
      "Ferreira, a prominent social media figure, claims the role of regulating social media is a matter for Brazil's Congress, not for the first lady to debate with foreign leaders like Xi.",
      "Da Silva is also expected to play as a keen hostess at the BRICS summit in Rio on July 6-7, a role her husband is almost certain not to oppose.",
      "\u201cShe will be wherever she wants,\" Lula told journalists in March following criticism for sending the first lady as his representative to a nutrition summit in Paris that month.",
      "\u201cShe will say what she wants and go wherever she wants.\"",

      "Police have detained six Americans in South Korea for allegedly trying to send 1,600 plastic bottles filled with rice, U.S. dollars bills and Bibles toward North Korea by sea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Six Americans were detained Friday in South Korea for trying to send 1,600 plastic bottles filled with rice, miniature Bibles, $1 bills and USB sticks toward North Korea by sea, police said.",
      "The Americans were apprehended on front-line Gwanghwa Island before throwing the bottles into the sea so they could float toward North Korean shores on the tides, two Gwanghwa police officers said. They said the Americans are being investigated on allegations they violated the law on the management of safety and disasters.",
      "The officers, who requested anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to media on the issue, refused to provide personal details of the Americans in line with privacy rules.",
      "Gwanghwa police said they haven't found what is on the USB sticks.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in South Korea had no immediate public comment.",
      "For years, activists have sought to float plastic bottles or fly balloons across the border carrying anti-North Korea propaganda leaflets and USB thumb drives carrying South Korean dramas and K-pop songs, a practice that was banned from 2021-2023 over concerns it could inflame tensions with the North.",
      "North Korea has responded to previous balloon campaigns with fiery rhetoric and other shows of anger, and last year the country launched its own balloons across the border, dumping rubbish on various South Korean sites including the presidential compound.",
      "In 2023, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court struck down a controversial law that criminalized the sending of leaflets and other items to North Korea, calling it an excessive restriction on free speech.",
      "But since taking office in early June, the new liberal government of President Lee Jae Myung is pushing to crack down on such civilian campaigns with other safety-related laws to avoid a flare-up tensions with North Korea and promote the safety of frontline South Korean residents.",
      "On June 14, police detained an activist for allegedly flying balloons toward North Korea from Gwanghwa Island.",
      "Lee took office with a promise to restart long-dormant talks with North Korea and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula. Lee's government halted frontline anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts to try to ease military tensions. North Korean broadcasts have not been heard in South Korean front-line towns since then.",
      "But it's unclear if North Korea will respond to Lee's conciliatory gesture after vowing last year to sever relations with South Korea and abandon the goal of peaceful Korean reunification. Official talks between the Koreas have been stalled since 2019, when U.S.-led diplomacy on North Korean denuclearization derailed.",

      "Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court has stopped an investigation into President Gustavo Petro's 2022 campaign financing",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court on Thursday stopped an electoral body from investigating accusations of illicit campaign financing and unreported spending by President Gustavo Petro, delivering a legal victory to the beleaguered left-wing leader.",
      "The court ruled that only Congress can investigate alleged irregularities in the financing of Petro's 2022 campaign. Petro has denied any financial impropriety.",
      "The ruling scraps a probe by the National Electoral Council into whether Petro's campaign exceeded fundraising limits by about $1.2 million and whether it accepted funds from labor organizations, which is banned by Colombian law.",
      "The council is an administrative body that supervises the electoral process and oversees campaign financing. It can also impose administrative sanctions, such as hefty fines against campaign staffers.",
      "The court ordered the electoral council to refer its investigation to Colombia\u2019s House of Representatives.",
      "It's unclear whether lawmakers will advance the case. Although Petro often clashes with Congress, lawmakers have never removed a Colombian president from office, even in the face of intense public pressure when investigators in 1996 demonstrated then-President Ernesto Samper's ties to drug cartel financing.",
      "Petro fiercely criticized the electoral council as politically motivated, opening another front in his battles against the country\u2019s courts, which have overturned some of his key decrees and appointments.",
      "The officials on the electoral council planned to examine campaign contributions by unions of public school teachers and oil workers, among others, citing a dozen financial transactions Petro's campaign had allegedly failed to report.",
      "On Thursday, Petro applauded the court's decision.",
      "\u201cWell done to the Constitutional Court,\u201d he posted on social media platform X.",
      "This was just the latest in a swirl of scandals over the financing of Petro's campaign.",
      "The Attorney General\u2019s office has also been investigating Petro\u2019s son Nicol\u00e1s over allegations that the campaign took funds from criminal sources, including a notorious former drug trafficker.",

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- Ever since Ecuador's most notorious gang leader vanished from his prison cell in January 2024, authorities have been searching the world, offering a $1 million reward for information leading to the capture of Adolfo Mac\u00edas, alias \u201cFito.\"",
      "It turned out the country\u2019s most wanted man was hiding out at a family member\u2019s mansion in his own hometown.",
      "Ecuadorian security forces recaptured the kingpin Wednesday at an underground bunker beneath a marble-walled house in the port city of Manta, some 260 kilometers (161 miles) southwest of the capital of Quito.",
      "In a remarks to reporters Thursday, authorities revealed further details about their efforts to locate Mac\u00edas and the hiding place where he spent his final weeks as a fugitive.",
      "Authorities had issued an international arrest warrant for Mac\u00edas, who was serving a 34-year prison sentence for drug trafficking, organized crime and murder in a Guayaquil prison before his shock escape. Mac\u00edas is also wanted by the United States on accusations of trafficking drugs and smuggling weapons.",
      "A month ago, authorities closed in on the drug trafficker's family, arresting several of his relatives, seizing their assets and raiding their businesses. Interior Minister John Reimberg described the crackdown on Mac\u00edas\u2019 family as a \u201cpsychological operation\u201d crucial to security forces' efforts to locate the notorious leader of Ecuador's \u201cLos Choneros\" gang.",
      "\u201cIt contributes to a person's conflict, their loss of control,\u201d he said in a press conference Thursday.",
      "But what put Ecuadorian intelligence on his trail was the unusual behavior of a municipal transit official in Manta, who stopped showing up to work several months ago. Surveilling the official led intelligence services to Mac\u00edas' inner circle, according to V\u00edctor Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, a national police commander.",
      "Authorities discovered that this official frequented a swanky three-story building equipped with an indoor pool, well-appointed gym and game room and outfitted with gleaming marble floors and walls.",
      "Furniture was wrapped in plastic and flat screen TVs were still in their boxes. All over the house were statues of Saint Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of hopeless causes venerated by Mexican drug traffickers. Los Choneros is believed to have been one of the first from Ecuador to forge ties with Mexican drug cartels.",
      "Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez also said that authorities received final confirmation that Mac\u00edas would be in the house at the time of the 10-hourlong raid from his young daughter.",
      "In the predawn darkness Wednesday, hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and security officers stormed the mansion and blocked off the surrounding streets. But Mac\u00edas was nowhere to be found.",
      "Security forces flew drones overhead and noticed that the land around the house appeared uneven, with suspiciously altered vegetation that suggested infrastructure and possible ventilation below the surface.",
      "The fugitive was hunkered down in an air-conditioned bunker that could only be accessed through a small hatch, its entrance concealed by a cement and tile floor in the laundry room and openable only from the inside.",
      "Police brought in heavy machinery to start excavating, and when the roof above his head began to cave in Mac\u00edas recognized that capture was inevitable, Minister Reimberg said. The alternative was being crushed to death.",
      "\u201cWhen this happened, Fito panicked,\u201d he said. \u201cHe opened the hatch where military and police personnel were located and left the hole.\u201d",
      "Within moments, Ecuador's most powerful drug lord was writhing on the ground with a gun pointed at his head, forced to repeat his full name out loud.",
      "Shirtless and with an unkempt beard, a haggard \u201cFito\u201d was shepherded outside by a squad of officers and brought to the country\u2019s highest-security prison, known as La Roca, or the Rock, in Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s largest city.",
      "Ecuador\u2019s President Daniel Noboa announced after the capture that the Mac\u00edas would be extradited to the U.S. to face prosecution. He was indicted in New York City in April on charges of importing and distributing thousands of pounds of cocaine in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have done our part,\u201d Reimberg said. \u201cI expect the U.S. extradition request to arrive in the next few hours or at most the next few days.\"",

      "An Argentine judge has ordered that the 10 Lebanese and Iranian citizens accused of involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires face trial in absentia",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- An Argentine judge on Thursday ordered that the seven Iranians and three Lebanese citizens accused of involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires face trial in absentia for the first time in the long-running case plagued by setbacks and controversy.",
      "For years Argentine courts have ordered that the suspects \u2014 Iranian former officials and Lebanese nationals \u2014 be apprehended and brought before a judge because Argentina never allowed trials in absentia.",
      "Past efforts to encourage foreign governments to arrest the suspects, including an influential advisor to Iran's supreme leader, on the basis of Interpol red alerts never gained traction.",
      "But right-wing President Javier Milei, a loyal ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and fierce critic of Iran who studies the Torah with a rabbi despite being born Catholic, pushed a bill through Congress earlier this year that authorizes trials in absentia for fugitives that have long sought to evade justice \u2014 allowing Argentina to put the defendants on trial for the first time.",
      "On Thursday, Judge Daniel Rafecas approved the trial in absentia following a request from the special prosecutor\u2019s office responsible for investigating the 1994 attack, the deadliest in the South American country\u2019s history, which killed 85 people two years after a separate bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires killed 22 people.",
      "Rafecas described the trial as the only way to avoid impunity now more than 30 years after the bombing.",
      "\u201cTrial in absentia, however limited, remains a tool that allows us, at the very least, to attempt to uncover the truth, reconstruct what happened, and, above all, give those representing the victims a place to express themselves publicly in this process,\u201d he wrote in his ruling.",
      "Last year, a high court in Argentina ruled that the Iranian government had masterminded the 1994 attack on the center, known by its acronym AMIA, and that members of Lebanon's Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah had carried it out.",
      "Iran has long denied any involvement in the attacks.",
      "Among the seven Iranians who are subject to Argentine arrest warrants are former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, former commander of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Mohsen Rezaei and former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who now advises Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The three Lebanese citizens include Salman Raouf Salman, who allegedly coordinated the attack, and fellow Hezbollah members Abdallah Salman and Hussein Mounir Mouzannar. All have been declared in contempt of court, in some cases decades ago.",
      "Advancing the AMIA case has been a key goal of Milei, who concluded a trip to Jerusalem on June 12, the night before Israel launched its unprecedented air campaign targeting Iran's nuclear sites and military leadership.",
      "Milei escalated his rhetoric against Iran and in support of Israel during the 12-day war between the regional foes, calling the Islamic republic \u201can enemy of Argentina\u201d and praising Israel as \u201csaving Western civilization.\u201d",

      "Guatemala and Honduras have signed agreements with the U.S. to accept asylum seekers from other countries",
      "GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemala and Honduras have signed agreements with the United States to potentially offer refuge to people from other countries who otherwise would seek asylum in the United States, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday at the conclusion of her Central America trip.",
      "The agreements expand the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to provide the U.S. government flexibility in returning migrants not only to their own countries, but also to third countries as it attempts to ramp up deportations.",
      "Noem described it as a way to offer asylum-seekers options other than coming to the United States. She said the agreements had been in the works for months. with the U.S. government applying pressure on Honduras and Guatemala to get them done.",
      "\u201cHonduras and now Guatemala after today will be countries that will take those individuals and give them refugee status as well,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never believed that the United States should be the only option, that the guarantee for a refugee is that they go somewhere to be safe and to be protected from whatever threat they face in their country. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the United States.\u201d",
      "Both governments denied having signed third safe country agreements when asked following Noem's comments.",
      "Guatemala's presidential communications office said the government did not sign a safe third country agreement nor any immigration related agreement during Noem's visit.",
      "They reaffirmed that Guatemala would receive Central Americans sent by the United States as a temporary stop on the return to their countries.",
      "Noem had said Thursday that \u201cpolitically, this is a difficult agreement for their governments to do.\u201d",
      "Both countries have limited resources and many needs making support for asylum seekers from other countries a tougher sell domestically. There are also the optics of two left-of-center governments appearing to help the Trump administration limit access to U.S. asylum.",
      "Noem said that during her Guatemala meeting, she was given the already signed agreement. While later there was a public signing ceremony for a memorandum of understanding that establishes a Joint Security Program that will put U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the Guatemalan capital's international airport to help train local agents to screen for terrorist suspects.",
      "Honduras' immigration director Wilson Paz denied such an agreement was signed and its Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "During U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the U.S. signed such accords called safe-third country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

      "The U.S. has had such an agreement with Canada since 2002.",
      "The practical challenge was that all three Central American countries at the time were seeing large numbers of their own citizens head to the U.S. to escape violence and a lack of economic opportunity. They also had extremely under-resourced asylum systems.",
      "In February, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed deals with El Salvador and Guatemala that allowed the U.S. to send migrants from other nations there. But in Guatemala\u2019s case it was to only be a point of transit for migrants who would then return to their homelands, not to apply for asylum there. And in El Salvador, it was broader, allowing the U.S. to send migrants to be imprisoned there.",
      "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would not sign a third safe country agreement, but at the same time Mexico has accepted more than 5,000 migrants from other countries deported from the U.S. since Trump took office. She said Mexico accepted them for humanitarian reasons and helped them return to their home countries.",
      "The U.S. also has agreements with Panama and Costa Rica to take migrants from other countries though so far the numbers sent have been relatively small. The Trump administration sent 299 to Panama in February and fewer than 200 to Costa Rica.",
      "The agreements give U.S. authorities options, especially for migrants from countries where it is not easy for the U.S. to return them directly.",

      "Unlike in normal shelters, the warming centers allowed homeless people to bring pets and personal belongings and remained open during the daytime.",
      "As much as Bilhere said he dreaded this wintry weather, he feared just as much what would happen when the cold snap passed and the emergency shelters closed.",
      "\u201cMy dream is to have my own home ... and sleep warm,\u201d he said. \u201c I wish that for everyone.\u201d",

      "Herzog's family celebrated the official admission of liability, which involved the government agreeing to pay them compensation.",
      "\u201cThis apology is not merely symbolic,\u201d the journalist\u2019s son, Ivo Herzog, said from the Vladimir Herzog Institute in Sao Paulo, an organization dedicated to preserving his memory. \u201cIt is an act by the state that makes us believe the current Brazilian state doesn\u2019t think like the Brazilian state of that time.\u201d",
      "Under the settlement, the government will pay nearly 3 million Brazilian reais (about $544,800) to the Herzog family as compensation for moral damages. The agreement also includes retroactive payments of a monthly pension to Herzog\u2019s widow, Clarice Herzog, from a prior court order.",

      "Herzog, commonly known by his nickname Vlado, was a Jewish journalist born in 1937 in Osijek, a Yugoslavian city that is now part of Croatia. His family escaped the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941 and settled in Brazil.",

Herzog, who had denied any connection to the Communist Party, walked into the Sao Paulo intelligence headquarters to testify and never came out.",

      "\u201cIn the 2022 election, we stood at a crossroads: Either to reaffirm democracy or move toward the closure of the Brazilian state, with all the horrors we lived through for 21 years,\u201d Messias said.",

      "In 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found Brazil guilty of crimes against humanity for Herzog's killing and prevented the case from expiring under the statute of limitations. The ruling also required the state to acknowledge and formally apologize for the crime but it didn't at the time.",
      "\u201cThis has been a struggle not only of the Herzog family, but of all the families of the murdered and disappeared,\u201d Ivo Herzog said.",

They have to be able to demonstrate that there was actually money laundering, not with words, but with strong evidence.\"",
      "The accused banks also fired back on the orders, rejecting the allegations and similarly citing a lack of evidence.",

      "Manuel Somoza, president of strategies of CIBanco, told local press that they only heard about the order the same time it was made public, and noted that it wasn't a formal legal accusation, but rather an investigation.",
      "\u201cOur books are open,\" he said. \u201dRumors are clearly damaging, whether they\u2019re true or not. So, what we want is for (American authorities) to come and investigate.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said they were notified by American officials of the accusations ahead of the Wednesday announcement, and that Mexican financial regulators carried out their own investigations into the institutions.",
      "They found \"administrative infractions,\" she said, but nothing close to the accusations being levied by Treasury officials.",
      "In the orders blocking transactions between the three institutions and American banks, the Trump administration alleged that the three companies facilitated millions of dollars in transfers with Chinese companies, which it said were used to buy chemicals to produce fentanyl. The Treasury Department said the institutions had facilitated transfers to U.S. banks, but officials would not name which U.S. institutions were implicated nor provide more details.",
      "Sheinbaum countered that their own investigation simply showed that institutions had strong relationships with Chinese clients and banks, which she said was more of an indicator that the two countries share a robust trade relationship. China has been the main source of chemical precursors to produce fentanyl in Mexico, according to U.S. authorities. At the same time, the U.S. has increasingly sought to block growing Chinese influence and investment in Latin America.",
      "The leader also expressed frustration on Thursday morning, reminding Trump officials that Mexico is a sovereign nation and must be treated as an equal by the U.S. government.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A key inflation gauge moved higher in May in the latest sign that prices remain stubbornly elevated while Americans cut back on their spending.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, an increase from 2.5% the previous month. Both figures are modestly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.",
      "At the same time, Americans cut back on spending for the first time since January, as overall spending fell 0.1%.",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Donald Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffsare still having only a modest effect on prices. The costs of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares, and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month\u2019s 0.1%.",
      "The weakness in spending in part likely reflects reduced purchases of cars and other manufactured goods after Americans stepped up their spending on those items this spring to get ahead of tariffs.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hundreds of millions of \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 loans will soon affect credit scores for millions of Americans who use the loans to buy clothing, furniture, concert tickets, and takeout.",
      "Scoring company FICO said Monday that it is rolling out a new model that factors the short-term loans into their consumer scores. A majority of lenders use FICO scores to determine a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness. Previously, the loans had been excluded, though Buy Now, Pay Later company Affirm began voluntarily reporting pay-in-four loans to Experian, a separate credit bureau, in April.",
      "The new FICO scores will be available beginning in the fall, as an option for lenders to increase visibility into consumers' repayment behavior, the company said. Still, not all Buy Now, Pay Later companies share their data with the credit bureaus, and not all lenders will opt in to using the new models, so widespread adoption could take time, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Typically, when using Buy Now, Pay Later loans, consumers pay for a given purchase in four installments over six weeks, in a model more similar to layaway than to a traditional credit card. The loans are marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or only a soft credit check.",
      "The main three credit reporting bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, haven't yet incorporated a standard way of including these new financial products in their reports, since they don't adhere to existing models of lending and repayment. FICO, the score of the Fair Isaac Corporation, uses data from the bureaus to calculate its own credit score, and is independently choosing to pilot a new score that takes the loans into account.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as safer alternatives to credit cards, while consumer advocates warn about \u201cloan stacking,\u201d in which consumers take on many loans at once across several companies. So far, there's been little visibility into this practice in the industry, and the opacity has led to warnings of \u201cphantom debt\" that could mask the health of the consumer.",
      "In a statement, FICO said that their new credit score model is accounting for the growing significance of the loans in the U.S. credit ecosystem.",
      "\u201cBuy Now, Pay Later loans are playing an increasingly important role in consumers\u2019 financial lives,\u201d said Julie May, vice president and general manager of business-to-business scores at FICO. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling lenders to more accurately evaluate credit readiness, especially for consumers whose first credit experience is through BNPL products.\"",
      "FICO said the new model will responsibly expand access to credit. Many users of BNPL loans are younger consumers and consumers who may not have good or lengthy credit histories. In a joint study with Affirm, FICO trained its new scores on a sample of more than 500,000 BNPL borrowers and found that consumers with five or more loans typically saw their scores increase or remain stable under the new model.",
      "For consumers who pay back their BNPL loans in a timely way, the new credit scoring model could help them improve their credit scores, increasing access to mortgages, car loans, and apartment rentals. Currently, the loans don't typically contribute directly to improved scores, though missed payments can hurt or ding a score.",
      "Since March, credit scores have declined steeply for millions, as student loan payments resume and many student borrowers find themselves unable to make regular payments on their federal student loans.",
      "Nadine Chabrier, senior policy and litigation counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said her main concern is that the integration of the loans into a score could have unexpected negative effects on people who are already credit-restrained.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of information out there about how integrating BNPL into credit scoring will work out,\u201d Chabrier said. \u201cFICO simulated the effect on credit scoring through a study. They saw that some users\u2019 scores increased. But if you factor in something that, last week, didn\u2019t affect your credit, and this week, it does, without having very much information about the modeling, it's a little hard to tell what the consequences will be.\u201d",
      "Chabrier cited research that\u2019s shown that many BNPL users have revolving credit card balances, lower credit scores, delinquencies, and existing debt. Women of color are also more likely to use the loans, she said.",
      "\u201cThis is a credit vulnerable community,\u201d said Chabrier.",
      "Rust, of the Consumer Federation of America, said he doesn't expect this to be a game-changer for consumers who already have a credit profile.",
      "\u201cAre we at a point where using BNPL loans will dramatically alter your credit profile? Probably not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it's important that people have reasonable expectations.\u201d",
      "Rust said the average BNPL loan is for $135, and that repaying such small loans, even consistently, might not result in changes to a credit score that would significantly move the needle.",
      "\u201cIt's not about going from 620 to 624. It's about going from 620 to 780,\u201d he said, referring to the kind of credit score jumps that affect one's credit card offers, interest rates on loans, and the like.",
      "Still, Rust said that increased transparency around the loans could create a more accurate picture of a consumer's debts, which could improve accurate underwriting and keep consumers from over-extending themselves.",
      "\u201cThis addresses the problem of \u2018phantom debt,\u2019 and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it could be something that keeps people from getting too deeply into debt they can\u2019t afford.\u201d",

      "The announcement comes as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods. He has slapped 10% tariffs on imports from most countries and put 30% levies on Chinese goods. GE Appliances says nearly all the steel used in its U.S. manufacturing for its appliances comes from American steelmakers.",
      "GE Appliances said the project will move production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers from China to the Bluegrass State. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's sprawling Louisville production complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said. Once the added production is in place, the total area devoted to clothes care production at the Louisville complex will equal 33 football fields, it said.",
      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has criticized Trump's tariffs, hailed the company's deepening commitment to the state.",
      "\u201cToday's announcement brings more appliance manufacturing back to the United States and solidifies Kentucky and Louisville as the global headquarters of GE Appliances,\u201d the governor said.",
      "The redesigned factory will become its most advanced manufacturing plant for clothes washing production, the company said, featuring the latest in automation, robotics and material-handling technologies including automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots.",
      "The new manufacturing lines will open in 2027, the company said.",
      "Next door at the complex's Building 1, the company produces top load washers and front load dryers.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but lacks overall production capacity to make all of its products at its U.S. plants. So it contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and the investment announced Thursday is another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "\u201cManufacturing in Louisville puts production closer to our designers, engineers and consumers so that together we can create our most innovative laundry platforms,\u201d said Lee Lagomarcino, vice president of clothes care at GE Appliances.",
      "The $490 million infusion into Appliance Park is the latest round of investments in recent years as part of the company\u2019s growth strategy. It builds on the company's previous investments of $3.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing in the past decade, with more than one-third of the amount going to Appliance Park.",

      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Republican proposals would have meant $250 billion less for the health care program, \u201cmassive Medicaid cuts that hurt kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities and working families.\u201d",
      "The outcome is a setback as Senate Republicans race toward a weekend session to pass the bill and send it back to the House for another vote before Trump\u2019s Fourth of July deadline. Trump hosted House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP lawmakers in the East Room at the White House, joined by truck drivers, firefighters, tipped workers, ranchers and others that the administration says will benefit from the bill.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have grandstanders,\u201d Trump said of the GOP holdouts.",
      "Trump said there are \u201chundreds of things\u201d in the emerging package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered money to carry out his mass deportation plans. \u201cIt's so good.\u201d",
      "At its core, the big bill, which has passed the House and is now being revised in the Senate, includes $3.8 trillion in tax breaks that had been approved during Trump's first term but will expire in December, imposing a tax hike if Congress fails to act. To help offset lost revenues, Republicans are relying on steep cuts to health care and food stamps, and imposing new fees on immigrants.",
      "GOP leaders were already struggling to rally support for Medicaid changes that some senators said went too far and would have left millions without coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said more than 10.9 million more people would not have health care under the House-passed bill; Senate Republicans were proposing deeper cuts.",
      "After the parliamentarian advised against the Medicaid provider tax change, Republicans said they would try to revise the provision to make it acceptable, perhaps by extending the start date of any changes. They are rushing to come up with similar adjustments to other proposals that have run into violations, including one to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.",
      "It's all delaying action on the bill, but Republican leaders have little choice. They are counting on the health care restrictions to save billions of dollars and offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Budget Committee chairman, rejected calls to fire the parliamentarian, and said in a statement he was working with the office to \u201cfind a pathway forward.\u201d",
      "States impose the so-called provider tax on hospitals and other entities as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics say the system is a type of \u201claundering,\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the tax, while the Senate would cut the tax that some states are allowed to impose.",
      "Several GOP senators have opposed cutting the Medicaid provider tax, saying it would hurt rural hospitals that depend on the money. Hospital organizations have warned that it could lead to hospital closures.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., among those fighting the change, said he had spoken to Trump late Wednesday and the president told him to revert to the earlier proposal from the House.",
      "\u201cI think it just confirms that we weren\u2019t ready for a vote yet,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who also had raised concerns about the provider tax cuts.",
      "More than 80 million people in the United States use the Medicaid program, alongside the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Republicans want to scale Medicaid back to what they say is its original mission, providing care mainly to women and children, rather than a much larger group of people.",
      "To help defray lost revenues to the hospitals, one plan Republicans had been considering would have created a rural hospital fund with $15 billion as backup. Some GOP senators said that was too much; others, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, wanted at least $100 billion.",
      "The parliamentarian has worked around the clock to assess the legislation and ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. It essentially bars policy matters in budget reconciliation bills.",
      "If leaders moved ahead without altering the provisions, the measures could be challenged, requiring a 60-vote threshold to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate divided 53-47 and with Democrats unified against Trump's bill.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty frustrating,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who wants even steeper reductions.",
      "Overnight Wednesday the parliamentarian advised against GOP student loan repayment plans, and Thursday the parliamentarian cited those that would have blocked access to Medicaid and other health care programs from immigrants who are not citizens. Earlier, plans to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were also found to violate the rules.",
      "But Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said there's no desire to challenge the parliamentarian's advice. \u201cIt's the institutional integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I'm convinced 100% she's wrong.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republicans lost another potential revenue source Thursday after agreeing to a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to remove the so-called revenge tax provision, section 899, that would have allowed the government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners and investors from certain countries. Bessent said he has reached a separate agreement with such countries.",

      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit planet-warming carbon dioxide are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.",
      "The process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.",
      "But it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.",
      "Here's a closer look:",
      "Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.",
      "Industries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped \u2014 usually through a pipeline \u2014 to a location where it\u2019s injected deep underground for long-term storage.",
      "Carbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.",
      "Lauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp., which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.",
      "The carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves \u2014 meaning it's not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60% of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.",
      "Some companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90% or more, \u201cin practice, that has never happened,\u201d said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project\u2019s Oil & Gas Watch.",
      "That's because it's difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it's emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Environmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.",
      "Carbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it's less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.",
      "A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that\u2019s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.",
      "About 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.",
      "It's an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission\u2019s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.",
      "The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world's largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil\u2019s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.",
      "Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a substitution for renewables ... it\u2019s just a complementary technology,\u201d Nepal said. \u201cIt\u2019s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.\u201d",
      "Experts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won't be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.",
      "They remain in the Senate Finance Committee's draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.",

      "Jobless claims for the week ended June 21 dropped 10,000 to 236,000, a historically-low level. The four-week average of claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, dipped 750 to 245,000.",
      "Applications for unemployment aid are a proxy for layoffs, and so the decline is evidence that businesses are mostly holding onto their employees. Yet separate data suggests hiring also remains cool, in what economists are referring to as a \u201cno hire, no fire\u201d job market.",
      "The unemployment rate remains low, though there are signs that the economy is slowing. So far this year, employers have added a solid but unspectacular 124,000 jobs a month, down from an average 168,000 last year. Most of the hiring has been concentrated in a few industries, specifically health care, restaurants and hotels, and government. Layoffs have mostly remained low, but hiring has also been weak.",
      "Yet for many job-seekers, the sluggish creation of new jobs has been a challenge. Recent college graduates are facing the toughest job market in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for grads aged 22 to 27 is now higher than the overall jobless rate, and the gap between the two is the widest it has been in more than 30 years.",
      "The difficulty many of the unemployed are having in finding work can be seen in the number of people continuing to claim unemployment aid, which rose 37,000 to 1.97 million for the week ending June 14. That is the most since November 2021.",
      "Separately, the economy shrank 0.5% at an annual rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday, a worse showing than its previous estimate of a 0.2% decline. A flood of imports swamped the economy as companies rushed to bring in foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs took effect.",

This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",

The Commerce Department previously estimated that the economy fell 0.2% in the first quarter. Economists had forecast no change in the department's third and final estimate.",

Imports expanded 37.9%, fastest since 2020, and pushed GDP down by nearly 4.7 percentage points.",

      "The European Union is reassessing its ties with China strained relations with the United States",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Jilted, betrayed, dumped, or defiant. It's hard to describe the European Union after relentless attacks from its once-dependable ally, the United States. The threat from Donald Trump's second administration against Greenland, its sweeping tariff plans and courtship of Moscow have firmed up some European leaders\u2019 vows to reduce their reliance on America.",
      "That has not gone unnoticed in another global power. China hopes for a Europe detached from the U.S. and is sensing an opportunity now to divide the West. For the past several years, the EU moved in lockstep with Washington to levy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and sanction Chinese officials accused of rights violations.",
      "Now, locked in a trade war with Washington that may be prolonged, Beijing sees the 27-nation bloc as a desirable partner in blunting the impact from Trump\u2019s tariffs and to maintain its strong global position.",
      "But for EU leaders, meeting Thursday in Brussels to discuss China among a host of regional and global issues, managing ties with Beijing is no easy matter.",
      "An upcoming summit in China in July to mark 50 years of ties might offer the first hint of new consensus between these two global behemoths.",

      "China is the EU\u2019s second largest trading partner in goods, after the United States. Both China and the EU believe it is in their interest to keep their trade ties stable for the sake of the global economy, and they share certain climate goals.",
      "Like the U.S., Europe runs a massive trade deficit with China: around 300 billion euros last year. It relies heavily on China for critical minerals, which are also used to make magnets used in cars and appliances. As European companies are seeing declining profitability in China, Brussels is hoping Beijing will follow through on recent pledges, like one announced Thursday by the Ministry of Commerce, to ease restrictions on foreign business ventures.",
      "\u201cWhile other opened their market, China focused undercutting intellectual property protections, massive subsidies with the aim to dominate global manufacturing and supply chains,\u201d said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the G7 meeting in Canada. \u201cThis is not market competition \u2013 it is distortion with intent.\"",
      "Now, Europe, already fretting over the trade deficit, worries that Trump's tariffs could divert even more Chinese goods to Europe, destabilizing markets across the continent.",
      "Such vulnerabilities could strengthen Beijing's negotiating position, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, a China analyst with the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.",
      "\u201cChina has built so many strategic dependencies that the EU is trapped in an asymmetric relationship,\u201d she said, and Beijing could leverage them to \u201cget a deal in July\" at the summit.",
      "Analysts don\u2019t expect a grand bargain at the summit, but China will likely demand the EU lift tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles or even reopen the bilateral trade treaty, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment. Either or both would send a powerful signal to Washington.",
      "But China's main goal is ensuring the EU remains an accessible and affluent market for goods that might not reach the U.S. because of Trump\u2019s tariff blitzkrieg. Despite a truce in the trade war, Chinese businesses are widening their global reach to be less dependent on the U.S.",
      "Regardless of any deal, the summit itself will be the message, said Noah Barkin, an analyst of Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank. For the EU, the main goal would be for von der Leyen to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said.",
      "Whereas she was \u201ctreated rather shabbily\u201d on a 2023 trip to Beijing, Barkin said the Chinese this time will probably \u201croll out the red carpet,\" keen to see \u201cpictures of Chinese and European leaders walking through gardens and sending a message of unity.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is precisely because most European decision-makers realize the necessity of strategic autonomy that they have made it clear that they must strengthen cooperation with China,\" said Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, to The Paper, a Shanghai-based news site.",

Czech intelligence services have claimed Beijing directed cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure. And the EU\u2019s criticisms of China\u2019s human rights violations remain unabated.",

      "The EU recently cancelled a high-level economic and trade dialogue with China, due to a lack of progress on trade disputes. It also has moved to restrict Chinese participation in EU medical devices procurement.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called out Spain for its courtship of China, warning that countries seeking to get closer to China would be \u201ccutting their own throat\u201d because Chinese factories will be looking to dump goods that they can\u2019t ship to the U.S.",
      "By decoupling their positions on China, analysts say both Brussels and Washington have weaker hands dealing with Beijing. And that might hurt the U.S., which has vowed to prevail over China and retain its global dominance but, as many believe, needs help from its allies and partners.",

      "Carnegie Corp. of New York's 2025 class of Great Immigrants, Great Americans include composer and conductor Tania Le\u00f3n, last year's Nobel Prize winner in economics Simon Johnson, and Voto Latino CEO Maria Teresa Kumar",
      "Tania Le\u00f3n, the noted composer and conductor who also co-founded Dance Theatre of Harlem, never planned on emigrating to the United States. She wanted to move to Paris.",
      "When Le\u00f3n received the opportunity to leave Cuba on a resettlement flight to Miami in 1967, she took it, thinking she would eventually end up settling in France where she would join the Conservatoire de Paris and become a concert pianist. Instead, she moved to New York and within months met Arthur Mitchell, the New York City Ballet dancer who achieved international acclaim and integrated the art form as its first Black star.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the future,\u201d Le\u00f3n told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cBy a chance moment, I bumped into the man that in a way changed my life\u2026 and then he spoke to me about the creation of something that he had in mind that later on became the Dance Theatre of Harlem and then I was involved in all of this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of this\u201d \u2013 her composing, her conducting of the New York Philharmonic, her work on Broadway \u2013 led to Le\u00f3n being honored Thursday by the Carnegie Corp. of New York as part of its 20th class of Great Immigrants, Great Americans.",
      "\u201cI am just overwhelmed with this latest recognition about what I have been able to contribute because I didn\u2019t do it with the purpose of gaining awards and things like that,\u201d Leon said. \u201cI think that one has to convey the gratitude for the opportunities that I have received since I arrived.\"",
      "The 20 members of this year\u2019s class of Great Immigrants, Great Americans represent a wide range of immigration journeys, but they share a desire to give back to the country that has become their home. What the Carnegie initiative celebrates is also how American immigrants have improved their country.",
      "\u201cFor 20 years, our Great Immigrants public awareness initiative has been a reminder that many of the most influential figures in our country have been distinguished naturalized citizens, like our founder Andrew Carnegie, born in Scotland,\u201d Carnegie President Dame Louise Richardson -- also a naturalized American citizen, born in Ireland -- said in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. is a nation of immigrants and our ongoing support of nonpartisan organizations that help establish legal pathways for citizenship continues to enrich the very fabric of American life.\u201d",
      "British-born Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management professor Simon Johnson, another honoree from this year\u2019s Great Immigrants class, said immigrants have also enriched the American economy.",
      "\u201cIf people come to the United States, with very few exceptions, they come because they want to work,\u201d said Johnson, who won the 2024 Nobel memorial prize in economics with two other American immigrants, Turkish-born Daron Acemoglu and fellow Brit, James Robinson. \u201cThey want to work hard. They want to be productive. They want to improve their lives and have better futures for their kids\u2026 That dynamism we have is a big part of what\u2019s going well in many parts of the U.S.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the immigrant perspective helped the team on its prize-winning study, which studied countries and found that freer, open societies are more likely to prosper. And the support that academia in the United States provides is also helpful.",
      "\u201cAmerican universities have incredible opportunities -- lots of time for research, really interesting teaching, great students -- it\u2019s an amazing combination,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been incredibly lucky because it\u2019s a space that allows you to work hard and get lucky.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s honorees are named as immigration becomes an increasingly contentious issue. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is looking to add $150 billion to support his mass deportation agenda, which has drawn protests, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to arrest 3,000 people in the country illegally each day.",
      "Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of the civic engagement nonprofit Voto Latino and another of Carnegie\u2019s 2024 honorees, said the anti-immigration sentiment is painful on so many levels.",
      "\u201cA multicultural America is our secret superpower,\u201d said Kumar, who emigrated from Colombia with her family when she was four years old. \u201cThere are plenty of people in foreign interference that try to divide our country around race and status because they know that multiculturally, when human capital is what\u2019s going to determine the 21st Century, we are truly unstoppable\u2026 It\u2019s that diversity and value of thought that makes us really strong. And what\u2019s happening right now seems like we are impeding our progress because we\u2019re not seeing the bigger picture.\u201d",
      "Kumar and Voto Latino have been outspoken with their criticism of the Trump administration and have directed some of their resources toward keeping immigrants informed of their rights and offering advice to deal with ICE raids.",
      "Geri Mannion, managing director of Carnegie\u2019s Strengthening U.S. Democracy Program, which oversees the Great Immigrants, Great American awards and other civic participation initiatives, said they will continue handing out the awards because immigrants help the United States on multiple levels.",
      "Carnegie is also marking the 20th anniversary with a free comic book that celebrates the lives of previous honorees, including Rock and Roll Hall of Famer David Byrne, Peabody Award-winning comedian Mo Amer, and Jim Lee, the chief creative officer of the DC comics universe. The comic will also be used by the National Council of Teachers of English to develop lesson plans and other educational resources.",
      "\u201cIn other countries, you could be there three generations, but you might be seen still seen as the other,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., you\u2019re considered American the moment you take that oath. And nobody thinks twice about it.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014-",
      "Carnegie Corp. of New York\u2019s 2025 Class of Great Immigrants, Great Americans is: Calendly founder and CEO, Tope Awotona, originally from Nigeria; Moungi Bawendi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of chemistry (France); Helen M.

      "Investigators have started analyzing data from the black boxes of the Air India Boeing 787 that crashed two weeks ago, killing at least 270 people",
      "NEW DELHI -- Investigators have begun analyzing data extracted from the black boxes of the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner that crashed about two weeks ago, killing at least 270 people, India\u2019s civil aviation ministry said on Thursday.",
      "The data is crucial as it will help shed light on the cause of the country's worst aviation disaster in recent memory.",
      "A team led by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, or AAIB, has started looking at the data with support from the U.S. National Transport Safety Board, the ministry said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThese efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Indian investigators recovered the black boxes from the wreckage site in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, a couple of days after the London-bound Air India flight 171 struck a residential area minutes after takeoff. The crash killed 241 people onboard and at least 29 on the ground. There was one survivor.",
      "The so-called \u201cblack box\u201d is one of the most important pieces of forensic evidence following a plane crash. There are typically two sturdy devices, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. And they\u2019re typically orange, not black.",
      "Indian authorities flew the black boxes from Ahmedabad to the national capital in an Indian Air Force aircraft amid tight security early this week. The investigation could take weeks or months.",
      "India set up a state-of-the-art laboratory in New Delhi in April to help AAIB repair damaged black boxes and retrieve data to enhance the accuracy of investigations.",
      "A multidisciplinary team led by AAIB Chief GVG Yugandhar is probing the Air India crash with assistance from aviation and air traffic control specialists and experts from the National Transport Safety Board.",
      "The Indian government has also set up a separate, high-level committee to examine the causes leading to the crash and formulate procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future. The committee is expected to file a preliminary report within three months.",
      "Following the June 12 crash, Indian authorities had ordered deeper checks of Air India\u2019s entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner to prevent future incidents.",
      "Air India has 33 Dreamliner in its fleet. Inspection has been completed for at least 26 while four were undergoing long-term maintenance. The rest were expected to finish the safety checks soon.",

      "Greenland is covered in ice and snow, and its locals retreat indoors for most of the year",
      "NUUK, Greenland -- For most of the year, Greenland is covered in ice and snow and its locals retreat indoors. But for three short months beginning in June, everyone heads outside \u2014 day and night \u2014 to watch or play soccer, the island's favorite sport.",
      "On an island of roughly 56,000 people, about 5,500 \u2014 nearly 10% of the population \u2014 are registered soccer players. So it was a crushing blow in early June when the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, or CONCACAF, unanimously rejected the Greenlandic Football Association\u2019s application to become a member.",
      "Some blamed politics for the decision in light of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated wish to take control of the strategic, mineral-rich island. CONCACAF is one of six continental federations under FIFA, soccer\u2019s world governing body that oversees the World Cup.",
      "The U.S. president hasn't ruled out military force despite strong rebukes from the governments of Denmark, a NATO ally, and Greenland. Danish and Greenlandic leaders say the island is not for sale and have condemned reports of the U.S. stepping up intelligence gathering on the semiautonomous Danish territory.",
      "But Patrick Frederiksen, captain of the national team, thinks CONCACAF\u2019s rejection came down to money.",
      "\u201cWe all know it\u2019s really expensive to travel to Greenland,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier this month, the first direct flight from the U.S. to Greenland by an American airline landed in the capital, Nuuk. The one-way ticket from Newark International Airport in New Jersey cost roughly $1,200. The return flight from Nuuk had a $1,300 to $1,500 price tag. Other flights require a layover in Iceland or Copenhagen, Denmark.",
      "CONCACAF didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Greenland, technically European territory, might have been expected to seek membership in UEFA. But the European federation only allows members from countries recognized as independent per sovereignty rules introduced in 2007. CONCACAF has no such restrictions.",
      "Despite the recent headlines, the Arctic island's inhabitants are more concerned this summer with getting to the nearest field. They want to take advantage of the 24-hour sunlight even if the temperatures hover around 5 to 10 degrees Celsius (41 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) in Nuuk.",
      "\u201cWe meet outside and play football all night long,\u201d player Angutimmarik Kreutzmann said. \"It\u2019s not getting dark and we have so much freedom.\u201d",
      "From youth clubs to the national team, soccer energizes the entire island.",
      "Picturesque outdoor fields, featuring views of drifting icebergs and snow-capped mountain peaks even in late June, range from artificial turf to dirt to real grass, though older players remember dribbling across gravel pitches.",
      "\u201cYou should come watch a game,\u201d said Oscar Scott Carl, coach of the B-67 club in Nuuk. \u201cYou can see how much people go into the game, how much cheering from the attenders.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also a big part of creating unity in the country, having a sport to gather around and celebrate wins and being a part of something bigger than only football, to be honest,\u201d he added.",
      "The Kalaallit Arsaattartut Kattuffiat, Greenland's national football association, was founded in 1971 and regulates multiple men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Community projects are also important to the island's soccer culture and national team players serve as role models for local youth.",
      "\u201cThey want to take pictures with us or get our autograph,\u201d Frederiksen said. \u201cWe get a lot of attention and a lot support from the kids.\u201d",
      "During the long winter, many players turn to futsal. The sport is a form of indoor soccer, generally played with a special ball on a handball court with five players on a side.",
      "Even the national team plays: They traveled to Brazil in March for the Intercontinental Futsal Cup.",
      "The national team of the Faeroe Islands, a semi-independent Danish territory in the North Atlantic, is a member of FIFA and UEFA, which oversees European soccer.",
      "It's a sore spot for Greenlanders, especially after CONCACAF's decision. The Faeroe Islands team joined the tournaments more than three decades ago, before there were requirements such as a stadium with tens of thousands of seats, among others.",
      "Visit Greenland, the government's tourism agency, said that a national stadium has \"long been on the wish list for many in Greenland.\" But with such a small population, an arena with a minimum of 40,000 seats \u2014 more than 70% of the island's inhabitants \u2014 \u201cis sadly not in the pipeline,\u201d the agency wrote on its website.",
      "Still, Jimmy Holm Jensen, chairman of Nuuk's B-67 club, wishes Greenland's teams could at least play in international soccer tournaments. Right now, they only can compete in friendly matches abroad.",

      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has signed a controversial labor reform into law, delivering a significant increase in worker protections",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro signed into law on Wednesday a controversial labor overhaul with the potential to profoundly shift the balance of power from employers to workers, a key victory for the left-wing leader even as Congress compelled him to scale back his more radical ambitions.",
      "The enactment of the law marks a milestone for a president who has struggled to deliver on his promises to reduce inequality in one of the region's most unequal nations. But it's faced opposition from business leaders and Colombian government bonds have suffered as markets worry about the fiscal and economic effects.",
      "The law increases overtime pay for salaried workers and limits the use of short-term contract workers, while requiring companies to provide medical coverage and social security for gig workers like food delivery drivers. It also promises student interns proper contracts and benefits like vacation time and severance pay.",
      "Many of Petro\u2019s efforts to vastly expand social programs have stalled in Congress, with lawmakers shooting down this labor law twice. Lawmakers let the legislation squeak by last week after Petro\u2019s moved to call a public referendum.",
      "Petro signed the legislation at the historic home of 19th-century war hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who led South America's fight against imperial Spain.",

      "The reform was cheered by trade unions and Petro\u2019s political allies Wednesday.",
      "But his push to strengthen worker protections has proved controversial, as the expensive benefits are expected to hike up costs for business owners. Petro\u2019s government has promised to push through a new bill to help small businesses, though the details remain unclear.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have painted a nightmare scenario of mass layoffs that will push more workers into Colombia\u2019s already vast informal economy.",
      "Many say that the mandated reductions in working hours, increases in overtime pay for Sunday and holiday shifts will especially squeeze small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "Already, his government\u2019s increased spending and reduced tax income have challenged fiscal stability.",
      "Critics also say that the changes won\u2019t help informal workers without contracts, who represent over half of Colombia\u2019s total labor force, according to the latest figures. The legislation guarantees health and pension benefits for only some gig workers, such as app-based delivery workers.",
      "Then there\u2019s the question of compliance. \u201cI want to tell those employers who say they won\u2019t implement the labor reform that they\u2019re not intelligent,\u201d Petro said on Wednesday.",
      "Even as he hailed the law, it fell short of Petro's ambitions. He was forced to compromise on some key provisions to push it through a hostile Congress.",
      "Provisions stripped from the final version included extended paternity leave, paid leave for women with debilitating menstrual pain and some collective bargaining rights for unions.",
      "The signing of the law comes at a tumultuous time for the third largest nation in Latin America, with a wave of bombing attacks shaking the northeast and an assassination attempt on conservative presidential hopeful and senator Miguel Uribe stunning the country. Uribe remains in intensive care.",

      "European Union leaders are calling for greater efforts to help meet Ukraine\u2019s pressing military needs",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders on Thursday called for even greater efforts to help meet Ukraine's pressing military needs, and expressed support for the country's quest to join their ranks, but they made little headway with new sanctions against Russia.",
      "At a summit in Brussels, the leaders said it was important to deliver more \u201cair defense and anti-drone systems, and large-caliber ammunition, to help Ukraine, as it exercises its inherent right to self-defense, to protect its citizens and territory against Russia\u2019s intensified daily attacks.\u201d",
      "They also underlined the need to help support Ukraine's defense industry, which can make weapons and ammunition more quickly and cheaply than its European counterparts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in the meeting via videolink.",
      "Russian forces have made slow gains at some points on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, but it has been costly in terms of troop casualties and damaged equipment. The outnumbered Ukrainian army has relied heavily on drones to keep the Russians back.",
      "Months of U.S.-led international efforts to stop the more than three years of war have failed. As hostilities have ground on, the two sides have continued to swap prisoners of war.",
      "The leaders said the bloc \u201cremains steadfast in its support for Ukraine\u2019s path towards EU membership.\u201d That message comes a day after NATO leaders refrained from putting a reference to Ukraine's hopes of joining the military organization in their summit statement, due in large part to U.S. resistance.",
      "The EU is working on yet another raft of sanctions against Russia, but the leaders made little headway. A key aim is to make further progress in blocking Russia's \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of oil tankers and their operators from earning more revenue for Moscow's war effort.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. More than 2,400 officials and entities \u2013 usually government agencies, banks and organizations \u2013 have been hit.",
      "The statement on Ukraine was agreed by 26 of the 27 member countries. Hungary objected, as it has often done. At a NATO summit on Wednesday, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said that \u201cNATO has no business in Ukraine. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, neither Russia. My job is to keep it as it is.\u201d",
      "The leaders also heard from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on ongoing trade talks with the U.S. aimed at warding off President Donald Trump\u2019s threat of new tariffs, or import taxes, on European goods coming into the US.",
      "Von der Leyen said at a post-summit news conference that she and Trump had agreed at the Group of Seven summit \u201cto speed up the work\u201d ahead of a July 9 deadline. Trump at first laid out a 20% tariff and then threatened to raise that to 50% after expressing dissatisfaction with the pace of talks. Those would come in addition to a 25% tariff on cars from all countries and 50% on steel from all countries, measures that would hit the EU\u2019s auto industry.",
      "Von der Leyen said that Europe had received the latest proposal from the U.S. and was analyzing it. She said the commission, which handles trade for the 27 EU member states, preferred a deal but was also preparing a list of U.S. goods that could be hit with \u201crebalancing\u201d tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe are ready for a deal,\u201d she said. \"At the same time, we are preparing for the possibility that no satisfactory agreement is reached, this is why we consulted on a rebalancing list and we will defend the European interest as needed, in short, all options remain on the table.\u201d",
      "Trump has rejected an EU offer of zero tariffs on both industrial goods and cars, while the EU has rejected changes in the regulation of digital companies and in its national value-added taxes, which economists say are trade neutral because they are levied on imports and domestic goods alike.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said he told Trump in a phone call during the EU summit that the Europeans were \u201cwilling to find an agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we don\u2019t want to reach a deal at all costs,\u201d Macron warned. U.S. tariffs would \u201cinevitably\u201d lead to retaliatory measures on U.S. goods on the European market, he said.",
      "The trade issue is crucial for the EU\u2019s trade dependent economy; the commission\u2019s forecast for modest growth of 0.9% in GDP this year was based on an assumption the EU could negotiate its tariff down to Trump\u2019s 10% baseline minimum for almost all trade partners.",
      "In other developments, the EU leaders deplored \u201cthe dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, the unacceptable number of civilian casualties and the levels of starvation.\u201d They called \u201con Israel to fully lift its blockade.\u201d",
      "They also said that their European Council \u201ctakes note\u201d of a report saying that there are signs that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza are violating human rights obligations in an agreement governing EU-Israel ties. The report was debated by EU foreign ministers on Monday, but the bloc is divided over what to do about it.",
      "The ministers will discuss the issue again at their next meeting on July 15. Suspending ties, including on trade, would require a unanimous decision, which is likely impossible to obtain from staunch backers of Israel like Austria, Germany and Hungary.",
      "The head of the main Greens party group in the European Parliament, Bas Eickhout said that \u201cthe EU is losing all credibility in light of the devastating conflicts raging in the Middle East,\u201d and insisted that the Association Agreement must be suspended.",

      "North Korea will open a tourist site on its east coast next week that it called a prelude to a new era in its tourism industry, though there is no word on when the country will fully reopen to foreign visitors",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea next week will open a signature tourist site on its east coast that it called a prelude to a new era in its tourism industry, though there is no word on when the country will fully reopen its borders to foreign visitors.",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone has hotels and other accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests who can swim in the sea, play sports and other recreation activities and eat at restaurants and cafeterias on site, state media said.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un toured the site and cut the inaugural tape at a lavish ceremony Tuesday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported Thursday. He said its construction would be recorded as \u201cone of the greatest successes this year\" and called the site \u201cthe proud first step\u201d toward realizing the government's policy of developing tourism, according to KCNA.",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma zone will begin service for domestic tourists next Tuesday, KCNA said. But it didn't say when it will start receiving foreign tourists.",
      "Kim has been pushing to make the country a tourism hub as part of efforts to revive the ailing economy, and the Wonsan-Kalma zone is one of his most talked-about tourism projects. KCNA reported North Korea will confirm plans to build large tourist sites in other parts of the country, too.",
      "But North Korea hasn't fully lifted the travel curbs, including a ban on foreign tourists, that were imposed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Starting from February 2024, North Korea has been accepting Russian tourists amid the booming military and other partnerships between the two countries, but Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled.",
      "In February this year, a small group of international tourists visited the country for the first time in five years, but tourist agencies said in March that their tours to North Korea were paused.",

      "The 2025 edition of Wimbledon brings several milestone anniversaries with it",
      "LONDON -- A look at some of the anniversaries this year at Wimbledon:",
      "Arthur Ashe became the first \u2014 and to this day, only \u2014 Black man to win the singles title at Wimbledon in 1975, beating defending champion Jimmy Connors 6\u20131, 6\u20131, 5\u20137, 6\u20134 in the final. Also that year, Billie Jean King easily won her sixth \u2014 and, it turned out, last \u2014 singles championship at the All England Club, defeating Evonne Goolagong 6-0, 6-1. It also was the 19th of the 20 total Wimbledon trophies (across singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles) that King would win.",
      "Bjorn Borg earned his fifth consecutive Wimbledon trophy in 1980, barely getting past rival John McEnroe 1\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20133, 6\u20137 (16), 8\u20136 in a final immediately \u2014 and still \u2014 considered one of the greatest tennis matches of all time. The fourth-set tiebreaker alone, known as The War of 1816, is still discussed with reverence.",
      "Anne White showed up for her first-round Wimbledon match in 1985 against Pam Shriver wearing a full white bodysuit that drew plenty of attention \u2014 and criticism. After they split the first two sets, play was called because of darkness. During the break, White was told that the All England Club did not love her original outfit, even if it did comply with the all-white rule, and she wound up wearing more traditional clothing for the third set when action resumed the next day. Shriver won the match.",
      "A 6-4, 6-1 victory over Zina Garrison in the 1990 final gave Martina Navratilova her record ninth Wimbledon championship. It also was her 18th and last Grand Slam title, equaling rival Chris Evert for the Open era record at the time.",
      "Pete Sampras' 2000 Wimbledon title, via a 6\u20137 (10), 7\u20136 (5), 6\u20134, 6\u20132 victory over Patrick Rafter in the final, gave the American his seventh, and last, trophy at the All England Club and his then-record 13th title from all Grand Slam tournaments. Sampras would win his 14th major at the 2002 U.S. Open, then walk away from the sport. That stood as the men's record until Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic all surpassed it.",
      "John Isner and Nicolas Mahut played the longest tennis match on record at Wimbledon in 2010, competing for 11 hours, 5 minutes stretched across three days in the first round at the All England Club, until Isner eventually prevailed 70-68 in the fifth set. That was part of the impetus for rules changes that eventually mandated tiebreakers at 6-all in fifth sets of men's matches (and third sets of women's matches) at all four Grand Slam tournaments.",
      "Serena Williams completed her second self-styled \u201cSerena Slam\u201d \u2014 four Grand Slam titles in a row, although not all within a single season \u2014 by winning Wimbledon in 2015. Her 6-4, 6-4 victory over Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in the final made the 33-year-old Williams the oldest woman to win a major singles championship in the Open era. It also set up Williams for a bid at a true Grand Slam \u2014 going 4 for 4 at the majors within one calendar year \u2014 at the U.S. Open later in 2015. She fell just short, losing to Roberta Vinci in a stunning upset in the semifinals in New York.",
      "Wimbledon was called off in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first time since World War II that the oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament wasn't held. The cancellation was announced in April, with Britain under a nationwide lockdown. Roger Federer offered a one-word commentary on social media, writing simply: \u201cDevastated.\u201d",

      "The singles brackets for the grass-court Grand Slam tournament were set in Friday's draw, including potential men's quarterfinals of No. 1 Jannik Sinner against No. 7 Lorenzo Musetti, No. 4 Jack Draper against No. 6 Novak Djokovic \u2014 who has won seven of his 24 major trophies at the All England Club \u2014 No. 2 Alcaraz against No. 8 Holger Rune, and No. 3 Alexander Zverev against No. 5 Taylor Fritz.",

He reached his first major quarterfinal at the French Open by defeating Draper \u2014 his potential third-round opponent next week \u2014 and then won a grass-court title at Halle, Germany, for the second time, beating Sinner along the way.",
      "Alcaraz and Sinner could only meet at Wimbledon in the July 13 final, which would be rematch of their epic showdown for the French Open title won by the 22-year-old Alcaraz for his fifth major trophy.",
      "In Fognini, Alcaraz faces a 38-year-old veteran who has been ranked as high as No. 9 and was a French Open quarterfinalist in 2011 but is currently No. 130 and never has been past the third round in 14 previous appearances at Wimbledon.",
      "Fognini, who is married to 2015 U.S. Open champion Flavia Pennetta, has described himself as a hot-head and is known for mid-match flareups, including at Wimbledon, where he was fined $3,000 in 2019 for saying he wished \u201ca bomb would explode at the club\u201d during a third-round loss and a then-record $27,500 in 2014 for a series of outbursts during a first-round victory. He was put on a two-year probation by the Grand Slam Board in 2017 after insulting a female chair umpire at the U.S. Open and getting kicked out of that tournament.",
      "Gauff, coming off her second major title at the French Open, will open Wimbledon on Tuesday against Dayana Yastremska, a 2024 Australian Open semifinalist.",
      "Win that, and Gauff might face former No. 1 and two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka in the second round, while a rematch with No. 28 seed Sofia Kenin could await in the third. Kenin eliminated Gauff in the opening round at Wimbledon two years ago.",
      "Sabalenka, the runner-up to Gauff at Roland-Garros three weeks ago, finds herself in an intriguing quarter of the women's bracket. Sabalenka, who owns three Slam titles, begins against Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine, and could meet 2024 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Lulu Sun in the second round and 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third.",
      "Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova begins Tuesday's Centre Court schedule against Alexandra Eala, who is the first woman representing the Philippines to be ranked inside the top 100 and upset Swiatek on the way to reaching the Miami Open semifinals in March.",

      "COMMERCE CITY, Colo. -- Rose Lavelle scored in her first national team match of the year after ankle surgery and the United States defeated Ireland 4-0 on Thursday night.",
      "Avery Patterson, Sam Coffey and Alyssa Thompson also scored for the United States. Lavelle last played for the national team in December against the Netherlands.",
      "Patterson, making her third start for the national team, scored on a header off a short corner from Lavelle in the 18th minute. It was her first international goal.",
      "\u201cIt's surreal. I think at halftime someone asked me what was going through my head, and I don't think I fully came down and realized what had happened until two water breaks afterward,\u201d Patterson laughed. \u201cI need to watch it again because I kind of blacked out.\u201d",
      "Coffey added a goal before halftime, with a shot that cut across to the far post. It was her third national team goal and second in the last three games.",
      "Lavelle made it 3-0 in the 53rd , scoring handily off a well-placed pass from Ally Sentnor. Thompson ran the ball from the center line, danced around a defender and finished with a blast from atop the box in the 63rd.",
      "\u201cI felt that pressure was coming so I took a touch around her, I've been in that situation a lot of times in this game, and I was like `I need to score this one,'\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo I did my usual move and then hit it to the far side.\u201d",
      "Coach Emma Hayes gave her Europe-based players \u2014 including Lindsey Heaps, Catarina Macario, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox \u2014 time off after their seasons. The exception was defender Naomi Girma, who is working her way back from a calf injury.",
      "Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, who plays for the Seattle Reign, and Lilly Reale, a defender for Gotham, started for the United States in their national team debuts. The youngest player on the squad, 18-year-old Jordyn Bugg, made her debut as a second-half substitute. Six of the 11 starters had less than 10 appearances with the national team.",
      "Lavelle, with 111 appearances on the team, was one of the veterans in the lineup, along with defender Emily Sonnett.",
      "The United States has faced Ireland 16 times and never dropped a match. The Irish have scored just one goal against the United States.",
      "The United States plays Ireland again on Sunday in Cincinnati, Lavelle's hometown. The team plays Canada on July 2 in Washington, D.C.",

      "The 29-year-old Canning, who allowed one hit and struck out three Thursday, immediately began hopping on his right leg and took only a couple steps before dropping onto the field with his left leg elevated.

      "Canning is the third member of the Mets\u2019 opening day rotation to get hurt in the last two weeks \u2014 a stretch in which New York has gone just 4-10.",

Two years ago, it made reinstatement policies more lenient and the NCAA has a multi-year partnership with Genius Sports, which distributes official NCAA data to licensed sportsbooks, an arrangement that bars negative prop bets.",
      "\u201cNCAA rules prohibiting sports betting at all levels were written and adopted at a time when sports gambling was largely illegal nationwide,\u201d said Josh Whitman, athletics director at Illinois and council chairman. \u201cAs betting on sports has become more widely accepted across the country, Division I members have determined that further discussion of these sports betting rules is warranted, particularly as it relates to the potential distinctions between betting on professional vs. collegiate sports.\u201d",
      "Current NCAA rules do not allow athletes or institutional staff to engage in sports betting for any sports that have NCAA championships; bets by an athlete on their own team or own sport risks a lifetime ban from college athletics.",
      "\u201cThe enforcement staff\u2019s sports betting-related caseload has significantly increased in recent years, and our staff \u2014 including our new sports betting integrity unit \u2014 has been effective in detecting and pursuing violations,\u201d said Jon Duncan, NCAA vice president of enforcement.",
      "Dr. Deena Casiero, the NCAA's chief medical officer, said allowing pro sports betting may be more effective and realistic than an \u201cabstinence-only\u201d approach, clearing the way for education and better understanding of the risks.",
      "\u201cBy meeting student-athletes where they are, schools may be more effective at preventing, identifying and supporting student-athletes with problematic gambling behaviors,\" Casiero said.",
      "In other NCAA moves, the Division I Board of Directors this week formally adopted roster limits for NCAA sports as part of the $2.8 billion House settlement that also allows revenue-sharing and schools to award as many scholarships as they wish within the roster caps.",
      "Also this week, the Division I Council:",
      "\u2014 Endorsed a recommended cap of 32 regular-season games in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball beginning with the 2026-27 season. Critics include early-season tournament organizers who say the change could result in fewer marquee matchups.",
      "\u2014 Introduced a proposal to add women\u2019s flag football to the emerging sports for women program. Flag football has grown rapidly in popularity and will make its Olympic debut at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014 Adopted scheduling flexibility changes allowing Football Championship Subdivision programs to compete in 12 regular-season games every year, starting in 2026.",
      "\u2014 Voted to introduce proposals that, if also supported by Divisions II and III, would establish NCAA championships for women\u2019s stunt and women\u2019s acrobatics and tumbling as early as spring 2027. The sports have grown in popularity.",
      "\u2014 Voted to separate the scoring at the fencing championships to recognize winning teams in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s fencing. Currently, women\u2019s-only teams are statistically unable to win the national championship under the existing scoring format. The change also needs backing by Divisions II and III.",

      "BRIDGETOWN, Barbados -- Travis Head was leading another Australia attempt to be competitive against the West Indies on Thursday in a first test that may not go beyond three days at Kensington Oval.",
      "West Indies claimed a 10-run first-innings lead when it was bowled for 190. Australia then rallied from 65-4 to 92-4 by stumps on day two. Australia led by 82 runs with all the pressure seemingly on Head to survive.",
      "He counterpunched in the first innings with the only half-century of the test so far but bunkered down in the second innings to defy another brilliant effort by the West Indies quicks.",
      "For his stubbornness, Head copped a blow on his left glove from Alzarri Joseph in the day's second-to-last over. Head was 13 not out off 37 balls with support from Beau Webster, 19 not out off 24.",
      "After 14 wickets tumbled on day one, 10 were claimed on day two on a pitch still offering seam and movement for the speedsters.",
      "West Indies picked up its first innings on 57-4 and debutant Brandon King, 23 overnight, was dropped on 26 by wicketkeeper Alex Carey off Josh Hazlewood. But Hazlewood nailed King on the same score when the batter shouldered arms and was castled.",
      "Shai Hope, West Indies' white-ball captain, joined test captain Roston Chase in the middle and they hit back.",
      "Hope drove Mitchell Starc for consecutive fours and Chase knocked Nathan Lyon for a six over mid-off. The pair added 63 runs in 19 overs to get West Indies to lunch on 135-5.",
      "Chase was out after lunch in the first of two disputed decisions by TV umpire Adrian Holdstock.",
      "Chase was given out lbw to Australia captain Pat Cummins but Chase reviewed, suspecting an inside edge before the ball thumped his back pad in front of middle stump. The ball spike technology, UltraEdge, showed some minor spikes before the ball hit the pads but the TV umpire set them aside and said there was a clear gap between bat and ball.",
      "Chase made 44 off 108 balls, including only one boundary and one six, after a 67-run stand with Hope.",
      "Webster got Justin Greaves on 4 and Hope on 48, both from edges behind to Carey, and Hope's was debatable.",
      "Carey took a great one-handed catch but video showed the ball in his glove touching the ground. However, the TV umpire said it was a fair catch. Hope didn't stick around to debate it.",
      "His 91-ball knock left West Indies 162-8, 18 runs short of Australia's first total.",
      "Lusty hitting by Shamar Joseph and Alzarri Joseph, an unbeaten 23 runs off 20 balls, swept the hosts to a 10-run lead.",
      "Australia started its second bat straight after tea and Sam Konstas was dropped twice in the same second over of the innings by Greaves and John Campbell behind the stumps.",
      "The bowler was pacer Shamar Joseph, who has been the victim of five drops in the test, 11 drops in nine tests since his debut in January 2024.",

      "Just before then, Josh Inglis shouldered arms to Seales and was bowled for 12.",
      "Australia was 65-4 after another top order failure but Head and Webster dug in and endured the last eight overs.",

      "\u201cCassie hits it further than me, and I\u2019m nice and down the middle usually,\u201d Dryburgh said. \u201cWe kind of picked the right holes for each other, and I think we gelled really well. We complemented each other really nicely.\u201d",

      "Maguire and Kupcho had an early bogey and then played bogey-free with four birdies over the final 16 holes to join the large group at 67.",
      "For an alternate-shot format that can be stressful, Maguire and Kupcho kept it simple. Both are rarely out of position and consistently good putters.",
      "\u201cWe don't get too aggressive on attacking pins,\u201d Kupcho said. \u201cSo we give ourselves lots of putts and kind of have our speed under control and kind of just make it easy on each other.\u201d",
      "Kupcho teamed with Lizette Salas to win the 2022 event.",
      "The format switches to fourballs on Friday, which yields lower taking the lowest score of each player.",

      "Padraig Harrington made four birdies, though it was the bogey he saved after losing a tee shot deep in a thicket of trees on the 15th hole that helped him keep a share of the first-round lead with Mark Hensby at the U.S. Senior Open",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- Padraig Harrington said he thought it was one part nice, another part disappointing, to scrounge out a bogey after snapping a tee shot deep into the woods on the 15th hole of his opening round at the U.S. Senior Open.",
      "Either way, that scramble Thursday kept Harrington atop the leaderboard, tied with Mark Hensby at 3-under 67 at the Broadmoor, where every shot is an adventure.",
      "\"You never feel good after you\u2019ve lost a ball, so your head is a little scrambled,\u201d said Harrington, the 2022 champion. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to get your head around what you\u2019re doing.\u201c",
      "It's a common feeling on this course at an altitude of 6,000 feet nestled at the base of Cheyenne Mountain \u2014 a tilting landscape that impacts every putt in ways not every player can see.",
      "Stewart Cink hit his first 17 greens on a calm opening day, but finished with a bogey on No. 18 after his first miss. He was part of a group of seven, including Thomas Bjorn, at 68.",

      "Harrington made all four of his birdies on the (easier) front nine and was leading by one when he snapped his tee shot on the par-4 15th. The Irishman said his disappointment came from the fact that he thought his group conducted its 3-minute search in a thicket of trees that was well short of where the ball landed.",
      "His relief came from scraping out a bogey after heading back to the tee box and hitting that shot in deep rough on the right, then the approach from there to 20 feet.",
      "\u201cIn general, you\u2019re just keeping yourself in position, which I did nicely today,\u201d Harrington said.",

      "\u201cObviously, I felt like I lost some out there,\u201d Hensby said. \u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating. I played like (expletive) the back nine. What else can you say?\u201d",
      "He made seven birdies on the front nine to get to 6 under \u2014 a number that might not be approached again at a course that yielded only 17 rounds under par with 156 players in the field.",
      "When the tournament was last played here in 2018, David Toms won with a score of 3-under par \u2014 a number that made Hensby\u2019s score after nine that much more remarkable, whether he was happy with it or not.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never been a very consistent player,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hot or cold, and that kind of sucks.\"",
      "Harrington was one of many players whose practice was shortened Tuesday by a massive thunderstorm that soaked and softened the course.",
      "\u201cWe got a break today, to be fair,\u201d said Notah Begay, who made the field as an alternate and shot even par.",
      "Even with that break, the Day 1 scoring average was 73.94, only about .7 shots under the four-day total from 2018, when only seven players finished under par.",
      "Among those struggling was Angel Cabrera, a two-time senior major winner this year, who shot 73.",
      "Cabrera's 10-foot birdie try on No. 6 skirted the cup, and he dropped his putter and bent down an placed his hands on his knees, trying to figure out how he missed. A hole later, more pain when a 3-footer barely caught the left edge and rimmed out.",
      "The forecast for the next three days calls for highs near 90 and a chance of rain. The altitude and that mountain to the west of the course \u2014 that never changes.",
      "\u201cNot only is it hard to hit the ball at the right distance with the altitude and the ups and downs and the spins and all that,\u201d Cink said. \u201cBut you leave yourself a lot of 20-, 25-foot putts that have a lot of break and don\u2019t always do what they look like they\u2019re going to do.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",

      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",

The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- India, Poland and Hungary launched their first astronauts in more than 40 years Wednesday, sending them on a private flight to the International Space Station.",
      "The three countries shared the tab for the two-week mission. Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the deal, put the ticket price at more than $65 million per customer.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket blasted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center two weeks late because of space station leak concerns. The capsule on top carried not only the three newcomers to space \u2014 none of whom were alive when their countries\u2019 first astronauts launched \u2014 but America\u2019s most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson.",
      "Besides Whitson, the crew includes India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla, a pilot in the Indian Air Force; Hungary\u2019s Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer; and Poland\u2019s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, a radiation expert and one of the European Space Agency\u2019s project astronauts sometimes pressed into temporary duty.",
      "The astronauts are due to arrive at the orbiting lab the next morning.",
      "In addition to dozens of experiments, the astronauts are flying food that celebrates their heritage: Indian curry and rice with mango nectar; spicy Hungarian paprika paste; and freeze-fried Polish pierogies.",
      "Hungary\u2019s first astronaut, Bertalan Farkas, cheered on Kapu from the launch site.",
      "\u201cFor such a small country as Hungary, it is really important to collaborate in a peaceful international space cooperation,\u201d Farkas told The Associated Press. He called it \u201cone of the most important moments\" of his life.",
      "Farkas launched with the Soviets in 1980, taking along a teddy bear in a cosmonaut suit that went back up with Kapu. India and Poland\u2019s original astronauts also launched with the Soviets in the late 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Uznanski-Wisniewski carried up the Polish flag worn on his predecessor\u2019s spacesuit, noting that Miroslaw Hermaszewski was his biggest supporter until his death in 2022. India\u2019s first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, couldn\u2019t make it to Florida for the launch; Shukla said he\u2019s been a mentor \u201cat every step of this journey\u201d and is flying a surprise gift for him.",
      "While others born in India and Hungary have flown in space before \u2014 including NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, who died aboard the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and two-time space tourist Charles Simonyi, of Microsoft fame \u2014 they were U.S. citizens at the time of launch.",
      "Shukla said before the flight that he hopes \u201cto ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country\u201d and drive innovation. Like his crewmates, he plans several outreach events with those back home.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that even though I, as an individual, am traveling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth chartered flight to the space station since 2022 and Whitson\u2019s second time flying as an Axiom crew commander and chaperone. The trip caused her to miss her induction into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame late last month, since she was in quarantine before the flight. Whitson joined Axiom after retiring from NASA nearly a decade ago and has logged almost two years in orbit over her career.",
      "Once opposed to nontraditional station guests, NASA now throws out the welcome mat, charging for their food and upkeep while insisting that an experienced astronaut accompany them.",
      "It\u2019s all part of NASA\u2019s push to open space \u2014 moon included \u2014 to private businesses. Axiom is among several U.S. companies planning to launch their own space stations in the next few years. The goal is for them to be up and running before the international station comes down in 2031 after more than three decades of operation.",
      "Access to space \u201cis not only for the biggest agencies anymore \u2014 space is for everyone,\u201d Poland\u2019s Uznanski-Wisniewski said ahead of liftoff. He repeated the sentiment upon reaching orbit.",
      "Hungarians want to \u201csit at the same table with the giants,\u201d said Kapu. Through this mission, \u201cHungary gets one step closer to the stars.\u201d",
      "They should have flown earlier this year, but their mission was delayed following a switch in SpaceX capsules. The change enabled NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to return to Earth in March sooner than planned.",
      "The Axiom astronauts faced more launch delays once arriving in Florida. SpaceX had to fix an oxygen leak in its rocket, then NASA put the crew\u2019s visit on indefinite hold while monitoring repairs to longtime air leaks on the Russian side of the space station.",
      "Once in orbit, the astronauts radioed messages in their native languages and revealed the name they gave to their brand-new capsule: Grace.",
      "\u201cGood things come to those who wait,\" SpaceX told the crew. \"Godspeed to the maiden crew of Grace.\u201d",
      "SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk\u2019s Falcon rockets launching from Florida and California are considerably smaller than the Starships making test flights out of Texas and, this year, exploding one after the other.

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran will \u201ccertainly\u201d hurt Russia long-term, Albright said.",

      "But that could change if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses or if independent hacking groups supporting Iran make good on promises to wage their own digital conflict against the U.S., analysts and cyber experts say.",

      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",

      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",

      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "But the company is still on the hook and must now go to trial over how it acquired those books by downloading them from online \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated copies.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "But while dismissing a key claim made by the group of authors who sued the company for copyright infringement last year, Alsup also said Anthropic must still go to trial in December over its alleged theft of their works.",
      "\u201cAnthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "A trio of writers \u2014 Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 alleged in their lawsuit last summer that Anthropic's practices amounted to \u201clarge-scale theft,\" and that the San Francisco-based company \u201cseeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\u201d",
      "Books are known to be important sources of the data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build large language models. In the race to outdo each other in developing the most advanced AI chatbots, a number of tech companies have turned to online repositories of stolen books that they can get for free.",
      "Documents disclosed in San Francisco's federal court showed Anthropic employees' internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. But that didn't undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",
      "\u201cThat Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "The ruling could set a precedent for similar lawsuits that have piled up against Anthropic competitor OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, as well as against Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Anthropic \u2014 founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021 \u2014 has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way.",
      "But the lawsuit filed last year alleged that Anthropic\u2019s actions \u201chave made a mockery of its lofty goals\u201d by building its AI product on pirated writings.",
      "Anthropic said Tuesday it was pleased that the judge recognized that AI training was transformative and consistent with \u201ccopyright\u2019s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.\u201d Its statement didn't address the piracy claims.",
      "The authors' attorneys declined comment.",

      "LONDON -- Google could be forced to let British users choose whether to use rival search services, the country's antitrust watchdog said Tuesday as it proposed using new digital regulations to boost competition.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said its \u201cpriority measures\u201d include requiring Google to present users with \u201cchoice screens\u201d when they use key products like the Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.",
      "The choice screens would let users \u201ceasily select and switch between search services,\" which could potentially include AI assistants, it said.",
      "The watchdog is seeking to give Google a \u201c strategic market status \u201d label under the new U.K. digital rules. That would give it the power to use \u201ctargeted measures\u201d to impose changes to \u201cspecific aspects\u201d of its search operations in the U.K.",
      "The CMA's move \u201ccould have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK,\u201d Google said.",

      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

      "A laser navigating tool doomed a Japanese company's lunar lander earlier this month, causing it to crash into the moon.",
      "Officials for ispace announced the news from Tokyo on Tuesday. The crash landing was the second for ispace in two years.",
      "This time, the company\u2019s lander named Resilience was aiming for the moon\u2019s far north in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold. NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed pictures of the crash site last week where Resilience and its mini rover ended up as wreckage.",
      "Company officials blamed the accident on the lander's laser range finder, saying it was slow to kick in and properly measure the spacecraft's distance to the lunar surface. Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada stressed that his company \u201chas not stepped down in the face of setbacks\" and is looking to regain customers' trust. Outside experts will join the accident review, and ispace will collaborate more closely with the Japanese Space Agency on technical matters.",

      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump took a victory a lap on Friday after the Supreme Court limited nationwide injunctions issued by lower court judges against his executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship.",
      "\"This was a big one, wasn't it?\" Trump said as he walked into the White House briefing room.",
      "While Trump celebrated the 6-3 court decision as a \"monumental win,\" the justices did not weigh in on whether his executive order is constitutional and allowed legal challenges to continue.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledged the justices will rule on the merits of Trump's Day 1 order during their next term, which starts in October.",
      "Trump and Bondi, though, praised the court's conservative majority for limiting a federal judge's power to block a president's policy nationwide. Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued only the Supreme Court can provide such universal relief.",
      "Nationwide injunctions have been at the center of the administration's monthslong standoff with the judiciary, as several of Trump's actions -- from his immigration crackdown to efforts to freeze federal funding -- have been halted by district court judges.",
      "\"I was elected on a historic mandate,\" Trump said from the podium. \"In recent months we've seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they've voted for in record numbers. It was a grave threat to democracy.\"",
      "Trump specifically thanked Justice Barrett, who authored the opinion. Barrett has drawn some ire from conservatives for staking out independent ground and at times breaking with Trump, who appointed her to the bench.",
      "Asked about the conservative criticism of Barrett, Trump responded: \"I don't know about that. I just have great respect for her. I always have. And her decision was brilliantly written today.\"",
      "Trump also continued to make the case for his Day 1 executive order that would deny citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to unlawful immigrants or those on a temporary immigrant status. District court judges, so far, have said such a move would appear plainly contrary to the text of the 14th Amendment and legal precedent.",
      "The administration's claimed in court proceedings birthright citizenship creates a strong incentive for illegal immigration.",
      "\"They used birthright citizenship, some of the worst people, some of the cartels, to get people into our country,\" Trump said on Friday.",
      "Several Democrats, however, quickly spoke out against the court's ruling.",
      "Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called it a \"green light\" for Trump to \"unravel the foundations of American democracy.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to limit courts of their long-held authority to block illegal executive actions is an unprecedented and terrifying step toward authoritarianism, a grave danger to our democracy, and a predictable move from this extremist MAGA court,\" he wrote on X. \"By weakening the power of district courts to check the presidency, the Court is not defending the Constitution -- it\u2019s defacing it.\"",
      "\"His plan to end birthright citizenship is blatantly unconstitutional, but instead of stopping it in its tracks, the Court has instead ducked the question and bowed to an out-of-control Executive Branch,\" Schumer added.",

      "In a series of final rulings ahead of Bryan Kohberger's capital murder trial, Judge Steven Hippler said lawyers for the man who could be executed, if convicted, won't be permitted to present to the jury the theory that some unknown person is the real killer.",
      "The trial in the Idaho college killings case will begin Aug. 18, a week later than originally planned, a judge ruled Thursday.",
      "With jury selection starting on Aug. 4, a series of final rulings has cleared the path for the trial of Bryan Kohberger as Judge Steven Hippler said lawyers for the man who could be executed, if convicted, won't be permitted to present to the jury the theory that some unknown person is the real killer.",
      "However, Kohberger\u2019s defense will be allowed to press investigators on whether they followed up on all plausible leads enough, beyond simply pursuing Kohberger, the judge said.",
      "\"Nothing links these individuals to the homicides or otherwise gives rise to a reasonable inference that they committed the crime; indeed, it would take nothing short of rank speculation by the jury to make such a finding,\" the judge said.",
      "Kohberger's lawyers had offered the judge, under seal, what they said were four other people who might have killed Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin in an off-campus house on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys -- who insist he is innocent -- did acknowledge that they didn't have enough to pursue that strategy at the trial's outset and wanted the judge to give them \"latitude\" in building that theory when they cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses.",
      "The judge rejected the proof they offered as paper-thin at best, and \"entirely irrelevant.\"",
      "\"At best, [Kohberger's] offer of proof can give rise to only wild speculation that it is possible any one of these four individuals could have committed the crimes,\" Judge Steven Hippler said, adding the defense can't \"merely offer up unsupported speculation that another person may have committed the crime, which is all [Kohberger] has done here.\"",
      "In his ruling, Hippler said allowing the defense to indulge that theory would risk leading the jury \"astray\" and waste their \"precious time,\" the judge said.",
      "Kohberger's defense previously suggested there could be someone else behind the killings, pointing to the other unidentified male DNA samples found in the crime scene area. But, the judge noted, each of the four people proffered as alternates had cooperated with authorities, provided their DNA and fingerprints and that forensics had already excluded their DNA from the samples taken from the crime scene and victims.",
      "The fourth individual offered as an alternate had a \"passing connection\" to one of the victims, the judge said: he \"noticed her shopping at a store approximately five weeks prior to the homicides.\"",
      "\"He followed her briefly out the exit of the store while considering approaching her to talk. He turned away before ever speaking to her,\" the judge said.",
      "Hippler added that the event was \"captured on a surveillance camera,\" and that this man had cooperated with authorities. His DNA had already been excluded from those taken from the crime scene.",
      "In another new filing just posted to the docket, Judge Hippler also denied the defense's attempt to further delay the trial.",
      "Kohberger \"has not made a showing that there is good cause to continue the trial,\" Hippler said.",
      "Kohberger's lawyers had pushed for another delay, citing a massive trove of records turned over by the prosecution in such a high-stakes case, the \"inflammatory\" media coverage potentially biasing the jury, and because they needed more time to prepare their case for sentencing, should he be convicted.",
      "The judge itemized the extensive investigation that Kohberger's lawyers had already done to prepare for a possible sentencing phase that show an \"expansive understanding\" of who the man is and the world he's been living in.",
      "The list includes his educational, medical and mental health records; his father's military records; \"multiple\" interviews with Kohberger himself as well as family members, two of his fourth-grade teachers, his former boxing coach, and a psychologist who evaluated Kohberger in 2005; interviews with his former Masters' degree professor/advisor; and letters and jail calls between Kohberger and his family.",
      "There is also a lengthy redacted section discussing \"speculation\" Kohberger's lawyers want to \"chase down,\" which the judge calls \"unsupported suspicions\" that \"smacks of tactical gamesmanship and delay.\"",
      "If they were \"truly struggling\" to be ready for an August trial, they should have said so sooner, before all the deadlines had passed, the judge said. Kohberger's lawyers have \"robustly litigated\" this case so far, amassed dozens of experts and other team members and filed numerous briefs.",
      "The judge also said he doubted the national media attention on the case would decrease with a delay.",
      "\"Four college students in a small Idaho college town were brutally stabbed to death by an unknown perpetrator,\" the judge said. \"It was an immediate media sensation and garnered widespread attention that not only continues to persist, but continues to grow.\"",

    "summary": "The decision is a major setback for Republicans who are under time pressure.",
    "story": [
      "Thune has said he was opposed to going against the Senate's rule enforcer.",
      "Many Republican senators dismissed the idea of overruling the Senate parliamentarian after she rejected key Medicaid provisions in Trump's tax and immigration bill Thursday, which dealt a blow to Republicans' plan to slash costs in the budget package.",
      "This sentiment comes as Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said for months that he was opposed to going against the Senate's rule enforcer.",
      "Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough on Thursday denied the GOP plan to cap states' ability to collect more federal Medicaid funding through health care provider taxes -- a controversial provision that would have funded much of the bill's tax cuts. Most of the savings in the bill came from the changes in Medicaid.",
      "MacDonough's ruling means that Senate Republicans will need to retool the provision or scrap it entirely if they want to move forward with attempting to pass the bill using only GOP votes.",
      "The ruling is a major setback for Republican leadership, who are under pressure to expeditiously move it to the Senate floor to meet Trump's Fourth of July deadline for passage. This ruling will require potentially major reworks of the bill with relatively little time to accomplish them. And no matter how they change it, leaders are likely to frustrate some faction of the Republican conference, which could imperil the bill's passage.",
      "Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson said the House is \"on a wait and see basis\" as the Senate continues to make changes to the bill.",
      "The speaker said the Senate Medicaid ruling \u201cdoesn\u2019t make it easier\u201d for the bill to pass by the July 4 deadline.",
      "\u201cBut you know me, hope springs eternal. And we are going to work around the clock to try and meet that deadline.\u201d",
      "Johnson suggested he could \u201cmake a case\u201d for overruling the parliamentarian.",
      "\u201cIf only that were our decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe senators have to make that call. I mean, I can make a case for it, but no one's asking.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday afternoon when procedural votes on the bill might begin, Thune looked over his shoulder and said, \"We'll get back to you on that.\"",
      "A number of Senate Republicans said on Thursday morning that they'd work to tweak language in the bill and send it back to MacDonough for review -- but would not overrule her. It's also unlikely that the Senate would move forward with the bill without the provider tax provisions, some said.",
      "The Senate has \"no intention of overruling her,\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said of MacDonough. \"But I think we'll take another shot.\"",
      "Other Republican senators said that this will delay the timeline for passing the bill, which was set to move through the chamber this weekend.",
      "\"I think we'll make another run at it \u2026 my guess is that they'll continue to work,\" Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt said.",
      "\"Yeah, could push [the timeline] back,\" Schmitt said about MacDonough's ruling. \"We'll see. But we're committed to being here through the weekend, so I don't think it changes that overall time frame.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Rick Scott said MacDonough's ruling is \"pretty frustrating,\" but rejected the idea that the Senate would overrule the parliamentarian.",
      "\"What we've got to do is work through this process and come up with something that fulfills the Trump agenda -- also has fiscal sanity. So I'm going to keep working hard to do that,\" Scott said, adding he's \"optimistic\" it can be accomplished.",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy stated clearly that \"we would never overrule the parliamentarian.\"",
      "Other Republicans fumed over the parliamentarian and her ruling.",
      "Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville came out brashly against MacDonough -- calling for Thune to fire her \"ASAP\" and accused her of being partisan. He did not mention overruling her, however.",
      "\"The WOKE Senate Parliamentarian, who was appointed by Harry Reid and advised Al Gore, just STRUCK DOWN a provision BANNING illegals from stealing Medicaid from American citizens. This is a perfect example of why Americans hate THE SWAMP,\" Tuberville said in a post on X.",
      "\"Unelected bureaucrats think they know better than U.S. Congressmen who are elected BY THE PEOPLE. Her job is not to push a woke agenda. THE SENATE PARLIAMENTARIAN SHOULD BE FIRED ASAP,\" he added.",
      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin suggested that MacDonough made her rulings as part of a \"political decision.\"",
      "\"I'm concerned about the parliamentarian's ability to make these decisions,\" Mullin said.",
      "He later added, \"If it's a political decision on [her] part, then that's not OK.\"",
      "The provider tax credit provisions had been emerging as a thorn in leadership's side even before MacDonough's ruling.",
      "For days, a small but critical faction of the Senate GOP conference had been raising major flags about the way this cut to states' Medicaid revenue might kneecap rural hospitals in their states. A number of Republicans in the Senate were threatening to withhold their votes for the package because of these changes to the provider tax, so for that group, MacDonough's ruling is likely a welcome one.",
      "If changes are made to the provision, all eyes will be on a handful of Senate Republicans. Some changes could be deal breakers for those whose vote is critical to moving the bill over the finish line.",
      "Last weekend, MacDonough carefully scrutinized the House-passed bill for possible violations of the Senate's rules. She has already issued a number of decisions that Democrats are touting as major victories.",
      "This review, called the Byrd Bath -- named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd, who helped institute the rules governing budget reconciliation packages, is still underway in the Senate.",
      "Any provision that MacDonough rules out of order with the Senate's rules will have to be stripped or else the legislation will be subject to the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Republicans need to avoid this, or they won't be able to pass the bill.",

      "Officials unveiled details about a 15-year top-secret program.",
      "The Pentagon on Thursday released an extraordinary number of details about the military's top-secret bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities and its defense of an air base in Qatar.",
      "The unusual disclosures \u2013 including analysts briefed at secret locations, bombs dropped into ventilation shafts, and a small group of young service members left behind at a base to shoot down Iranian missiles \u2013 is being orchestrated by a White House angry over questions about the effectiveness of the U.S. strike, which targeted three Iranian nuclear targets on June 21.",
      "Trump insists Iran's nuclear program has been \"obliterated,\" while an early military intelligence assessment said the strike might only have set back Iran's program by \"months.\" Military officials say they need much more time to assess the damage.",
      "Here's what we've learned:",
      "There was a 15-year, top-secret mission to figure out how to destroy Iran's Fordo nuclear facility",
      "In 2009, a U.S. officer working for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency was brought into a vault at an undisclosed location and shown highly classified photos of a construction site in the Iranian mountains, according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Caine said the officer and another colleague would go on to spend 15 years studying the site. They analyzed the weather and the geology of the mountain, along with any items discarded from the site. They eyed ventilation shafts, electrical systems and environmental control systems too, he said.",
      "\"Every nook, every crater, every piece of equipment going in and every piece of equipment going out -- they literally dreamed about this target at night when they slept,\" Caine said.",
      "When the analysts realized they did not have a weapon to strike Fordo if needed, Caine said they teamed up with industry in a top-secret effort to build the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or GBU-57, specifically to hit it.",
      "\"Then, on a day in June of 2025, more than 15 years after they started their life's work, the phone rang and the president of the United States ordered the B-2 force\" to strike the target, Caine said.",
      "One of them later told Caine, \"I can't even get my head around this.\"",
      "12 bombs were dropped down two ventilation shafts capped with concrete",
      "In a bid to defend the strikes as successful, both Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in recent days have publicly disclosed that 12 of the 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators used in the June 21 strike were dropped on the nuclear facility at Fordo.",
      "At the briefing on Thursday, Caine went further, describing that six bunker-buster bombs were dropped down each of the two ventilation shafts with fuses programmed to detonate at specific times.",
      "Caine said the Iranians had covered the ventilation shafts with concrete caps, but the first bomb blew off the caps. After that, the next four bombs were programmed to drop more than 1,000 feet per second and \"explode in the mission space.\" The final bomb was designated as a \"flex weapon,\" or backup, he said.",
      "\"All six weapons at each vent, at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go,\" Caine said, adding that the result was \"a mix of overpressure and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware.\"",
      "Caine said the fighter pilots who trailed the B-2 bombers said that after the first bomb struck the target \"the pilots stated, quote, this was the brightest explosion that I've ever seen. It literally looked like daylight.\"",
      "DIA says Fordo damaged, but questions remain on impact to Iran's nuclear program",
      "About a day after the attack, the Defense Intelligence Agency produced an early assessment estimating Iran's nuclear program was set back by \"months.\"",
      "According to the two people familiar with the classified report, the bombing sealed off the entrances to two of the three nuclear sites targeted in the attack but that most of the damage was done to structures above ground, leaving the lower structures intact. The assessment also found that at least some enriched uranium remained \u2013 possibly moved from the nuclear sites ahead of the blasts.",
      "President Donald Trump insists the enriched uranium wasn't moved in advance.",
      "Hegseth, visibly angry that details of the report had leaked, said \"new intelligence\" estimates the Iran program has been knocked back by \"years,\" not months, and he read from the classified assessment to reporters.",
      "\"It points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all,\" said Hegseth, adding that the report was labeled \"low confidence.\"",
      "A couple of dozen service members in their 20s defended a U.S. airbase in Qatar.",
      "Two days after the strike, U.S. officials got word that Iran was planning to launch a retaliatory attack on an American air base in Qatar called al-Udeid.",
      "According to Caine, officials quickly evacuated the base in part of extend the security perimeter, leaving behind two Patriot missile batteries and some 44 soldiers.",
      "Of the troops left to defend the base, the oldest was a 28-year-old captain.",
      "Caine said the group listened to \"chatter\" of the impending attack in the oppressive heat and were told to ensure their missile batteries were pointed north. Iran began launching short- and medium-range missiles, prompting the soldiers to unleash \"round after round\" of Patriot missiles from their canisters.",
      "Caine called the operation the \"largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history,\" noting the Qataris aided in the defense.",
      "\"I'm not going to tell you how many rounds were shot,\" Caine said, noting the number was classified. \"But it was a bunch.\"",

      "Trump remains adamant about the July Fourth \"big, beautiful bill\" deadline.",
      "Despite a setback to President Donald Trump's megabill Thursday morning, the president held an event in the East Room of the White House to rally Republicans behind his tax legislation.",
      "\u201cWe're cutting $1.7 trillion in this bill, and you're not going to feel any of it. And your Medicaid is left alone. It's left the same. Your Medicare and your Social Security are strengthened,\u201d Trump said during his remarks, arguing that the Democrats will be \u201ccutting your Medicare, Medicaid in half.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost every major promise made in the 2024 campaign already will have become a promise kept. That's very important,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cSo we're going to do a real job, so important. So if you can call your senators, call your congressmen, we have to get the vote,\u201d he urged.",
      "One notable moment came when Trump said he signed a trade deal with China on Wednesday, though he provided no details on the deal. Asked to clarify Trump\u2019s comments, a White House official told ABC News that the administration and China agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the agreement they made in Geneva in May.",
      "The president also teased a trade deal in the works with India.",
      "\"We have one coming up, maybe with India. Very big one,\" he said. \"Well, we're going to open up India. In the China deal, we're starting to open up China, things that never really could have happened. And the relationship with every country has been very good,\u201d he added.",
      "The event came hours after the Senate parliamentarian rejected key Medicaid provisions in the bill -- a major blow to Senate Republicans and their plan to slash costs in the budget package.",
      "Among the special guests at the event were delivery drivers, a barber from Arkansas, law enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Earlier Thursday during a press briefing, Leavitt said the purpose of the event was to \"show the American people how this bill works for them and how there are provisions in this bill that will change their lives.\"",
      "Negotiations are underway in the Senate on the House-passed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" with some fiscal hawks pushing for additional changes.",
      "When asked if there is enough time for Congress to work through the issues that come up with the parliamentarian's ruling, the White House remained adamant that the president expects to sign it next week on Independence Day.",
      "\"We expect that bill to be on the president's desk for signature by July Fourth. I know that there was a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian this morning. Look, this is part of the process. This is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate. But the president is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day,\" she said.",
      "\"We hope so,\" Trump said as he left the event when asked if Congress can get the bill passed by his July Fourth deadline.",
      "Frustrated Republican senators balked at the parliamentarian's ruling -- with some seeking to rework the language in order to get it passed.",
      "When asked what the president is doing to push his legislation across the finish line, Leavitt indicated that he's hosting meetings at the White House.",

      "The 6-3 decision broke along ideological lines.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday said individual Medicaid recipients do not have a right to sue over their state's decision to cut off Planned Parenthood from the government-funded health insurance program for low-income residents.",
      "The 6-3 decision, which broke along ideological lines, was a significant victory for conservative efforts to defund the private health clinic network, clearing the way for other states to follow suit.",
      "\"The Supreme Court rightly restored the ability of states like South Carolina to steward limited public resources to best serve their citizens,\" said John Bursch, the attorney who defended South Carolina before the high court.",
      "Planned Parenthood draws more than a third of its revenue from government grants, contracts and Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion care, like cancer screenings and contraception treatments.",
      "\"Today's decision is a grave injustice that strikes at the very bedrock of American freedom and promises to send South Carolina deeper into a health care crisis,\" Planned Parenthood South Atlantic president Paige Johnson said in a statement.",
      "The organization, which said it has served more than 50,000 state Medicaid beneficiaries so far this year, vowed to continue operations at its two South Carolina clinics.",
      "At issue in the case was whether the Medicaid Act -- which guarantees a \"free choice of provider\" that is willing and qualified --- allows beneficiaries to sue their state if the government infringes on the ability see a preferred provider.",
      "In 2018, South Carolina's Republican Gov. Henry McMaster issued executive orders disqualifying Planned Parenthood from participation in the state's Medicaid program, which is a jointly funded federal-state initiative.",
      "Julie Edwards, a Medicaid beneficiary and type-1 diabetic who sought medical care at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, South Carolina, sued the state alleging a violation of the law.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the court's majority, said that Congress never intended to allow individual recipients to sue states to enforce terms of the Medicaid Act and that it retains the sole responsibility through power of the purse.",
      "\"It generally belongs to the federal government to supervise compliance with its own spending programs,\" Gorsuch wrote.",
      "In dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said that the decision thwarted the will of lawmakers and undermined a key civil rights law.",
      "\"Today's decision is likely to result in tangible harm to real people,\" she wrote. \"At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them. And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians -- and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country -- of a deeply personal freedom: the ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.\"",
      "South Carolina's two Planned Parenthood clinics have served mostly low-income, minority women for more than 40 years.",
      "\"By denying Medicaid enrollees the ability to enforce their right to choose among qualified providers, the Court has effectively closed the courthouse doors to those seeking to protect their access to care,\" said Jane Perkins, legal director at the National Health Law Program, a nonprofit advoacy group. \"This decision disproportionately impacts low-income individuals who rely on Medicaid for essential health services.\"",
      "Anti-abortion groups, which have long targeted Planned Parenthood as the nation's largest provider of abortion services, hailed the Supreme Court decision.",
      "\"Planned Parenthood's taxpayer-funded gravy train is swiftly coming to an end,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America.",

      "Gun control crusader and former U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York has died",
      "Former U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, who successfully ran for Congress in 1996 as a crusader for gun control after a mass shooting on a New York commuter train left her husband dead and her son severely wounded, has died. She was 81.",
      "News of her death was shared Thursday by several elected officials on her native Long Island and by Jay Jacobs, chair of the New York State Democratic Committee. Details about her death were not immediately available.",
      "McCarthy went from political novice to one of the nation\u2019s leading advocates for gun control legislation in the aftermath of the 1993 Long Island Rail Road massacre. However, the suburban New York Democrat found limited success against the National Rifle Association and other Second Amendment advocates.",
      "McCarthy announced in June 2013 that she was undergoing treatment for lung cancer. She announced her retirement in January 2014.",
      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi said the nation has \u201clost a fierce champion.\u201d",
      "\u201cCarolyn channeled her grief and loss into advocacy for change, becoming one of the most dedicated gun violence prevention advocates,\u201d Suozzi said on X.",
      "She became a go-to guest on national TV news shows after each ensuing gun massacre, whether it was at Columbine High School or Sandy Hook Elementary School.",
      "Known as the \u201cgun lady\u201d on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said she couldn\u2019t stop crying after learning that her former colleague, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, had been seriously wounded in a January 2011 shooting in Arizona.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a cancer in our society,\u201d she said of gun violence. \u201cAnd if we keep doing nothing to stop it, it\u2019s only going to spread.\u201d",
      "During one particularly rancorous debate over gun show loopholes in 1999, McCarthy was brought to tears at 1 a.m. on the House floor.",
      "\u201cI am Irish and I am not supposed to cry in front of anyone. But I made a promise a long time ago. I made a promise to my son and to my husband. If there was anything that I could do to prevent one family from going through what I have gone through then I have done my job,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cLet me go home. Let me go home,\u201d she pleaded.",
      "McCarthy was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island. She became a nurse and later married Dennis McCarthy after meeting on a Long Island beach. They had one son, Kevin, during a tumultuous marriage in which they divorced but reconciled and remarried.",
      "McCarthy was a Republican when, on Dec. 7, 1993, a gunman opened fire on a train car leaving New York City. By the time passengers tackled the shooter, six people were dead and 19 wounded.",
      "She jumped into politics after her GOP congressman voted to repeal an assault weapons ban.",
      "Her surprise victory inspired a made-for-television movie produced by Barbra Streisand. Since that first victory in 1996, McCarthy was never seriously challenged for reelection in a heavily Republican district just east of New York City..",
      "Some critics described McCarthy as a one-issue lawmaker, a contention she bristled about, pointing to interests in improving health care and education. But she was realistic about her legacy on gun control, once telling an interviewer:",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve come to peace with the fact that will be in my obituary.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 08:46:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin pushed her fellow Democrats to go back to focusing on the issues and struggles plaguing middle-class Americans in a speech Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "The first-term senator said internal disagreements are splitting the party.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin delivered a blunt assessment of what's wrong with her party on Thursday.",
      "Slotkin expressed frustration with how she said the Democratic Party was \"disparate,\" allowing itself to be split by internal disagreements.",
      "\"We're like a solar system with no sun ... We don't act as a team, and when we don't work as a team, we turn our guns on each other, and it's so, so, so, fruitless,\" she said in a speech at the Center for American Progress.",
      "Asked after her speech by ABC News Live anchor Linsey Davis if she had confidence in Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Slotkin declined to answer.",
      "\"They are the leaders of the House and Senate,\" she said. \"I work with them every single day. I push on them every day, especially in the Senate. I think they would attest to that. And we need to work as a team, and we need wartime generals who are gonna get us there because of what's going on in the country. And I have no big announcement to make. I would just say the pressure is there from inside the caucus, but also from the grassroots.\"",
      "Slotkin characterized the central split within the party as between those who saw the second Trump administration as \"an existential threat to democracy\" and would actively resist, and those who saw it as \"bad, but kind of like the first Trump administration: survivable.\"",
      "\"These labels of progressive, moderate, whatever -- that's less relevant. It's fight or flight,\" Slotkin said. \"I think we are churning behind closed doors to figure out which camp can win.\"",
      "Slotkin pushed her party to focus their priorities on Americans who are struggling the most. A shrinking middle class is the \"single greatest security threat to the U.S.,\" she said.",
      "\"I believe deep in my bones that if we lose our middle class and, by association, the American Dream, we will lose our democracy and eventually our country,\" Slotkin said.",
      "In her speech, meant to present \"A New Vision for the Democratic Party\", Slotkin laid out a plan to focus on affordability and \"pocketbook\" issues. During her speech, she said Democrats needed to \"get back to the basics\", which included creating more and better jobs, affordable options in education, and building more housing.",
      "As the Democratic Party seeks a message that will resonate with voters after its losses in 2024 election, Slotkin emerged as a voice proposing a way forward for the party. Slotkin prevailed over Republican candidate Mike Rogers by 0.34 percentage points last November in a state that President Donald Trump won by more than 1 percentage point.",
      "\"In a multiracial, multiethnic democracy like ours, when people don't feel like they can get ahead, when the system is rigged against them, they start blaming people who don't look like them, or who sound different, or who pray differently. It's how we begin to tear each other apart from the inside,\" Slotkin said. \"So in order to attack that threat, we need to get government back to the basics of what it was designed to do.\"",
      "\"And to me, those fundamentals are the following: jobs that pay enough to save every month; schools that prepare kids for those jobs; a home you can call your own; safety and security from fear; energy to power our lives; and an environment to pass on to our kids; and health care you can actually afford,\" she added.",
      "Slotkin highlighted impacts from artificial intelligence as an area that would require wholesale changes to how the government approaches jobs and education.",
      "\"We need to invest heavily in certification programs, community colleges, trade schools and apprenticeships. Key to that is taking a stick of dynamite to our federal workforce training programs. Just blow it up,\" Slotkin said. \"We have to align all those programs around one goal: training and retraining people for a future economy.\"",
      "Another area Slotkin addressed was housing costs and the need to build more homes. She said the country needed 4 million homes to catch up with what she called a \"housing emergency.\"",
      "\"The single biggest thing holding us back is overlapping and outdated housing regulations \u2026 We need to streamline regulations that hold back builders from constructing homes, federal and state programs, but also incentives for communities to change zoning laws that prevent corruption,\" Slotkin said.",
      "Speaking on health care costs, she argued special interest campaign donations and lobbying were key factors preventing politicians from lowering prices.",
      "\"We have to go after special interests that keep our health care prices high,\" Slotkin said. She added that the perception that special interests were influencing politicians' decisions contributed to some voters believing \"the system is flawed\" as a whole. \"I think that you have to have a radical package of ethics and money reform in order to even start to right that ship.\"",
      "Asked what she took from New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's presumptive win in the New York Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday, where the progressive candidate obtained more first-choice votes than former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Slotkin said voters' prioritization of cost of living was clear.",
      "While Mamdani ran a campaign with a similar relentless economic focus as Slotkin's \"war plan,\" he unabashedly embraced progressive stances, including city-owned grocery stores.",
      "\"People, just like in November, are still really focused on costs and the economy, and their own kitchen table math, and they're looking for a new generation of leadership,\" Slotkin said. \"It reinforces that you may disagree on some key issues, but understanding that people are concerned about their family budget, that is a unifying thing for a coalition.\"",

      "The demonstration followed other anti-Bezos initiatives last week including a banner draped from the San Giorgio bell tower, one from the lagoon city\u2019s famous Rialto Bridge and posters plastered up around town complaining about the upcoming wedding and the effects of overtourism on Venice.",
      "The \u201cNo Space for Bezos\u201d movement \u2014 a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight \u2014 has united a dozen Venetian organizations including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups.",
      "Activists argue the wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over resident needs.",
      "Greenpeace said it teamed with the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, for Monday\u2019s banner. Greenpeace said it wanted to draw attention to the comparitively low taxes many billionaires pay while allegedly exacerbating the climate crisis with environmentally unsustainable lifestyles.",

      "Over the weekend, as the protests continued to make headlines in Italy, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, said Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but noted contacts began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "A key inflation gauge moved higher in May in the latest sign that prices remain stubbornly elevated while Americans cut back on their spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- A key inflation gauge moved higher in May in the latest sign that prices remain stubbornly elevated while Americans cut back on their spending.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, an increase from 2.5% the previous month. Both figures are modestly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.",
      "At the same time, Americans cut back on spending for the first time since January, as overall spending fell 0.1%.",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Donald Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffsare still having only a modest effect on prices. The costs of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares, and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month\u2019s 0.1%.",
      "The weakness in spending in part likely reflects reduced purchases of cars and other manufactured goods after Americans stepped up their spending on those items this spring to get ahead of tariffs.",

      "President Donald Trump's unconventional approach to clemency has spread hope among federal prisoners and formerly incarcerated people around the United States, prompting a wave of petitions carefully crafted to capture his attention",
      "ASHLAND, Ky. -- Pounding away on a prison typewriter, Chad Scott seemed worlds apart from President Donald Trump.",
      "But when the disgraced narcotics agent wrote the White House seeking clemency for his corruption conviction, Scott sought to draw Trump\u2019s attention to what they have in common.",
      "Both men had survived a bullet wound to the ear, Scott wrote, and had been convicted of falsifying records. They were also each a victim of \u201cpolitical persecution,\u201d the type of catchphrase the former agent hoped would resonate with a man who has long complained of witch hunts.",
      "By helping him, Scott argued, Trump would be showing he had \u201cthe back of law enforcement.\u201d",
      "\u201cChad Scott is a hero in this country\u2019s war on drugs,\u201d his attorney wrote in a clemency petition reviewed by The Associated Press, adding it would be a \u201cgross waste of taxpayer money\u201d to house and feed the former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent for six more years.",
      "Scott\u2019s application is hardly unique, according to prisoners, defense attorneys and officials. The White House and the Justice Department have received a wave of such requests \u2014 all carefully crafted to capture the attention and fancy of Trump or those who know his inclinations.",
      "The flurry, legal experts said, has been sparked by Trump\u2019s frequent and eyebrow-raising grants of clemency since retaking office in January. The Republican president has pardoned and commuted the sentences of more than 1,600 people, including many political allies, former GOP officeholders and hundreds charged or convicted in the 2021 Capitol riot. He even pardoned a pair of reality TV stars who were serving time for bank fraud and tax evasion.",
      "In doing so, Trump has largely cast aside a process that historically has been overseen by nonpolitical personnel at the Justice Department who spent their days poring over clemency applications \u2014 thick packets filled with character references attesting to applicants' atonement and good deeds. Only those meeting strict criteria were then passed along to the White House.",
      "Those procedures appear to have been replaced by the caprice of a president known for his transactional approach to governance, his loyalty to supporters and his disdain for perceived enemies.",
      "It\u2019s created \u201ca free-for-all\u201d for those seeking clemency, said Liz Oyer, the Justice Department\u2019s former pardon attorney, who was fired in March. \u201cThe traditional process and practices,\u201d she told the AP, \u201call seem to have fallen by the wayside.\u201d",
      "That has left an opening for prisoners like Eric Sanchez Chaparro, who is seeking a commutation for a drug and weapons conviction that carries a 19-year prison sentence. The optimism, he said, has never been higher for those behind bars.",
      "\u201cIn many ways I feel like he has the same point of view that we\u2019ve got,\u201d Chaparro said in a telephone interview, noting that both he and the president were convicted of felonies. Trump was convicted last year on New York state charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star but was sentenced to no punishment.",
      "\u201cEven though people try to put him down,\u201d Chaparro added, \u201che kept on pushing for his goal.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration did not disclose how many people have reached out to Trump or White House officials to seek clemency, though some have boasted of doing so in colorful ways. Last week, Joe Exotic, the former zookeeper known as the \u201cTiger King,\u201d posted a song he said he wrote for Trump on social media, claiming he was \u201cpaying the time for a crime I didn\u2019t do.\u201d He\u2019s serving a 21-year sentence for the failed murder-for-hire of an animal-welfare activist.",
      "Since Trump retook office five months ago, his Justice Department has received more than 9,300 petitions seeking commutations of sentences or pardons. At that pace, the tally would blow past the approximately 15,000 petitions filed during the four years of President Joe Biden's Democratic administration. The Justice Department received about 12,000 petitions in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Clemency is perhaps the most unchecked power enjoyed by a president, as actions cannot be undone by courts or other officials. Presidents can commute sentences \u2014 reducing or eliminating them \u2014 or bestow a pardon that wipes away convictions or criminal charges.",
      "Trump is hardly the first president to generate controversy over how he has handled such powers. Biden prompted bipartisan outrage in December when he pardoned his son Hunter, sparing him a possible prison sentence for felony gun and tax convictions. And Biden was sharply criticized \u2014 mainly by Republicans \u2014 for issuing preemptive pardons to protect lawmakers, former officials and his family members from what he described as a potentially vindictive Trump administration.",
      "Even so, legal scholars say, Trump\u2019s approach to clemency has veered into unprecedented territory.",
      "The president, for example, tapped a vociferous political supporter, Ed Martin Jr., to be the Justice Department's pardon attorney. Martin is a former defense lawyer who represented Jan. 6 rioters and promoted false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen by Democrats. Trump gave Martin the post after pulling his nomination to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia in the face of bipartisan concerns over his divisive politics. Martin did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Much of Trump\u2019s mercy has gone to political allies, campaign donors and fraudsters who claimed they were victims of a \u201cweaponized\u201d Justice Department. The pardons that have drawn the most attention include one issued to a tax cheat whose mother raised millions of dollars for Republican causes.",
      "There was the pardon of a prolific straw donor for foreign contributions who gave $900,000 to Trump\u2019s first inaugural committee. Trump voided the conviction of Scott Jenkins, a Virginia sheriff and vocal Trump supporter, sentenced to 10 years for deputizing several businessmen in exchange for cash payments.",
      "\u201cWhat these pardons signal \u2014 together with everything else \u2014 is that all bets are now off,\u201d said Frank Bowman, a legal historian and professor emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law who is writing a book on pardons. \u201cIt\u2019s a grotesque misuse of constitutional authority of a kind that has never been seen in American history.\u201d",
      "Administration officials say Trump decides on clemency requests after they\u2019re vetted by the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, the White House pardon czar and the Justice Department. Reviewers have been focusing on nonviolent, rehabilitated criminals with compelling references, the officials said. The White House is also considering petitions from those serving unjustified sentences and what the administration deems \u201cover-prosecution.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump doesn\u2019t need lectures from Democrats about his use of pardons, especially from those who supported a president who pardoned his corrupt son, shielded Dr. Fauci from accountability for the millions who suffered under his failed COVID leadership and backed the infamous \u2018kids-for-cash\u2019 judge who profited from incarcerating children,\u201d White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email. \u201cPresident Trump is using his pardon and commutation powers to right many wrongs, acting reasonably and responsibly within his constitutional authority.\u201d",
      "All the while, Trump\u2019s approach has spread hope among lesser-connected prisoners who long ago exhausted their appeals, a half dozen federal prisoners told the AP in interviews.",
      "A remedy long likened to winning the lottery seems more attainable in an administration that has dispensed with many of the traditional criteria considered in clemency, including remorse, the severity of the crime and the amount of time a prisoner has already served.",
      "Jonathan E. Woods, an early Trump supporter and former Arkansas state senator, is serving an 18-year sentence for a bribery conviction.",
      "The former legislator believes he has a legitimate shot at winning a commutation because, he wrote to the AP, \u201cPresident Trump is viewed as someone as having a big heart, nonjudgmental and someone who has been put through hell by a very imperfect legal system.\u201d",
      "\u201cInmates view him as someone who will listen to them in hopes of going home early to their loved ones,\u201d Woods added.",
      "Woods, who is serving time in a prison in Texas, has also raised allegations he hopes will resonate with the president: evidence of misconduct by an FBI agent who investigated the former state senator. That agent pleaded guilty to \u201ccorruptly destroying\u201d his government hard drive in Woods\u2019 case.",
      "Trump spent years blasting the FBI, particularly for how it investigated him over allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and its role in the Justice Department's ill-fated prosecutions of Trump in the Capitol riot and his retention of classified documents at his Florida resort.",
      "Less political appeals have also been fruitful \u2014 thanks to the president\u2019s advisers.",
      "Those working to land pardons for Eddie and Joe Sotelo didn\u2019t give up after Biden rejected their application. Instead, advocates turned to help from Alice Marie Johnson, whom Trump recently tapped as his pardon czar after commuting her sentence for federal drug and money laundering charges in 2018.",
      "It was Johnson who intervened on behalf of the brothers, who had been serving life prison terms for a drug-trafficking conspiracy, said Brittany Barnett, founder of the Buried Alive Project, a nonprofit advocacy group that took up the Sotelos\u2019 case. The brothers were freed late last month.",
      "Johnson \u201cknows firsthand the weight of a life sentence,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cThese men were serving the same sentence as the Unabomber \u2014 on drug charges.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s open-mindedness has sent \u201cshock waves of hope through the prison walls for the thousands of people still serving extreme sentences,\u201d Barnett said.",
      "No commutation seems out of the question in prisons like FCI Ashland, the Kentucky lockup where Scott, the former DEA agent, has been held nearly four years.",
      "Scott, 57, was exercising in March with Brian Kelsey, when the former Tennessee state senator received word he had been pardoned just two weeks into a 21-month sentence for campaign finance fraud. Kelsey called his release a \u201cvictory for every American who believes in one impartial justice system for all.\u201d",
      "Last month, the president pardoned another former Ashland prisoner, P.G. Sittenfeld, a former Cincinnati city councilman who not only won office as a Democrat but sharply criticized Trump. It is unclear why Trump pardoned Sittenfeld, who also seemed surprised by the grant of clemency. \u201cI was as stunned as I suspect you were,\u201d he wrote supporters this month, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier.",
      "In his own application for a commutation, Scott sought to draw Trump\u2019s attention not only to his ear wound \u2014 sustained in a shooting that predated his law enforcement career \u2014 but also the prosecutor who handled his case. That prosecutor went on to work for special counsel Jack Smith, whose team twice indicted Trump. The charges were dropped after Trump won the November election.",
      "\u201cThough I do not claim to be a saint, I DID NOT commit the crimes for which I have been convicted,\u201d Scott wrote to the president, even using all caps like Trump does on social media.",
      "Scott had been among the most prolific narcotics agents in the country during his 17-year career at the DEA and won several awards for his work.",
      "His downfall began in 2016, when two members of his New Orleans-based task force were arrested for stealing and using drugs, prompting a yearslong FBI inquiry. A federal jury convicted Scott in 2019 of orchestrating false testimony against a trafficker. He also was found guilty of falsifying DEA paperwork to acquire a pickup truck and, following a separate trial, stealing money and property from suspects.",
      "Scheduled for release in 2031, he has exhausted every possible appeal. Clemency from Trump, Scott told the AP, is his \u201clast resort.\u201d",
      "By all accounts, Scott has been a model prisoner and has been awarded sought-after privileges. He spends his days as FCI Ashland\u2019s \u201ctown driver,\u201d chauffeuring newly released prisoners to bus stops, halfway houses, hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices in nearby cities.",
      "And he has participated in a program called Pawsibilities Unleashed, in which he raises and trains service and therapy dogs behind bars.",
      "He named one of his most recent canines, a Labradane, Trump.",

      "The United Nations peacekeeping chief has warned that the conflict in Sudan is spilling across its southwest border into Central African Republic",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The conflict in Sudan is spilling across its southwestern border into Central African Republic, a country already battered by its own conflict with rebels, the United Nations peacekeeping chief warned Thursday.",
      "Undersecretary-General Jean-Pierre Lacroix told the U.N. Security Council that the attack that killed a U.N. peacekeeper near the country's border with Sudan last Friday was carried out by \u201carmed Sudanese elements.\u201d His comments were the first identifying Sudanese armed fighters as responsible for the attack on the peacekeepers.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in a new report to the Security Council that vehicles suspected of belonging to the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 the key actors in Sudan's civil war \u2014 were sighted on several occasions in the areas of Am Dafok and Aouk (Vakaga Prefecture) of Central African Republic, where U.N. peacekeepers are present.",
      "In the report covering the period from mid-February to mid-June, Guterres said, \u201cIn the northeast (of CAR), armed incursions linked to the conflict in the Sudan continued.\u201d",
      "Sudan plunged into civil war when rival generals heading the country\u2019s armed forces and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces started fighting each other in mid-April 2023. Since then, at least 24,000 people have died, about 13 million Sudanese have fled their homes, famine is setting in and cholera is sweeping across the country. Both sides have been accused of war crimes.",
      "Meanwhile, CAR has been battling conflict since 2013, when predominantly Muslim rebels seized power and forced then President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 from office. It is among the first countries in Africa to welcome Russia-backed forces, with Moscow seeking to help protect authorities and fight armed groups.",
      "Lacroix, the U.N. peacekeeping chief, said that while progress is being made with some groups on reintegrating into CAR's peace process, violence by armed groups and militias continues, compromising stability and posing a significant threat to civilians.",
      "He said the government continues to collaborate with MINUSCA \u2014 the U.N.'s peacekeeping operation in CAR \u2014 on extending and enhancing its presence throughout the country and improving security in border areas.",
      "\u201cDespite these efforts, the security situation remains tenuous in border areas in the northeast,\u201d Lacroix said. \u201cIn the border region with Sudan, instability continues to be characterized by the spillover of the Sudanese conflict.\u201d",
      "With general elections expected to be held in December, the political situation remains \u201cpunctuated by mistrust and tensions between the majority in power and opposition,\u201d Lacroix said. The elections represent a \u201dcrucial opportunity\u201d to strengthen democratic governance, promote reconciliation and consolidate stability, he added.",

      "Former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman will lie in state at the Minnesota Capitol rotunda",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman will lie in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda on Friday while the man charged with killing her and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is due in court.",
      "Hortman, a Democrat, will be the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans accorded the honor. She will lie in state with her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert. Her husband was also killed in the June 14 attack, and Gilbert was seriously wounded and had to be euthanized.",
      "The public can pay their respects from noon to 5 p.m. Friday. House TV will livestream the viewing. A private funeral is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday. The service will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris will fly to Minnesota for the funeral but won\u2019t have a speaking role, according to her personal office. Harris expressed her condolences this past week to Hortman\u2019s adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her 2024 running mate, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.",
      "The man accused of killing the Hortmans and wounding another Democratic lawmaker and his wife is due in court Friday to face charges for what the chief federal prosecutor for Minnesota has called \u201ca political assassination.\u201d Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities have called the largest search in Minnesota history.",
      "The hearing, before Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko, is expected to address whether Boelter should remain in custody without bail and affirm that there is probable cause to proceed. He is not expected to enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment before he's arraigned later, which is when a plea is normally entered.",
      "According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans\u2019 home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers\u2019 homes dressed as a police officer.",
      "His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. The acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. The Death Penalty Information Center says a federal death penalty case hasn't been prosecuted in Minnesota in the modern era, as best as it can tell.",
      "Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole, assuming that county prosecutors get their own indictment for first-degree murder. But federal authorities intend to use their power to try Boelter first.",
      "Authorities say Boelter shot and wounded Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin before shooting and killing the Hortmans in their home in the northern Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, a few miles away.",
      "Federal prosecutors allege Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers. Prosecutors also say he listed dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states. Friends described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",
      "Boelter's wife, Jenny, issued a statement through her own lawyers Thursday saying she and her children are \u201cabsolutely shocked, heartbroken and completely blindsided,\u201d and expressing sympathy for the Hortman and Hoffman families. She is not in custody and has not been charged.",
      "\u201cThis violence does not align at all with our beliefs as a family,\" her statement said. \"It is a betrayal of everything we hold true as tenets of our Christian faith. We are appalled and horrified by what occurred and our hearts are incredibly heavy for the victims of this unfathomable tragedy.\u201d",
      "An FBI agent\u2019s affidavit described the Boelters as \u201cpreppers,\u201d people who prepare for major or catastrophic incidents. Investigators seized 48 guns from his home, according to search warrant documents.",
      "While the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit said law enforcement stopped Boelter\u2019s wife as she traveled with her four children north of the Twin Cities in Onamia on the day of the shootings, she said in her statement that she was not pulled over. She said that after she got a call from authorities, she immediately drove to meet them at a nearby gas station and has fully cooperated with investigators.",
      "\u201cWe thank law enforcement for apprehending Vance and protecting others from further harm,\" she said.",

      "DENVER -- A Colorado funeral home owner accused of stashing nearly 190 dead bodies in a decrepit building and sending grieving families fake ashes is set to be sentenced Friday in federal court for cheating customers and defrauding the government out of nearly $900,000 in COVID-19 aid.",
      "Jon Hallford, owner of Return to Nature Funeral Home, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud last year and faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. Federal prosecutors are seeking a 15-year sentence.",

      "Hallford and co-owner Carie Hallford were accused of storing the bodies between 2019 and 2023 and sending families fake ashes. Investigators described finding the bodies in 2023 stacked atop each other throughout a squat, bug-infested building in Penrose, a small town about a two-hour drive south of Denver.",
      "The morbid discovery revealed to many families that their loved ones weren't cremated and that the ashes they had spread or cherished were fake. In two cases, the wrong body was buried, according to court documents. Many families said it undid their grieving processes. Some relatives had nightmares, others have struggled with guilt, and at least one wondered about their loved one's soul.",
      "Federal prosecutors accused both Hallfords of pandemic aid fraud, siphoning the aid and spending it and customer's payments on a GMC Yukon and Infiniti worth over $120,000 combined, along with $31,000 in cryptocurrency, luxury items from stores like Gucci and Tiffany & Co., and even laser body sculpting.",
      "Carie Hallford is scheduled to go to trial in the federal case in September, the same month as her next hearing in the state case in which she's also charged with 191 counts of corpse abuse.",

      "School districts around the country are cutting back plans to expand their staffing of mental health specialists because of Trump administration cuts to federal grants",
      "WASHINGTON -- In parts of rural upstate New York, schools have more than 1,100 students for every mental health provider. In a far-flung region with little public transportation, those few school counselors often are the only mental health professionals available to students.",
      "Hennessey Lustica has been overseeing grant-funded efforts to train and hire more school psychologists, counselors and social workers in the Finger Lakes region, but those efforts may soon come to end \u2014 a casualty of the Trump administration's decision to cancel school mental health grants around the country.",
      "\u201cCutting this funding is just going to devastate kids,\u201d said Lustica, project director of the Wellness Workforce Collaborative in the Seneca Falls Central School District. \u201cThe workforce that we\u2019re developing, just in my 21 school districts it\u2019s over 20,000 kids that are going to be impacted by this and not have the mental health support that they need.\u201d",
      "The $1 billion in grants for school-based mental health programs were part of a sweeping gun violence bill signed by President Joe Biden in 2022 in response to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The grants were meant to help schools hire more psychologists, counselors and other mental health workers, especially in rural areas.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the department prioritized applicants who showed how they would increase the number of providers from diverse backgrounds, or from communities directly served by the school district. But President Donald Trump\u2019s administration took issue with aspects of the grant programs that touched on race, saying they were harmful to students.",
      "\u201cWe owe it to American families to ensure that taxpayer dollars are supporting evidence-based practices that are truly focused on improving students\u2019 mental health,\u201d Education Department spokesperson Madi Biedermann said.",
      "Lustica learned of her grant's cancellation in April in a two-page letter from the Education Department, which said the government found that her work violated civil rights law. It did not specify how.",
      "Lustica is planning to appeal the decision. She rejected the letter's characterization of her work, saying she and her colleagues abide by a code of ethics that honors each person\u2019s individuality, regardless of race, gender or identity.",
      "\u201cThe rhetoric is just false,\u201d Lustica said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to say it. I think if you looked at these programs and looked at the impact that these programs have in our rural school districts, and the stories that kids will tell you about the mental health professionals that are in their schools, it has helped them because of this program.\u201d",
      "The grants supported programs in districts across the country. In California, West Contra Costa Unified School District will lose nearly $4 million in funding. In Alabama, Birmingham City Schools was notified it would not receive the rest of a $15 million grant it was using to train, hire and retain mental health staff.",
      "In Wisconsin, the state\u2019s Department of Public Instruction will lose $8 million allocated for the next four years. The state had used the money to boost retention and expand programs to encourage high schoolers to pursue careers in school-based mental health.",
      "\u201cAt a time when communities are urgently asking for help serving mental health needs, this decision is indefensible,\u201d state superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement.",
      "In recent House and Senate hearings, Democrats pressed Education Secretary Linda McMahon on the end of the grants and the impact on students. McMahon told them mental health is a priority and the grants would be rebid and reissued.",
      "\u201cAnyone who works or spends time with kids knows these grants were funding desperately needed access to mental health care services,\u201d American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten said in a statement. \u201cCanceling the funding now is a cruel, reckless act that puts millions of children at risk.\u201d",
      "The strains on youth mental health are acute in many rural school districts.",
      "In one upstate New York district, half the students have had to move due to economic hardship in the last five years, creating instability that can affect their mental health, Lustica said. In a survey of students from sixth through 12th grade in one county, nearly half reported feeling sad or depressed most of the time; one in three said their lives lacked clear purpose or meaning.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got huge amounts of depression, huge amounts of anxiety, lots of trauma and not enough providers,\u201d Lustica said. \u201cSchool is the place where kids are getting a lot of the services they need.\u201d",
      "Some families in the region are unable to afford private counseling or are unable to get their children to appointments given transportation challenges, said Danielle Legg, a graduate student who did an internship as a school social worker with funding from the grant program.",
      "\u201cTheir access to mental health care truly is limited to when they're in school and there's a provider there that can see them, and it's vital,\u201d Legg said.",
      "In the past three years, 176 students completed their mental health training through the program Lustica oversees, and 85% of them were hired into shortage areas, she said.",
      "The program that offered training to graduate students at schools helped address staffing needs and inspired many to pursue careers in educational settings, said Susan McGowan, a school social worker who supervised graduate students in Geneva City School District.",
      "\u201cIt just feels, to me, really catastrophic,\u201d McGowan said of the grant cancellation. \u201cThese positions are difficult to fill, so when you get grad students who are willing to work hand in hand with other professionals in their building, you're actually building your capacity as far as staffing goes and you're supporting teachers.\u201d",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- Two smugglers convicted of federal charges in connection with the deaths of 53 migrants found in the back of a sweltering tractor-trailer in Texas in 2022 face up to life in prison when they are scheduled to be sentenced Friday.",
      "Felipe Orduna-Torres and Armando Gonzales-Ortega are to be the first of several defendants sentenced in the San Antonio tragedy, which remains the nation's deadliest human smuggling attempt across the U.S.-Mexico border. A jury convicted the men in March of being part of a human smuggling conspiracy that resulted in death and injury.",
      "Prosecutors described Orduna-Torres as the leader of the smuggling operation inside the U.S. and Gonzales-Ortega as his top assistant.",
      "The immigrants had come from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and had paid between $12,000 and $15,000 each to be smuggled into the United States, according to an indictment in the case. They had made it as far as the Texas border city of Laredo when they were placed into a tractor-trailer with broken air conditioning for a three-hour drive to San Antonio.",
      "As the temperature rose inside the trailer, those inside screamed and banged the walls of the trailer for help or tried to claw their way out, investigators said. Most eventually passed out. When the trailer was opened in San Antonio, 48 people were already dead. Another 16 were taken to hospitals, where five more died. The dead included six children and a pregnant woman.",
      "Investigators said the Orduna-Torres and Gonzales-Ortega worked with human smuggling operations in Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, and shared routes, guides, stash houses, trucks and trailers. Orduna-Torres provided the address in Laredo where they would be picked up, and Gonzalez-Ortega met them there.",
      "Five other men previously pleaded guilty to felony charges in the smuggling case, including the truck driver Homero Zamorano Jr., who was found hiding near the trailer in some bushes. Zamorano faces up to life in prison when sentenced in December. The other defendants are scheduled to be sentenced later this year.",
      "The incident is the deadliest among tragedies that have claimed thousands of lives in recent decades as people attempt to cross the U.S. border from Mexico. Ten immigrants died in 2017 after they were trapped inside a truck parked at a Walmart store in San Antonio. In 2003, the bodies of 19 immigrants were found in a sweltering truck southeast of San Antonio.",

      "A mother and her two young kids are fighting for their release from a Texas immigration detention center in what is believed to be the first lawsuit involving children challenging the Trump administration's policy on immigrant arrests at courthouses.",
      "The lawsuit filed Tuesday argues that the family's arrests after fleeing Honduras and entering the U.S. legally using a Biden-era appointment app violate the family\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizure and their Fifth Amendment right to due process.",
      "\u201cThe big picture is that the executive branch cannot seize people, arrest people, detain people indefinitely when they are complying with exactly what our government has required of them,\u201d said Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee, one of the lawyers representing the family.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "Starting in May, the country has seen large-scale arrests in which asylum-seekers appearing at routine court hearings have been arrested outside courtrooms as part of the White House\u2019s mass deportation effort. In many cases, a judge will grant a government lawyer\u2019s request to dismiss deportation proceedings and then U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will arrest the person and place them on \u201cexpedited removal,\" a fast track to deportation.",
      "Mukherjee said this is the first lawsuit filed on behalf of children to challenge the ICE courthouse arrest policy.",
      "There have been other similar lawsuits, such as in New York, where a federal judge ruled earlier this month that federal immigration authorities can\u2019t make civil arrests at the state's courthouses or arrest anyone going there for a proceeding.",
      "The Texas lawsuit was filed using initials for the children and \u201cMs. Z\u201d for the mother. Their identities have not been released because of concerns for the family\u2019s safety.",
      "As the family has been held for a month in the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, the mother has watched her 6-year-old son's health decline, Mukherjee said. He recently underwent chemotherapy treatment for leukemia and because of his arrest missed his check-in doctor\u2019s appointment, Mukherjee said. In the weeks since, he has lost his appetite.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s easily bruising. He has bone pain. He looks pale,\" Mukherjee said. \"His mom is terrified that these are symptoms that his leukemia situation might be deteriorating.\u201d",
      "The mother, son and 9-year-old daughter fled Honduras in October 2024 due to death threats, according to the lawsuit. They entered the U.S. using the CBP One app and were paroled into the country by the Department of Homeland Security, which determined they didn\u2019t pose a danger to the community, Mukherjee said. They were told to appear at a Los Angeles immigration court May 29.",
      "President Donald Trump ended CBP One for new entrants on his first day in office after more than 900,000 people had been allowed in the country using the app since it was expanded to include migrants in January 2023.",
      "During the family's hearing, the mother tried to explain to the judge that they wished to continue their cases for asylum, Mukherjee said. Homeland Security moved to dismiss their cases, and the judge immediately granted that motion.",
      "When they stepped out of the courtroom, they found men in civilian clothing believed to be ICE agents who arrested the family, Mukherjee said. They were transported to an immigrant processing center in Los Angeles, where they spent about 11 hours and were each only given an apple, a small packet of cookies, a juice box and water.",
      "At one point, an officer near the boy lifted his shirt, revealing his gun. The boy urinated on himself and was left in wet clothing until the next morning, Mukherjee said.",
      "They were later taken to the processing center, where they have been held ever since.",
      "\u201cThe family is suffering in this immigration detention center,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids are crying every night. They\u2019re praying to God for their release from this detention center.\"",
      "Their lawyers have filed an appeal of the immigration judge's May decision, but they're at risk of being deported within days because the government says they are subjected to expedited removal, Mukherjee said.",
      "The arrests of the family were illegal and unjustified, said Kate Gibson Kumar, an attorney for the Texas Civil Rights project who is also representing the family.",
      "She said the government had already decided when they first entered the country that the family didn\u2019t need to be detained.",
      "\u201cThe essential question in our case is, when you have these families who are doing everything right, especially with young children, should there be some protection there?\" Gibson Kumar said. \"We say \u2018yes.'\u201d",

      "Professors and students at the University of Alabama say that a new an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion law has already caused significant harm on campus less than a year after going into effect",
      "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Professors and students at the University of Alabama testified on Thursday that a new an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion law has jeopardized funding and changed curriculum, as a federal judge weighs whether the legislation is constitutional before the new school year begins.",
      "The new state law, SB129, followed a slew of proposals from Republican lawmakers across the country taking aim at DEI programs on college campuses. Universities across the country have shuttered or rebranded student affinity groups and DEI offices.",
      "The law prohibits public schools and universities from using state funds for any curriculum that endorses or compels assent to viewpoints about eight \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d related to race, religion, gender identity and religion. Instructors are also prohibited from encouraging a person feel guilt because of those identities. Schools are still allowed to facilitate \u201cobjective\u201d discussions on those topics, according to the law.",
      "Dana Patton, a political science professor at the University of Alabama, was one of six professors and students who sued the school and Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in January, arguing that the law violates the First Amendment by placing viewpoint-based restrictions on educators\u2019 speech. The lawsuit also argued that the law unconstitutionally targets Black students because it emphasizes concepts related to race and limits programs that benefit Black students.",
      "Shortly after the law took effect in October, Patton said that school officials told her that five students had made complaints suggesting that the interdisciplinary honors program she administered had potential conflicts with the new legislation. The program focuses on social justice and community service.",
      "University officials said a \u201cpowerful person\u201d in the state Capitol was behind the five student complaints, Patton testified.",
      "The complaints alleged the program \u201cpromoted socialism\u201d and focused on \u201csystematic racism\" and \u201cproducing engaged global citizens as opposed to patriotic Americans,\u201d according to evidence presented at the hearing. The complaints also said students \u201cfeel unsafe\u201d because \u201cthe leadership of the program has a clear view of the world from a divisive perspective.\"",
      "\u201cI was completely shocked, stunned,\" Patton said.",
      "After weeks of meetings where Patton exhaustively laid out the content of her courses to administrators, she said she was introduced to Alabama Republican Rep. Danny Garrett at a school football game.",
      "Garret told her that \u201cwe need compromise here\u201d because the legislators involved in the complaints are \u201ctenacious\u201d and \u201cnot going to let this go.\u201d He then sent her links to work he had done with Black Democratic state legislators after the death of George Floyd to address racial tension.",
      "Patton said the conversation \u201cvery much felt like a threat\u201d because Garrett is the chair of the Alabama House Ways and Means Education Committee, which is one of two legislative committees that oversees the university's funding.",
      "The tenured professor said she has since removed some course material from her syllabus and is no longer posting slides of her lectures online, out of fear that her lessons might be misinterpreted.",
      "Garrett declined to comment on the pending litigation.",
      "Jay Ezelle, the defense attorney for the University of Alabama Board of Trustees, said the school had an obligation to investigate if students complain about being tested on an opinion, not on a performance.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s violated, the university has to investigate, correct?\u201d Ezelle asked during cross-examination.",
      "He added that the law had not created any measurable harm against the plaintiffs, because no faculty had been terminated or formally disciplined, and school administrators had sourced private funding for some affinity groups, who still have access to campus facilities.",
      "Other professors testified that they felt compelled to pull class assignments or stop offering classes altogether based on Patton\u2019s experience, as well as formal instruction from the university about the \u201crisks\u201d of testing students on divisive concepts.",
      "Rising senior Sydney Testman said she lost her scholarship because it was tied to her job at the Social Justice Advocacy Council, which was terminated after the anti-DEI legislation went into effect.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to say it's disproportionately affecting Black people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe vibes are kind of 'everyone fend for yourselves.'\u201d",
      "Federal U.S. Chief Judge R. David Proctor said the case will largely hinge on whether classroom speech is protected under the First Amendment and whether the state has a right to influence curriculum. Proctor will also consider if the six students and professors who brought the lawsuit against the University of Alabama have been harmed by the new law.",
      "He said he will make a decision in time for Alabama schools to have \u201cclarity by the start of school.\u201d",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho judge says he won't postpone the quadruple murder trial of a man accused in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students.",
      "Fourth District Judge Steven Hippler made the ruling Thursday, telling Bryan Kohberger\u2019s attorneys that jury selection will begin in August and opening arguments will likely be held around Aug. 18.",
      "Hippler also rejected the defense team's request to present theories of four \u201calternate perpetrators\u201d to the jury, writing that evidence presented by the defense is \u201centirely irrelevant.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing links these individuals to the homicides or otherwise gives rise to a reasonable inference that they committed the crime; indeed, it would take nothing short of rank speculation by the jury to make such a finding,\u201d Hippler wrote in the order.",
      "Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at Washington State University, is charged with four counts of murder. Prosecutors say he sneaked into a rental home in nearby Moscow, Idaho, not far from the University of Idaho campus, and fatally stabbed Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "Kohberger stood silent at his arraignment, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",
      "Defense attorney Anne Taylor had asked the judge to delay the proceedings. She said beginning the trial this summer would violate Kohberger\u2019s right to a fair trial in part because his defense team was still reviewing evidence and struggling to get potential witnesses to agree to be interviewed. She also said extensive publicity could taint the proceedings and that a cooling off period would help ensure an impartial jury.",
      "But Hippler noted that interest in the case has only grown and that previous delays have only given the media more time to \u201cprovide coverage to a public audience which is clamoring for answers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe longer the public is made to sit and wait for the facts to come out at trial, the more time there is for inflammatory, speculative stories, movies and books to circulate and more time for prior ones to be rebroadcast, purchased, viewed and consumed by the public,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Hippler also denied the defense's request to present evidence of four \u201calternate perpetrators\u201d to jurors, after finding that evidence was flimsy at best and would lead to \u201cwild speculation,\" needlessly dragging out a trial that is already expected to last three months.",
      "The names of the four were redacted from the ruling, but Hippler briefly described them: Three of the people were socially connected to at least one of the victims, and interacted with them socially in the hours before the killings, lived within walking distance of the home and had been to the home before. The fourth person had only a \u201cpassing connection\u201d to one victim after noticing her at a store several weeks before the deaths, Hippler said.",
      "All four cooperated with investigators, and their DNA didn't match samples taken at the crime scene, Hippler said, and there is no admissible or significant evidence that any one of them had a motive, was present at the crime scene or was otherwise connected to the crime.",
      "\u201cThere is not a scintilla of competent evidence connecting them to the crime,\u201d Hippler said.",
      "Jury selection will begin Aug. 4, Hippler said, with the trial starting about two weeks later.",

      "A federal judge is blocking Georgia's law requiring age verification for social media accounts",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia has become the latest state where a federal judge has blocked a law requiring age verification for social media accounts.",
      "Like in seven other states where such laws have been blocked, a federal judge ruled Thursday that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg means that the Georgia measure, which passed in 2024, won't take effect next week as scheduled. Instead, Totenberg granted a preliminary injunction blocking the law until there's a full ruling on the issue.",
      "Georgia's law would require some social media providers to take \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d steps to verify a user's age and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. It was challenged by NetChoice, a trade group representing online businesses.",
      "\u201cThe state seeks to erect barriers to speech that cannot withstand the rigorous scrutiny that the Constitution requires,\u201d Totenberg wrote, finding the law restricts the rights of minors, chills the right to anonymous speech online and restricts the ability of people to receive speech from social media platforms.",
      "Georgia will appeal, a spokesperson for Attorney General Chris Carr said Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to defend commonsense measures that empower parents and protect our children online,\u201d spokesperson Kara Murray said in a statement.",
      "Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety. Totenberg said concerns about social media harming children are legitimate, but don\u2019t outweigh the constitutional violation.",
      "Totenberg wrote that NetChoice\u2019s members would be irreparably harmed by the law. She rejected arguments from the state that the group shouldn\u2019t get temporary relief because it had delayed filing its lawsuit by a year and because the state would be required to give 90 days\u2019 notice before enforcing the law.",
      "\u201cFree expression doesn\u2019t end where government anxiety begins,\" NetChoice Director of Litigation Chris Marchese said in a statement. \"Parents\u2014 not politicians \u2014 should guide their children\u2019s lives online and offline\u2014 and no one should have to hand over a government ID to speak in digital spaces.\u201d",
      "It's the ninth state where NetChoice has blocked a law over children's use of social media. In Arkansas and Ohio, federal judges have permanently overturned the laws. Besides Georgia, measures are also on hold in California, Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Utah. Louisiana agreed to not enforce its law while litigation proceeds. Only in Tennessee did a federal judge decline to temporarily block a law, finding NetChoice hadn't proved that people would be irreparably harmed if the law wasn't blocked before trial.",
      "Georgia had argued the law was meant to protect children in a dangerous place, likening it to banning them from bars serving alcohol instead of restricting their speech.",

      "A few Republicans are reacting with indignation after the Senate parliamentarian advised that some of the measures in their tax and immigration bill could not be included in the legislation",
      "WASHINGTON -- A few Republicans reacted with indignation Thursday after the Senate parliamentarian advised that some of the measures in their tax and immigration bill could not be included in the legislation.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., tweeted on X that Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough should be fired, \u201cASAP.\u201d Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., intimated that she was partisan, asking why an \u201cunelected swamp bureaucrat, who was appointed by Harry Reid over a decade ago\u201d gets to decide what\u2019s in the bill?\u201d",
      "It's hardly the first time the parliamentarian's normally low-key and lawyerly role has drawn a blast of public criticism.",
      "MacDonough also dashed Democratic plans over the years, advising in 2021 that they couldn't include a minimum wage increase in their COVID-19 relief bill. Later that same year, she advised that Democrats needed to drop an effort to let millions of immigrants remain temporarily in the U.S. as part of their big climate bill.",
      "But the attention falling on MacDonough's rulings in recent years also reflects a broader change in Congress, with lawmakers increasingly trying to wedge their top policy priorities into bills that can't be filibustered in the Senate. The process comes with special rules designed to deter provisions unrelated to spending or taxes \u2014 and that's where the parliamentarian comes in, offering analysis of what does and doesn't qualify.",
      "Her latest round of decisions Thursday was a blow to the GOP\u2019s efforts to wring hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid over the next decade. Senate Republicans could opt to try to override her recommendations, but they are unlikely to do so.",
      "Here's a closer look at what the Senate parliamentarian does and why lawmakers are so focused on her recommendations right now.",
      "Both the House and Senate have a parliamentarian to provide assistance on that chamber's rules and precedents. They are often seen advising whoever is presiding over the chamber on the proper procedures to be followed and the appropriate responses to a parliamentary inquiry.",
      "They are also charged with providing information to lawmakers and their respective staff on a strictly nonpartisan and confidential basis.",
      "The parliamentarians and their staff only offer advice. Their recommendations are not binding. In the case of the massive tax and spending bill now before both chambers, the parliamentarian plays a critical role in advising whether the reconciliation bill's provisions remain focused on fiscal issues.",
      "MacDonough, an English literature major, is the Senate\u2019s first woman to be parliamentarian and just the sixth person to hold the position since its creation in 1935.",
      "She began her Senate career in its library before leaving to get a law degree at Vermont Law School. She worked briefly as a Justice Department trial attorney before returning to the Senate in 1999, this time as an assistant in the parliamentarian\u2019s office. She was initially appointed parliamentarian in 2012 by Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada, Senate majority leader at the time. She was retained by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., when he became majority leader in 2015.",
      "She helped Chief Justice John Roberts preside over Trump\u2019s 2020 Senate impeachment trial and was beside then-Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., for Trump\u2019s second trial the following year. Trump was acquitted both times.",
      "When Trump supporters fought past police and into the Capitol in hopes of disrupting Congress\u2019 certification of Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory, MacDonough and other staffers rescued those ballots and hustled mahogany boxes containing them to safety. MacDonough\u2019s office, on the Capitol\u2019s first floor, was ransacked and declared a crime scene.",
      "Yes. The parliamentarian makes the recommendation, but it's the presiding officer overseeing Senate proceedings who rules on provisions in the bill. If there is a dispute, it would be put to a vote.",
      "Michael Thorning, director of structural democracy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, said he doubts Republicans will want to go that route. And indeed, some Republican senators said as much Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the institutional integrity, even if I\u2019m convinced 100% she\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.",
      "Thorning said lawmakers from both parties view MacDonough as \u201cvery much an honest broker.\u201d",
      "\"And the Senate relies on her,\u201d Thorning said. \u201cSometimes, those decisions cut your way, and sometimes, they don't. I also think members recognize that once you start treating the parliamentarian's advice as just something that could be easily dismissed, then the rules start to matter less.\u201d",
      "Majority leaders from both parties have replaced the parliamentarian. For more than three decades, the position alternated between Robert Dove and Alan Frumin depending upon which party was in the majority.",
      "Thorning said the two parliamentarians weren't far apart though, in how they interpreted the Senate's rules and precedents.",
      "MacDonough succeeded Frumin as parliamentarian. He said the small number of calls Thursday for her dismissal \u201ctells you all people need to know about the current parliamentarian.\u201d",
      "\u201cSenators know this isn't somebody playing politics,\u201d Thorning said.",

      "The Chiefs have requested an extension to the end-of-June deadline for a stadium financing package from the state of Kansas in a letter to the Kansas Senate president",
      "LENEXA, Kan. -- The Kansas City Chiefs have requested an extension to an end-of-June deadline for a stadium financing package from the state of Kansas, an indication that the NFL franchise's potential move across the state line from Missouri is a legitimate possibility.",
      "Chiefs president Mark Donovan requested the extension Thursday in a letter to Kansas Senate president Ty Masterson, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. Donovan explained that the Chiefs have made \u201csignificant progress\u201d on plans for a new stadium development but that more time is needed to \u201cbring the effort to full fruition.\u201d",
      "The Kansas Legislative Coordinating Council is scheduled to meet July 7 to consider extending the incentive deadline.",
      "\u201cThe letter from Mark Donovan indicates that the drive to bring this historic project to Kansas is moving down the field,\u201d Masterson said in a statement. \u201cNow that we are in the red zone, this extension will provide stakeholders sufficient time to ensure the ball crosses the goal line.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex on the east side of Kansas City, Missouri, where Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium share parking facilities. But leases with Jackson County are due to expire in January 2031, and the two franchises have been trying to plot a course forward for years.",
      "Donovan indicated in his letter to Masterson that Kansas remains an enticing option.",
      "\u201cTogether,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe have the opportunity to bring the National Football League to Kansas, anchored by a world-class domed stadium, new team headquarters, a state-of-the-art practice facility, and a vibrant mixed-use and entertainment district.\u201d",
      "Last year, Jackson County voters defeated a sales tax extension that would have helped to finance an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium \u2014 the home of the Chiefs \u2014 and a $2 billion ballpark district for the Royals in downtown Kansas City.",
      "While local and state officials in Missouri were considering another a stadium financing package, lawmakers in Kansas quickly and aggressively authorized bonds for up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums to be built in their state.",
      "Many believed the Chiefs and Royals would use the Kansas offer as leverage for a better deal from Missouri \u2014 including Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas, who acknowledged that \"the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\u201d",
      "Finally, earlier this month, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers into a special session to approve a stadium financing deal that included disaster relief for the St. Louis area, where a series of devastating tornadoes caused widespread damage. The legislation authorizes bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums in Missouri, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.",
      "The prevailing belief was that the package would be enough to keep the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, where they have floated plans for a $1.15 billion renovation, and perhaps hold onto the Royals, who are still interested in building downtown.",
      "Yet news surfaced about a month ago that an affiliate of the Royals purchased the mortgage on a large property in the southern Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kansas, raising the possibility of building a new stadium and ballpark district there.",
      "And the letter from Donovan requesting an extension in Kansas indicates the Chiefs also are serious about switching states.",
      "Chiefs owner Clark Hunt has long professed his affinity for Arrowhead Stadium, which was built by his father and team founder Lamar Hunt. But he also is keenly aware of the revenue streams available by building a new domed stadium, including the chance to host the Super Bowl, the Final Four and other marquee sporting events.",
      "It is unclear where the Chiefs would build in Kansas, but one possibility is the juncture of Interstates 435 and 70 in Kansas City, Kansas. That's the site of Kansas Speedway, a mixed residential and commercial district called The Legends, the home stadiums of MLS club Sporting Kansas City and the Kansas City Monarchs minor league baseball club, as well as a casino, hotels, a major soccer training center and the infrastructure necessary to support a domed football stadium.",
      "\u201cWe are excited about the potential for this project, which would represent the largest economic development initiative in the state\u2019s history,\" Donovan wrote in his letter Thursday. \"Just as important, the presence of an NFL franchise in (Kansas) will serve as a powerful engine for immediate and long term-growth \u2014 driving national attention, sustained tourism, and billions more in private development across the state.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans agreed to remove the so-called revenge tax provision from President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill on Thursday after a request by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "The Section 899 provision that was nixed would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "The measure was expected to lead many companies to avoid investing in the U.S. out of concern that they could face steep taxes. But the removal of the provision adds a wrinkle to Republicans\u2019 plans to try to offset the cost of the massive package.",
      "Bessent said in an X post that he made the request to lawmakers after reaching an agreement with other countries on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Tax Deal. He said that after \u201cmonths of productive dialogue,\u201d they would \u201cannounce a joint understanding among G7 countries that defends American interests.\u201d",
      "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said they would remove the provision. But, they noted, \u201cCongressional Republicans stand ready to take immediate action if the other parties walk away from this deal or slow walk its implementation.\u201d",
      "The removal of the provision will provide \u201cgreater certainty and stability for the global economy and will enhance growth and investment in the United States and beyond,\u201d Bessent said in his post.",
      "An analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would have cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product.",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among several groups that signed a letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Crapo warning of the consequences of Section 899.",
      "Republicans are rushing to finish the package this week to meet the president's Fourth of July deadline for passage.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Senate parliamentarian advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to the spending bill does not adhere to the chamber\u2019s procedural rules, delivering a crucial blow to Republicans, who are counting on big cuts to Medicaid and other programs to offset trillions of dollars in Trump tax breaks.",

      "\u201cIn the years leading up to the accident, Third Coast missed several opportunities to evaluate how geohazards may threaten the integrity of their pipeline. Information widely available within the industry suggested that land movement related to hurricane activity was a threat to pipelines in the Gulf of America, including the MPOG 18-inch pipeline,\u201d the NTSB said in its final report, using the new name assigned to the body of water by the Trump administration.",
      "Third Coast did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment about the report Thursday afternoon.",

      "The amount of oil spilled was far less than the 2010 BP oil disaster, when 134 million gallons were released in the weeks following an oil rig explosion, but it could have been much smaller if workers in the Third Coast control room had acted more quickly, the NTSB said.",
      "The pipeline operator first noticed pressure changes about 45 minutes after he started his shift at 6 p.m. on Nov. 15, 2023. The gauges showed that the volume of oil exiting the pipeline was less than the amount entering, with the output eventually dropping to zero around 12:30 a.m. the next morning.",
      "The controller said his supervisor recommended not shutting down the pipeline as the pressure dropped throughout the evening. Even after the flow went to zero, the controller and his colleagues decided not to shut it down because they believed the the data were the result of equipment issues.",
      "It was only after day shift workers started the next day and noticed the trend data and lack of output that Third Coast started to shut down the pipeline, around 6:30 a.m. It was fully shut down by 9 a.m., and the leak was reported to the Environmental Protection Agency less than an hour later.",

      "Critics have condemned the facility and what they call the state's apparent reliance on alligators as a security measure as a cruel spectacle, while DeSantis and other state officials have defended it as part of Florida's muscular efforts to carry out President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "Tribal leaders and environmentalists are urging the state to change course, noting billions of dollars in state and federal funds have been poured into Everglades restoration in recent years, an investment they say is jeopardized by plans to house some 1,000 migrants at the site for an undetermined amount of time.",

      "The deep penetrating bombs that the U.S. dropped into two Iranian nuclear facilities were designed specifically for those sites and were the result of more than 15 years of intelligence and weapons design work",
      "WASHINGTON -- The deep penetrating bombs that the U.S. dropped into two Iranian nuclear facilities were designed specifically for those sites and were the result of more than 15 years of intelligence and weapons design work, the Pentagon\u2019s top leaders said Thursday.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a press briefing that they are confident the weapons struck exactly as planned.",
      "Caine, the nation\u2019s top military officer, offered new details about the work that went into building the \u201cbunker-buster\u201d bombs and how the U.S. used them to burrow into the Iranian sites. He sought to show the level of destruction but did not directly address President Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that Tehran\u2019s nuclear program has been \u201cobliterated.\u201d",
      "The bombs, called the GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator, have their roots in a decades-old classified briefing \u201cof what looked like a major construction project in the mountains of Iran,\u201d Caine said.",
      "That turned out to be the Fordo fuel enrichment plant, with construction believed to have started around 2006. It became operational in 2009, the same year Tehran publicly acknowledged its existence.",
      "The classified briefing was shown in 2009 to a Defense Threat Reduction Agency officer, who with a colleague \u201clived and breathed\u201d Fordo for the next 15 years, studying the geology, construction dig, the earth moved and \u201cevery piece of equipment going in and every piece of equipment going out,\" Caine said.",
      "What they concluded: The U.S. didn't have a bomb that could destroy those sites. So the Pentagon got to work, Caine said.",
      "\u201cWe had so many Ph.D.s working on the mock program \u2014 doing modeling and simulation \u2014 that we were quietly and in a secret way the biggest users of supercomputer hours within the United States of America,\u201d he said.",
      "The 30,000-pound bomb is comprised of steel, explosive and a fuse programmed to a specific detonation time. The longer the fuse, the deeper the weapon will penetrate before exploding.",
      "Over the years, the military tested and retested it hundreds of times on mock facilities, Caine said. Crews fine-tuned the bombs to detonate in the mock enrichment rooms, delaying detonation until they had reached a position to send a pressure blast through open tunnels to destroy equipment underground.",
      "Fordo had two main ventilation routes into the underground facility \u2014 and officials carefully eyed these entry points as a way to target the site.",
      "Each route had three shafts \u2014 a main shaft and a smaller shaft on either side, which looked almost like a pitchfork in graphics provided by the Pentagon. In the days preceding the U.S. attack, Iran placed large concrete slabs on top of both ventilation routes to try to protect them, Caine said.",
      "In response, the U.S. crafted an attack plan where six bunker-buster bombs would be used against each ventilation route, using the main shaft as a way down into the enrichment facility.",
      "Seven B-2 stealth bombers were used, carrying two of the massive munitions apiece. The first bomb was used to eliminate the concrete slab, Caine said.",
      "The next four bombs were dropped down the main shaft and into the complex at a speed of more than 1,000 feet per second before exploding, he said. A sixth bomb was dropped as a backup, in case anything went wrong.",
      "In addition to the 12 bombs dropped on Fordo, with six on each ventilation route, two more hit Iran's main Natanz facility, Caine said.",
      "Each crew was able to confirm detonation as they saw the bombs drop from the aircraft in front of them: \u201cWe know that the trailing jets saw the first weapons function,\u201d Caine said.",
      "The pilots reported back that it was the brightest explosion they had ever seen \u2014 that it looked like daylight, he said.",
      "Caine said the munitions were built, tested and loaded properly, guided to their intended targets and then exploded as designed.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s nuclear facilities have been destroyed,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "However, questions remained as to whether the highly enriched uranium that Iran would need to develop a nuclear weapon was at the site at the time. Asked repeatedly, Hegseth did not say if the uranium had been destroyed or moved.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any intelligence that I\u2019ve reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise,\u201d Hegseth said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is letting South Carolina block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is letting South Carolina block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that states can bar Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider.",
      "The federal government and many states already block using Medicaid funds to cover abortion. But the state-federal health insurance program for lower-income people does pay for other services from Planned Parenthood, including birth control, cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.",
      "The ruling comes at a moment when Congress is considering blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal Medicaid funding, a move that the group says would force hundreds of clinic closings \u2014 most of them in states where abortion remains legal.",
      "Here are things to know about the situation:",
      "This legal dispute goes back to a 2018 executive order from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster that barred abortion providers from receiving Medicaid money in the state, even for services unrelated to abortion.",
      "In its 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court overruled lower courts and said that patients don't necessarily have the right to sue for Medicaid to cover their health care from specific providers.",
      "Abortion opponents hail it as a victory on principle.",
      "\u201cNo one should be forced to subsidize abortion,\u201d CatholicVote President Kelsey Reinhardt said in a statement.",
      "Supporters of Planned Parenthood see the ruling as an obstacle to health care aside from abortion.",
      "Planned Parenthood \u201cprovides services for highly disadvantaged populations and this will mean not only that many women in the state will lose their right to choose providers, but it will also mean that many women will lose services altogether,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, who specializes in public health law at Georgetown Law.",
      "For many people with Medicaid, Gostin said, Planned Parenthood is a trusted service provider, and it's often the closest one.",
      "Others emphasize that the people who could be most impacted are women who already face the greatest obstacles to getting health care.",
      "\u201cPeople enrolled in Medicaid, including young people and people of color, already face too many barriers to getting health care,\u201d Kimberly Inez McGuire, the executive director of Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equality, said in a statement. \u201cThis decision makes a difficult situation worse.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood has two clinics in South Carolina, one in Charleston and one in Columbia.",
      "Combined, they\u2019ve been receiving about $90,000 a year from Medicaid out of nearly $9 billion a year the program spends in the state.",
      "South Carolina has banned most abortions after six weeks gestational age, before many women realize they\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s one of four states to bar abortion at that point. Another 12 are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy. The bans were implemented after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "The most recent high court ruling isn't a guarantee that other states will follow South Carolina's lead, but Republican attorneys general of 18 other states filed court papers supporting the state's position in the case.",
      "\u201cWe can imagine that there\u2019s anti-abortion legislators in states who are looking to this case and may try to replicate what South Carolina has done,\" said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "The U.S. House last month passed a budget measure that would bar all federal payments for 10 years to nonprofit groups that provide abortion and received more than $1 million in federal funding in 2024.",
      "A Senate vote on the measure, which President Donald Trump supports, could happen in coming days.",
      "Planned Parenthood says that if the measure becomes law, it would force its affiliates to close up to 200 of their 600 facilities across the U.S. The hardest-hit places would be the states where abortion is legal.",
      "If the federal effort is successful, Friedrich-Karnik said states that support abortion rights could use their own tax revenue to keep clinics open.",
      "On a call with reporters this week, SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said it's a priority for her group to hobble Planned Parenthood.",
      "She said starving Planned Parenthood of Medicaid reimbursements would not have a major impact on patients, because other clinics offer similar services without providing abortion.",
      "\u201cMedicaid money is attached to the person, so she\u2019ll retain the same amount of money,\u201d Dannenfelser said. \u201cShe\u2019ll just take it to a different place.\u201d",
      "The 2022 Supreme Court ruling that ended the nationwide right to abortion jolted the abortion system across the U.S. and left clinics struggling.",
      "Women in states with bans in place now use abortion pills or travel to states where it's legal.",
      "Surveys have found that the number of monthly abortions nationally has risen since the court ruling.",
      "But over the same time period, some clinics have closed and funds that help people obtain abortion have said it's hard to stretch their money to cover the added cost of travel.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u00a0was portrayed in his lawyer's closing argument on Friday as the victim of an overzealous prosecution that tried to turn the recreational use of drugs and a swinger lifestyle into a racketeering conspiracy that could put the music mogul behind bars for life.",
      "Attorney Marc Angifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began a presentation expected to last several hours.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of the\u00a0swinger lifestyle and threesomes\u00a0to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo also called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made their closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",
      "The defense\u00a0rested\u00a0on Tuesday after presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. It didn't call any witnesses.",
      "Combs' lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "In federal prosecutors' closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury that Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",
      "\"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" she said.",
      "Prosecution will make a rebuttal argument after the defense's closing. Judge Arun Subramanian will then instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",

      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",

      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",

      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",

      "Although she admitted it's \"somewhat frustrating\" when music doesn't reach mainstream success, her dedicated fanbase never fails to find it.",
      "\"I always want people to choose to love my music. I don't want to shove it in anyone's face,\" she said.",
      "The origins of MARINA's journey",
      "The daughter of a Welsh mother and Greek father, MARINA moved from her hometown of Abergavenny, Wales, to London at 19. She was initially embarrassed to sing in public \u2014 but music felt like an \"innate calling.\"",
      "She overcame her stage fright \"painfully\" by going to open mic nights alone.",
      "\"I was like, if I'm bad, I need no one I know to see me be bad, which you can't do anymore, 'cause everyone's filming everything,\" she said, laughing.",
      "She launched her career with her 2010 debut \"The Family Jewels,\" then going by Marina and the Diamonds, followed by 2012's \"Electra Heart,\" which reached No. 1 on British charts.\u00a0But by 2016, success felt suffocating.",
      "\"And I just suddenly felt really trapped,\" she said. \"I felt like my identity was glued to my artist's identity. I just suddenly, like wanted out.\"",
      "Discovering health issues",
      "That same year, MARINA began experiencing mysterious symptoms that would later be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome.",
      "\"The main symptom actually was buzzing all over,\" she explained. \"And it always started in my feet then it would basically go all the way up my body \u2026 like my face would basically be throbbing. Like my whole body would feel like it was ringing.\"",
      "It took six years to understand the condition was connected to her nervous system. Breathwork ultimately provided relief.",
      "\"I have had to basically change my whole life, like inside out,\" she said.",
      "While MARINA stepped back from her career, her early music found new life on TikTok.",
      "\"It is strange because I was so used to like pushing to make things happen in my career. And then suddenly this whole thing, you get three platinum records by doing nothing,\" she said.",
      "Now living in Los Angeles, MARINA approaches each album with detailed planning, usually in a journal. But this time, she made an album map for \"Princess of Power\" which includes a color palette, themes and the kind of energy she wanted the music to have: cosmic, love rush, euphoric, dazzling, bright light and powerful.",
      "\"This album was different because I think I'm at the point where I'm not writing so much to like heal myself,\" she said. \"I was like, I have this platform, and I want to make sure that whatever I'm putting out into the world has a certain type of energy that feels positive to me \u2026 because that's what I really needed two years ago when I started writing this.\"",
      "\"You don't get to do this many times in your life, you know, as an artist,\" she continued. \"So, I was like, this is the time I'm gonna do this. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Performing these new songs allows MARINA to embody the transformation she's undergone.",
      "\"It's almost like making it public means I can suddenly step into it,\" she said. \"It's almost like I can finally say to people, 'This is who I am actually.' Like the person you knew four years ago has gone.\"",
      "That transformation represents more than recovery, it's a reclamation of her power.",

    "summary": "Bobby Sherman was a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

Two former girlfriends, including\u00a0Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura\u00a0and a woman using the pseudonym \"Jane\" took the stand and told the jury they did not want to participate in so-called \"freak offs,\" described as drug fueled sexual encounters with male escorts they said Combs would direct.",

      "The other four counts are sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "\"I think they've proved that prostitutes were moved from one state to another and that Diddy was involved,\" Schoenstein said.",
      "Schoenstein said the other counts are more debatable.",
      "\"Sex trafficking by force, and that's going to be more of an assessment of what the relationships between Diddy and Cassie and what Diddy and Jane were like and what the jury thinks of all that,\" Schoenstein said.",

    "summary": "His mother is a member of the Kennedy clan; his father was the Terminator. Now, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger, a standout in the HBO Max series \"The White Lotus,\" talks about how he chose to pursue a career while carrying the weight of a famous Hollywood name.",
    "story": [
      "\"Every time I'm out in, like, nature, that's kind of where I like to do my prayers or gratitude list,\" said Patrick Schwarzenegger. These days he is counting his blessings, even though the role he was recently blessed with is anything but reverent. He plays the much-talked-about (and much-hated) Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family visiting Thailand, in the latest incarnation of HBO's \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Saxon is a chiseled car crash \u2013 a sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro who is so irredeemably into his own masculinity, he offends even his own sister. How do you even audition for a part like that?",
      "Schwarzenegger says he was only given a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality: \"The wording was that ''He flirted with anything.' So, I just took the first few seconds and just kind of, you know, stared at the camera in a loving way.\"",
      "Did he have any reservations? \"Yes, I was worried,\" he said. \"I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character.\"",
      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular.

    "story": [
      "In 1967, this video introduced a new American band: The Doors, who would quickly light the music world on fire, with a sound hypnotic, mystical, and almost menacing:",
      "You know the day destroys the night Night divides the day Tried to run, tried to hide Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side, yeah",
      "They came together 60 years ago in Venice, California: Jim Morrison, a poet in leather pants, backed by Ray Manzarek on keys, Robby Krieger on guitar, and John Densmore on drums.",
      "The Doors soon got their break, in May of '66, at London Fog, a tiny nightclub on the Sunset Strip. It's now a barber shop. \"Oh, I need a haircut,\" laughed Densmore on a recent return visit.",
      "The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members.",
      "The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was \"the biggest deal in town.\"",
      "\"It was Mecca,\" Densmore added.",
      "The room isn't much different from what it was back then. \"The stage is lower,\" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. \"And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!\" he laughed.",
      "He described the improvisational attitude of the band: \"Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide \u2026 Break on through.'\"",
      "Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: \"He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?\"",
      "\"It was the words,\" Krieger said. \"They were so different than anything that was out there.\"",
      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",
      "Krieger said, \"He would try to spread the rumor Jim's not really dead.\"",
      "Why? \"He loved the mythology,\" Densmore replied.",
      "\"He lived for The Doors,\" said Krieger. \"I mean, that was his whole life, you know? And he didn't want it to be over.\"",
      "Manzarek died in 2013.",
      "The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book \"Night Divides the Day.\"",
      "To the end, The Doors were an improvisational group. One of their best-known songs grew out of another tune they were jamming on in a session. \"We were goofing around,\" said Densmore, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" morphed into \"Riders on the Storm.\" It would be Morrison's final recording.",
      "At the Whisky a Go Go every month, Krieger (now 79) has been playing a Doors album in its entirety. Densmore (80) recently sat in on drums.",
      "\"Well, these two geezers are still breathing,\" Densmore laughed. \"Keith and Mick are 80 and they're out there pumpin'. There's other roads!\"",

    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",

      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",

      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, inched higher in May, the latest sign that inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, according to the PCE data. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, up from a rate of 2.5% the previous month.",
      "While inflation ticked higher, prices across the U.S. haven't yet shown a major impact from the Trump administration's tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned earlier this week that inflation could reignite this summer as the import duties are passed through to consumers.",
      "Consumers also pared their spending last month, marking their first reduction since January, while incomes also dropped, the Commerce Department\u00a0said\u00a0on Friday. The pullback in spending, which dropped 0.1% last month, comes after Americans opened their wallets earlier in the year to buy goods before the tariffs took effect, economists said.",
      "\"While the spending numbers fell slightly and came in below expectations, we would not read too much into these numbers as this weakness is probably primarily just payback from the jump in spending earlier this year as consumers tried to buy goods ahead of the tariffs,\" Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Incomes dropped after a one-time adjustment to Social Security benefits had boosted payments in March and April. Social Security payments were raised for some retirees who had worked for state and local governments due to the Social Security Fairness Act.",
      "Modest impact from tariffs",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Trump's broad-based tariffs are still having only a modest effect on prices. The cost of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month's 0.1%.",
      "Economists point to several reasons why Trump's tariffs have yet to accelerate the pace of inflation, as many analysts had expected. Like American consumers, companies imported billions of dollars of goods in the spring before the duties kicked in, and many items currently on store shelves were imported without paying higher levies.",
      "Some businesses are also absorbing higher import costs, cushioning consumers from price hikes.",
      "\"For the moment, there is nothing of consequence to worry about on the inflation side of this report,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told clients in a research note. \"There is, however, an unexpected drop in consumer spending, the first since the pandemic.

      "The reception is expected to be held on Saturday at Arsenale, a sprawling brick complex and former shipyard that was used from the 12th century until World War I. It's best known today as one of the main venues for the Biennale cultural festivals, which include exhibitions on art, architecture, film, dance, music and theater.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "The event has put a spotlight on the uber-weathly, with local protestors pushing back against the event's extravagance.",
      "\"Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,\" Stella Faye, a university researcher from Venice,\u00a0told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "According to a new Oxfam report, the world's richest 1% have increased their wealth by more than $33.9 trillion since 2015.

      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protesters gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",

      "The plaintiffs argued that the fund is unlawful because Congress unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Consumers' Research and found that the combination of Congress' delegation to the FCC, and the commission's subdelegation to the fund administrator violates the Constitution.",

    "summary": "The U.S. and China have agreed on the framework for a trade deal, both nations say. It appears that rare earth minerals are one key part of it.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed on the framework for a trade deal, both nations say.",
      "President Trump said at a White House event Thursday that Washington and Beijing had signed an agreement on trade, adding that he expects to have a deal with India soon. But Beijing and the White House later referred to the development as an agreement on the framework for a deal.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg TV the deal was signed earlier this week. Neither Lutnick nor Mr. Trump provided any details about the accord.",
      "\"We just signed with China the other day,\" the president said.",
      "Lutnick said the deal was \"signed and sealed\" two days earlier.",
      "Rare earth minerals apparently at center stage",
      "It was unclear if the latest accord was different from the one Mr. Trump announced two weeks earlier that he said would make it easier for American industries to obtain much-needed magnets and rare earth minerals. That pact cleared the way for the trade talks to continue, while the U.S. agreed to stop trying to revoke visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that the two sides had \"further confirmed the details of the framework.\" But its statement didn't explicitly mention U.S. access to rare earths, minerals essential for hi-tech products such as defense equipment, electric vehicles and hard drives. China dominates world production of those minerals.",
      "\"China will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\" the ministry said.",
      "The agreement follows initial talks in Geneva in early May that led both sides to postpone massive tariff hikes that were threatening to freeze much trade between the two countries. Later talks in London set a framework for negotiations and the deal mentioned by Mr. Trump appeared to formalize that agreement.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Thursday that the Trump administration and China had \"agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.\"",
      "That clarification came after the Trump announcement of a \"deal\" at the White House event, at which he urged Republican lawmakers to approve the mammoth tax and budget bill before Congress.",
      "China hasn't announced any new agreements, but said earlier this week that it was speeding up approvals of exports of rare earths. Beijing's limits on rare earths exports have been a key point of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing was accelerating review of export license applications for rare earths and had approved \"a certain number of compliant applications.\"",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington after China imposed permit requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Fentanyl another key in the trade talks",
      "China also has taken steps recently on the fentanyl issue, announcing last week that it would designate two more substances as precursor chemicals for fentanyl, making them subject to production, transport and export regulations. Mr. Trump has demanded that Beijing do more to stop the flow of such precursor ingredients to Mexican drug cartels, which use them to make fentanyl for sale in the U.S. He imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports over the fentanyl issue, the biggest part of current 30% across-the-board taxes on Chinese goods.",
      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Mr. Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",
      "U.S., China economies both feeling trade disputes' effects",
      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Mr. Trump could impose tariffs on them.",
      "In China, factory profits sank more than 9% from a year earlier in May, with automakers suffering a large share of that drop. They fell more than 1% year-on-year in January-May.",
      "Mr. Trump and other U.S. officials have indicated they expect to reach trade deals with many other countries, including India.",
      "\"We're going to have deal after deal after deal,\" Lutnick said.",

      "The S&P 500 has jumped 23% since closing at its 2025 low on April 8. On Thursday, it closed up 9 points, or 0.8%, to 6,141, just three points shy of its record closing high of 6,144 on February 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also flirted with its previous record of 20,174, set in December 2024, inching up 195 points, or 1%, on Thursday to close at 20,167.",
      "The market could surpass those previous records on Friday or early next week, analysts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Wall Street has largely shrugged off concerns about tariffs and geopolitical tensions since early April, although there have been periods of volatility along the way. While these issues continue to pose risks to the U.S. economy, many investors are confident they'll skirt any major market downturns, at least in the short-term, experts say.",
      "\"We hear all those narratives of what could go wrong, or what is going wrong,\" said Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro. \"But the market doesn't seem to care. It's looking forward. It's plowing ahead, and it's been trading really well.\"",
      "Still, Wall Street is awaiting more news on Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs slated to end on July 9. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that tariffs are likely to drive up inflation later this year, slowing economic growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why experts say the market is rebounding.",
      "Easing concerns about tariffs",
      "Since April, the markets have whipsawed in response to the Trump administration's on-again, off-again tariff policies.",
      "While uncertainty around the impact of the levies remains, analysts say investor concern has faded as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase after the Trump administration\u00a0struck a deal with China earlier this month.",
      "\"We've gone into a period where we haven't had a lot of disruptive noise coming either out of Washington or among our trading partners,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"I think that's helped to sort of cool anxieties, at least for the time being.\"",
      "The next benchmark will be July 9, when the president's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs comes to an end. If the U.S. slips back into a more intense trade situation, the markets could show more volatility, Kenwell said.",
      "So far, data suggests a resilient economy, although some Wall Street economists have warned the economy may soon face headwinds.",
      "A\u00a0report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute released Thursday predicts that the brunt of the tariffs impact will hit in the third quarter. The analysis also warns the tariffs could leave the U.S. with \"historically high and potentially debilitating levies.\"",
      "Optimism about tech stocks",
      "Technology stocks, dominated by the so-called \"magnificent 7\" \u2014 consisting of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and other tech giants\u2014 have been integral in driving the market rebound, analysts say.",
      "Tech has become the best performing sector so far in the second quarter, a period which spans April through June. Financial companies such as banks and insurance firms have also been performing well, he added. According to Kenwell, those two sectors alone represent over 40% of the S&P 500.",
      "Chip company Nvidia closed at a record high on Thursday, allowing the company to retake its crown as the world's most valuable company. The tech giant's stock has soared almost 62% since the market's 2025 bottom on April 8.",
      "AI-powered companies have gained momentum in recent weeks, with Micron Technology, which sells computer memory and data storage, beating earnings expectations for the latest quarter, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli pointed out.",
      "Investors have gravitated towards tech stocks, Luschini said, given their high free cash flow and potential for strong earnings growth.",
      "\"I think investors are looking at them as sort of a bastion of safety,\" he said.",
      "Signs of a potential rate cut",
      "Investors have been buoyed by forecasts for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.",
      "At the Fed's June meeting, the central bank said it would\u00a0hold rates steady but pencilled in two cuts for the remainder of the year. A rate cut could come as soon as the next meeting, July 29-30, but it's more likely it will happen during the September meeting, experts say.",
      "\"I think investors are kind of looking through the next several months to a period in which we're likely to see more accommodative monetary policy,\" said Luschini.",

      "Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.",
      "Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. \"It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,\" she said.",
      "In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn't worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.",
      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.

      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",

      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",

      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nestle announced on Wednesday that it will eliminate artificial colors from its U.S. food and beverages by mid-2026.",
      "It's the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \"not recommended for human consumption\" in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Trump took office, U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of its potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday that it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn't contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it wants to evolve with its U.S. customers' changing nutritional needs and preferences. \"We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers. As their diverse dietary preferences and nutritional needs evolve, we evolve with them,\" Nestle's U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement.",

      "The FTC reached a separate agreement last year under which Epic was fined $275 million over allegations it violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule.",
      "How can I apply for a refund?",

Previously, consumers had until February 14 to file a claim, but the FTC has now extended that deadline to July 9. If you already filed a claim after February 14, no further action is required.",

      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

      "A poll by Bankrate found that nearly half of respondents think they need to early at least $100,00 a year to live comfortably, while a quarter said they need to make at least $150,000. To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",
      "Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"Times have shifted,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. \"Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury.\"",
      "As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures. If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4%, up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate.",
      "According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more.",
      "By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure.",
      "Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roadless-rule-national-forests-logging-reversal/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 07:46:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\" Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home of the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Mr. Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Mr. Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The Tongass is a temperate rainforest of glaciers and rugged coastal islands. It provides habitat to wildlife such as bears, wolves, salmon and bald eagles.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",

      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro.

      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests.

    "summary": "Republicans are scrambling to meet their goal of sending President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" to his desk within the next week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' goal of sending President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" to his desk within the next week appears to be on shaky ground as the legislation runs into obstacles in the Senate, with changes that risk bleeding GOP support in the House.",
      "A day after Mr. Trump hosted an event at the White House to pressure lawmakers to pass the bill that includes tax cuts and funding for his border and national security priorities, the president signaled he's open to Republicans' self-imposed deadline slipping past July 4.",
      "\"It's important, it's not the end-all,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday about the deadline. \"We'd like to get it done by that time, if possible.\"",
      "Later in the day, Mr. Trump changed the goal posts again, posting on Truth Social that it \"must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also acknowledged the date may slide past the holiday, but said \"I don't want to even accept that as an option right now.\"",
      "\"We'll see,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota, said Friday afternoon when asked if Mr. Trump's initial comments on the timeline bought him more time to get the package through the Senate.",
      "Senators expect to begin voting on the bill Saturday, but have yet to release the final legislative text. The parliamentarian is continuing to determine which provisions comport with the rules governing the reconciliation process that allow Republicans to pass it with a simple majority.",
      "\"That's aspirational,\" Thune said about holding the first test vote midday Saturday, noting that they are still waiting on the parliamentarian to advise on a number of issues.",
      "The Senate leader also wasn't certain whether he had the votes to advance the legislation.",
      "\"We'll find out tomorrow,\" Thune said.",
      "House Democratic leadership issued guidance to members that votes are not expected over the weekend in the lower chamber and members would receive 48 hours notice before any potential votes next week.",
      "\"We can't make any of these final decisions until we see their bill,\" said Johnson. \"I'm going to give all of my members plenty of time to digest that. The House will not be jammed by anything. I made that commitment.\"",
      "Johnson said members would have 72 hours to review the legislation before a vote.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian's guidance has delivered several blows to key GOP provisions, including an effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from receiving Medicaid benefits and a plan to lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs.",
      "Republicans have already struggled to reach a consensus on the provider tax as a handful of senators have expressed concern about the effects it could have on rural hospitals.",
      "Other recent ruled-out provisions include rolling back regulations on gun silencers, a religious carveout from an expansion of the college endowment tax, a $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "But Republicans can rework provisions that violate the rules and go back to the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, with revised language.",
      "One such provision that received a green light from MacDonough was a revised plan to push some of the costs of food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto states. The benefits are currently funded by the federal government. The revision gives states more flexibility in calculating what their cost share requirement will be beginning in 2028.",
      "The parliamentarian also approved a revision on a proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, House Republicans have drawn red lines on issues including the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and clean energy tax credits. Blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support for the bill before it passed the House in May if the SALT cap was not increased from $10,000. They ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000.",
      "Johnson said he believed the blue-state Republicans would ultimately get on board with a proposal that would set the cap at $40,000 for five years and then revert back to $10,000.",
      "Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York said Friday he hasn't \"seen a deal to which I can say yes.\"",
      "Nikole  Killion, \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Jaala  Brown, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                      Ellis  Kim\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group of parents who wanted to opt their children out of instruction with storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",
      "Both the majority and dissenting opinions included pages from the storybooks, though the justices disagreed as to their messages.",
      "Alito wrote that the books \"unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint about same-sex marriage and gender,\" and are \"designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\"",
      "But in Sotomayor's view, the books introduce readers to LGBTQ characters, but drawn on common themes presented to children in other works, such as overcoming difficulties, celebrating milestones or fairytale romances.",
      "The school board adopted the lessons in 2022 and allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the picture books. But in March 2023, it ended the policy and said families would no longer receive advance notice of when the books would be read, and would not be able to have their children excused from the instruction.",
      "The Board of Education had said that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" since some schools had high numbers of absences. It said all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers had to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, though, sparked backlash throughout the community, with more than 1,000 parents signing a petition that called on the board to restore the opt-outs and dozens appearing at board meetings.",
      "Three Montgomery County families filed a lawsuit against the education board over the decision to end the opt-outs, arguing it violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families are a diverse coalition of religions \u2014 Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox.",
      "A federal district court in Maryland and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled for the school board, finding that there was no evidence that the families were compelled to violate their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in late April.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine is forcing a vote on a resolution he introduced days before the U.S. bombed Iran.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is expected to vote Friday on whether to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran, as Democratic anger festers over the lack of details from the administration about the recent strikes on the country's nuclear facilities.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia introduced the war powers resolution days before the U.S. bombed three locations central to Iran's nuclear program, seeking to force the president to get congressional authorization before entering the conflict between Israel and Iran.",
      "Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, told reporters Thursday a vote is planned for Friday. The measure needs 51 votes to pass, a heavy lift given Republicans' 53-47 Senate majority.",
      "Since the measure was introduced, Mr. Trump announced a ceasefire between the adversaries and declared that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated\" during the 12-day war. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he would \"without question\" consider bombing Iran again if Tehran was enriching uranium to a level that concerned the U.S.",
      "But anger from Democrats, including those who have said that Iran should never be able to obtain a nuclear weapon, has simmered as they say they have been left in the dark about U.S. military actions.",
      "It's led some Democrats to question whether the Trump administration is misleading the public about the strikes, especially after an initial classified assessment found that they set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Top intelligence officials said Wednesday that new intelligence showed the nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" and its facilities \"destroyed.\" It would take the Iranians \"years\" to rebuild the facilities, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called it \"an historically successful attack\" in a contentious press briefing Thursday.",
      "Classified briefings for the Senate and House were originally scheduled for Tuesday, the same day the initial assessment was leaked. Officials briefed senators on Thursday afternoon and House members on Friday.",
      "A White House official said Tuesday the Senate briefing was postponed because of \"evolved circumstances as a result of recent positive developments in the Middle East.\"",
      "After the briefings, some Democrats cast doubt on the administration's characterization of the strikes and questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said the information disclosed in the briefing was \"massively different than what has been told to Congress over the last year, up until a month ago, about both Iranian capabilities and Iranian intent.\"",
      "Crow said he was \"not convinced of that whatsoever\" when asked whether Iranian nuclear facilities had been obliterated.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has railed against a lack of transparency and said earlier this week the administration had not presented Congress with any evidence that Iran posed an imminent threat requiring immediate military action.",
      "But Jeffries did not go as far as supporting a resolution to impeach Mr. Trump over the bombings. He and more than 120 Democrats voted with all Republicans to kill the measure, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas, on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also questioned the timing of the strikes.",
      "\"It's pretty clear that there was no imminent threat to the United States,\" Himes said. \"There's always an Iranian threat to the world. But ... I have not seen anything to suggest that the threat from the Iranians was radically different last Saturday than it was two Saturdays ago.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution is one of a handful of similar efforts seeking to curtail further U.S. involvement in Iran, though it's unclear whether any will be successful in a Congress controlled narrowly by Republicans.",
      "Some Republicans who were supportive of the resolutions, like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, appear to be backing away from forcing a vote as long as the ceasefire holds and the U.S. does not conduct any further bombings. And House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, called the efforts irrelevant because Iran and Israel agreed to stop the fighting.",
      "\"It's kind of a moot point now, isn't it?\" Johnson said Monday. \"It seems rather silly at this point and I hope they'll acknowledge it as such and put it to bed because it has zero chance of passing anyway.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal this week he believes Mr. Trump acted \"perfectly within his authority\" by striking Iran, and he hopes the war powers resolution will be defeated.",
      "\"I don't think there's any question the president has the authority legally and constitutionally to do what he did,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"There are always questions around these things, but past presidents and both political parties have similarly acted in circumstances where there've been airstrikes at various places around the world where our national security interests dictated it.\"",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, and most major military conflicts in recent history have been launched under an authorization for the use of military force passed by Congress. But presidents have periodically acted without explicit permission from lawmakers, including during President Bill Clinton's 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia and President Barack Obama's 2011 airstrikes on Libya, the Congressional Research Service notes.",
      "In an interview last week with CBS News' Major Garrett, Kaine acknowledged that his resolution could fail but said he wanted his colleagues to be on the record about U.S. involvement in another war.",
      "\"Everyone in the Senate should agree that this is a matter of such gravity and importance that we shouldn't allow war to begin without Congress having a debate in full view of the American public and members of the Senate and House having to go on the record about it,\" he said.",

      "As the Senate aims to vote on President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill ahead of the president's July 4 deadline, some advocates \u2014 including relatives of people killed in the American Airlines crash \u2014 say the current funding in the mega-bill is just the beginning of what is needed to overhaul the antiquated airspace system.",
      "\"We are very aware that [the funding] is a down payment only,\" Amy Hunter, cousin to Peter Livingston, who died in the Jan. 29 crash alongside his wife and two daughters, told CBS News. A total of 67 people died in the collision over the Potomac River, including American Airlines passengers and crew as well as the Black Hawk crew members.",
      "\"We have been assured that they understand, and the administration understands, that it has to be followed up basically immediately with the completion of funding for this project,\" Hunter said.",
      "As it stands, the Senate's version of the legislation \u2014 known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 dedicates $12.5 billion to modernizing the air traffic control system. A version passed by the House last month also allocated $12.5 billion to transition from copper wires to fiber optics, buy new radios and build new radar systems in air traffic control facilities nationwide.",
      "This funding is just a fraction of what experts say is needed to completely overhaul the antiquated national airspace system. A coalition of industry groups and airlines has said at least $31 billion is needed for the overhaul.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been clear-eyed that completely overhauling the national airspace system will require more funding.",
      "\"So $12.5 billion is really important. That gives us a start to build this project, which is why I aggressively support the big beautiful Bill. But it's not enough. Again, we need more money,\" Duffy said in a May press conference.",
      "The administration's plans to completely rebuild the air traffic control system include replacing outdated communication technologies, installing new software systems and building six new air traffic control centers for the first time since the 1960s.",
      "The White House has not provided a price tag for what the overhaul would cost, but said they hope to complete the project within four years.",
      "But for the families of AA5342 victims, more action is needed to address the nation's air traffic control system, particularly in the crowded airspace around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where a National Transportation Safety Board review found there were over 15,214 close calls between 2011 and 2024.",
      "The advocates have called for an independent safety review of that airspace, which can be enacted by Congress or asked for by Duffy.",
      "Additionally, several family members of victims told CBS News the Army has not spoken with their family about the crash, which was the deadliest airline accident in the U.S. since November 2001. CBS News has reached out to the Army for comment, but has not received a response.",
      "\"We are grieving families and we are advocates, but we are Americans. We benefit from a strong prepared military and that's what we want to make sure of,\" Rachel Feres, another cousin of the Livingston family, said.",
      "Families say they aren't looking for blame and want to look forward, but they feel that they shouldn't be the only advocates for making the nation's skies safer.",
      "\"We know it's a very long path. For clarity, we think that it shouldn't be a requirement that the families are involved. We should be able to grieve in private,\"\u00a0 Hunter said. \"That is not a reality of today.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported back to his home country and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution, may remain in federal custody, after his lawyers and prosecutors sparred over whether he would be deported immediately upon his release while awaiting a criminal trial.",
      "His lawyers asked that a magistrate judge's order granting him pretrial release not be issued until July 16, when he is scheduled to appear in court again for another hearing. In a filing Friday, prosecutors agreed to the delay. The court must still approve the request.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in a filing with the court that the Justice Department has been giving conflicting statements as to whether the Trump administration will move to deport him before he stands trial.",
      "They said that \"because we cannot put any faith in any representation made on this issue by the DOJ, we respectfully request to delay the issuance of the release order until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation.\"",
      "\"A short delay will prevent the government from removing Mr. Abrego and allow time for the government to provide reliable information concerning its intentions,\" the lawyers wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia is to be tried on human smuggling charges, but the Trump administration had said that if he were to be released pending trial, he would swiftly be taken into custody by immigration authorities and deported.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors signaled Thursday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would detain and move to deport Abrego Garcia to a third-country \u2014 one that is not his country of origin, El Salvador \u2014 if he were to be released from criminal custody, as was expected. But a Justice Department spokesperson then suggested Abrego Garcia would not be deported until after his criminal trial concludes.",
      "In announcing that Abrego Garcia had been indicted earlier this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi said if he is convicted on the smuggling charges, Abrego Garcia would be returned to El Salvador after completing his sentence.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two counts arising out of what federal prosecutors said was his participation in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle migrants into the U.S. unlawfully. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at a hearing earlier this month.",
      "Abrego Garcia was ordered released by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes after she denied a Justice Department request to keep him detained while awaiting a criminal trial. The Justice Department appealed Holmes' order, but a federal district judge on Wednesday declined to pause her decision. Holmes said earlier this week that Abrego Garcia would remain in U.S. Marshal custody until at least Friday while his lawyers and prosecutors submitted additional filings on his conditions for release.",

    "story": [
      "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan was placed in expedited removal in San Diego on Thursday, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News. Sayed Naser was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers two weeks earlier when he appeared at the San Diego federal courthouse for his mandatory immigration hearing.",
      "\"DHS elected to exercise its broad discretion to dismiss removal proceedings and instead place the respondent in expedited removal within two years of his entry date,\" says the order signed by Judge Catherin Halliday-Roberts.",
      "Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies, criticized the ruling, saying, \"A bureaucratic technically just stripped a wartime ally of his legal protections and fast-tracked him for deportation.\"",
      "\"Sayed stood with U.S. forces in combat. Now he faces removal without a lawyer, without a hearing and possibly without a country. This isn't just cruel, it's cowardly,\" VanDiver said.",
      "Since his arrest, Naser \u2014 whose full name is being withheld because of safety concerns \u2014 has been held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick.",
      "Naser will soon participate in a \"credible threat\" interview over the phone with an officer from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, without his lawyer, but it is not clear from the order when the interview will take place. If he can demonstrate that he would face significant harm in his home country, he will be allowed to apply for asylum.",
      "If he does not pass his credible fear interview, he will be deported to an unknown destination including a potential third-party country, says McGoldrick.",
      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the courthouse on June 12.",
      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",
      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to immigration case files reviewed by CBS News. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said\u00a0 VanDiver. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS said Naser \"entered the U.S. unvetted via the CBP One app under the previous administration in 2024. There is nothing in his immigration records indicating that he assisted the U.S. government in any capacity. All of his claims will be heard by a judge. Any Afghan who fears persecution is able to request asylum.\"",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump praised the Supreme Court for its decision Friday limiting the ability of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, calling it a \"monumental victory for the Constitution.\"",
      "In comments at the White House, the president said, \"This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch.\"",

In a\u00a06-3 decision\u00a0that stemmed from the president's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court said universal injunction orders likely exceeded the authority Congress has given the federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump called the use of nationwide injunctions \"a grave threat to democracy, frankly.\"",
      "Thanks to this decision, the president said the administration can \"now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,\" including his effort to end birthright citizenship. Attorney General Pam Bondi predicted the Supreme Court would \"most likely\" rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship case during the next Supreme Court term, which begins this fall.",
      "Mr. Trump repeated a statement he often makes about birthright citizenship, a provision of the 14th Amendment, saying that it's no longer being used as it was originally intended. \"Hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship, and it wasn't meant for that reason,\" he said. \"It was meant for the babies of slaves.\"",
      "The president thanked Barrett for writing the opinion \"brilliantly,\" and also the justices who sided with her.",
      "In the dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates. Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship,\" and the court's ruling means that \"absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also applauded other Supreme Court rulings, including a decision Friday to allow parents in a Maryland school district to opt their children out of storybooks based on objections to their approach to gender and sexuality.",
      "\"I think the ruling was a great ruling, and I think it's a great ruling for parents,\" the president said.",
      "The president addressed other topics beyond the Supreme Court rulings, too, including his administration's tariffs and his trade negotiations with other countries. Although the president indicated his administration is close to deals with several countries, he said at some point in the next week and a half, his administration will be sending letters to some countries \"and tell them what they have to pay.\"",
      "On Iran, the president expressed support for any new agreement with Iran, including a provision that the International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 or \"somebody\" approved by the U.S. \u2014 act as an independent inspector to examine Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "One reporter asked the president if he would consider bombing Iran again, if U.S. intelligence shows the country can still enrich uranium to a level that concerns him.",

      "The Trump administration will revoke the legal status and work permits of hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants in early September, arguing that conditions in Haiti have sufficiently improved for them to return home, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said it would terminate Haiti's longstanding Temporary Protected Status program, which has allowed immigrants from the crisis-stricken Caribbean nation to live and work in the U.S. legally since 2010, following the devastating earthquake that year.",
      "If they don't qualify for another legal immigration status \u2014 like asylum or a green card \u2014 those who lose their TPS protections will become ineligible to work in the U.S. legally and eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday urged Haitians with TPS to voluntarily leave the U.S. by using a smartphone app that officials have converted into a system to facilitate self-deportations. The administration has warned immigrants in the U.S. illegally that if they don't self-deport, they will be found, arrested and forcibly deported.",
      "\"This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,\" DHS said in a statement. \"The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.\"",
      "As of late last year, more than a quarter of a million Haitians \u2014 260,790 \u2014 had been approved for TPS, according to government data compiled by Congress' research unit. DHS said their TPS protections would lapse on Sept. 2.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the federal government to offer migrants work permits and a reprieve from deportation if their home countries are engulfed in a crisis, such as a war or an environmental disaster.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's assertions on Friday, the U.S. government has described Haiti as a country with deep political instability and plagued by gang violence and widespread poverty. In fact, the State Department instructs Americans not to visit Haiti in a Level 4 travel advisory, warning them about the threat of \"robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "The Biden administration vastly expanded the TPS program for Haitians, allowing many of those who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 illegally and legally \u2014 to qualify for the initiative. It also used TPS at an unprecedented scale to offer legal status to hundreds of thousands migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Venezuela, Ukraine and other nations.",
      "But President Trump's administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, as part of its efforts to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, officials have announced plans to terminate TPS protections for Afghans, Cameronians and Venezuelans. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed the administration to end the work permits and deportation protections of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans TPS recipients.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that was approved by the state's GOP-led legislature and created a second majority-Black district.",
      "An order from the court issued on the last day of its term restored the case to its calendar for reargument, with an additional scheduling order to come. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the move to order more arguments and said the court should have decided the case.",
      "The move means the state's map with two majority-Black districts remains intact for now.",
      "The district lines at the center of the dispute were invalidated in 2022 by a three-judge lower court panel, which sided with a group of self-described \"non-African-American voters\" who had challenged the House map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The map wasn't the first crafted by the state's Republican-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census. Instead, Louisiana's efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.",
      "The case demonstrated the challenges state lawmakers face when trying to balance complying with the Voting Rights Act without relying too much on race during the drawing the political lines, which can run afoul of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court's decision is also likely to have implications for the balance of power in the House in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to hold onto their razor-thin majority.",
      "The legal wrangling over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned several years and began after the state legislature redrew the six House districts in early 2022. A federal judge in Baton Rouge ruled that year that the map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it diluted Black voting strength, and ordered the state to put a remedial plan in place that had two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "That initial map had one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts, even though African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The new map adopted by the state legislature reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state lawmakers said. But they said they also had a second goal: to protect powerful Republican incumbents in the House, namely Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow. Letlow is the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, state officials noted.",
      "The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge in the southeast, connecting predominantly Black communities along the way.",
      "But after the new voting lines were adopted, 12 \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged the reconfigured District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel sitting in Shreveport agreed and said the legislature relied too much on race when it drew the new House district lines. Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups \u2014 who were on opposing sides in the challenge to the original map \u2014 to ask the Supreme Court to let the state use the new congressional map for the 2024 elections.",
      "The high court granted their request for emergency relief, and in November, Louisiana voters sent two Black Democrats to Congress. The Supreme Court then agreed to take up the case.",
      "The redistricting dispute is one of several the high court has been confronted with in recent years, and more continue to make their way to the justices. In a landmark 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, which required certain states and localities with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices to receive Justice Department approval before changing their election rules.",
      "Then, in 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have a role to play in deciding legal fights over partisan gerrymandering, when state's voting lines are drawn to entrench the political party in power.",
      "But in an unexpected ruling in 2023, the Supreme Court declined an invitation to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Instead, the high court invalidated Alabama's congressional map crafted after the 2020 Census, which ultimately led to the election of the state's second Black House member.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday limited the use of nationwide injunctions, reining in federal judges' ability to issue sweeping orders that have in recent years stymied implementation of policies from Republican and Democratic presidential administrations alike.",
      "In a widely anticipated decision stemming from President Trump's executive order seeking to end\u00a0birthright citizenship, the high court said that universal orders likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to the federal courts. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with the liberal justices in dissent.",
      "The court granted the Trump administration request to narrow the reach of the injunctions blocking the president's executive order while proceedings move forward, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief\" to plaintiffs who can sue, Barrett wrote. The justices did not address the question of whether Mr. Trump's order is constitutional, and the administration has said agencies have 30 days to issue public guidance about implementation of the policy, allowing time for more challenges to be filed.",
      "\"Some say that the universal injunction 'give[s] the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch.' But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,\" Barrett wrote. \"When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.\"",
      "In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the majority of abdicating its role in protecting the rule of law. She read portions of her dissenting opinion from the bench.",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the president has made a 'solemn mockery' of our Constitution,\" she wrote. \"Rather than stand firm, the court gives way.\"",
      "At a White House news conference following the decision, Mr. Trump praised it as \"a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Universal injunctions and the birthright citizenship case",
      "The court's ruling came in a trio of emergency appeals by the Trump administration arising out of the president's executive order seeking to end the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, which means that everyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to narrow the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's policy nationwide while legal challenges brought by 22 states, immigrants' rights groups and seven individuals moved forward.",
      "But instead of swiftly deciding whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief, the Supreme Court held arguments on whether to restrict the use of nationwide, or universal, injunctions, which are judicial orders that prevent the government from enforcing a policy anywhere in the country and against anyone, including individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship has become intertwined with the administration's battle against nationwide injunctions. These sweeping orders have frustrated both Democratic and Republican presidents seeking to implement their agendas among gridlock in Congress, and the fight over them has been simmering for several years.",
      "The Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued during Mr. Trump's first term and 28 granted while former President Joe Biden was in office. In Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service found 17 nationwide injunctions were issued during the first 100 days, though the Trump administration estimated last month there have been far more \u2014 at least 40 of these orders, and most coming from the same five judicial districts.",
      "Some of the justices have suggested in past writings that the Supreme Court would have to clarify whether nationwide injunctions are allowed at all, and members on both ideological sides of the bench have been critical of them. The president and his allies have\u00a0attacked judges\u00a0for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for\u00a0some to be impeached.",
      "The president's birthright citizenship order was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office. While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident. The president directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children in those categories born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-a-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the order. Federal appeals courts in California, Massachusetts and Virginia then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the cases. The administration said the Supreme Court should, at a minimum, allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance while proceedings continue, and took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts. Government lawyers said in a filing that universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "But the plaintiffs in the cases urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders in place. In a filing\u00a0of their own, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" since it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.\"",
      "The states argued that the Trump administration seeks to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "The court's decision",
      "Writing for the majority, Barrett looked to the nation's history and said that nationwide injunctions were \"conspicuously nonexistent\" in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. If federal courts had such a tool, she said, \"surely they would not have let it lay idle.\"",
      "\"Nothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a century thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal courts lack authority to issue them,\" she wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor warned that the Supreme Court's new regime puts all manner of constitutional rights at risk and renders them \"meaningful in name only\" for people who are not parties to a lawsuit.",
      "\"Today, the threat is birthright citizenship,\" she wrote. \"Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the court's conservative majority of ignoring whether Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship is constitutional and said its \"patent unlawfulness\" underscores why universal injunctions are appropriate remedies.",
      "While the high court agreed to grant Mr. Trump's request for a partial stay of the injunctions, Barrett wrote that there are still issues for the lower courts to decide, including whether narrower relief is appropriate.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision still allows plaintiffs challenging a policy to file class-action lawsuits and seek certification of a nationwide class. In her dissent, Sotomayor urged individuals who may be impacted by Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship plan, as well as lower courts, to move swiftly.",
      "\"[T]he parents of children covered by the Citizenship Order would be well advised to file promptly class-action suits and to request temporary injunctive relief for the putative class pending class certification,\" she wrote. \"For suits challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order, moreover, lower courts would be wise to act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court's prompt review.\"",
      "On the heels of the Supreme Court's decision, CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, asked the federal district court to allow its lawsuit to proceed on a classwide basis and certify as a class \"all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.\"",

    "summary": "Nineteen states have approved measures that require pornography websites to ensure that visitors are at least 18 years old.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Texas law that requires pornography websites to verify their visitors' age, finding that the lower court applied the appropriate level of judicial review when evaluating the constitutionality of the age-verification laws.",
      "The high court divided 6-3 along ideological lines, with Justice Clarence Thomas authoring the decision for the majority. The Supreme Court said that the law survives a more heightened form of judicial scrutiny.",
      "\"We granted certiorari to decide whether these burdens likely render [Texas law] H. B. 1181 unconstitutional under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. We hold that they do not,\" Thomas wrote. \"The power to require age verification is within a State's authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content,\" he continued, saying Texas' law \"is a constitutionally permissible exercise of that authority.\"",
      "\"The statute does not ban adults from accessing this material; it simply requires them to verify their age before accessing it on a covered website,\" Thomas noted.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the dissenting opinion that while \"everyone agrees that shielding children from exposure to the sexually explicit speech H. B. 1181 targets is a compelling state interest,\" the Texas law should be subject to the most stringent standard of judicial review, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' ability to view constitutionally protected speech based on its content.",
      "\"That is what foundational First Amendment principles demand,\" Kagan concluded.",
      "While the law at issue in the case was passed in Texas, 18 other states have approved similar measures that require pornography websites to ensure that visitors are at least 18 years old. Challengers to the Texas law \u2014 a group of companies that operate covered websites and a trade group called the Free Speech Coalition \u2014 have argued that it violates the First Amendment by burdening adults' access to protected speech.",
      "Under the Texas law, enacted in 2023, entities must comply if more than one-third of their web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Companies subject to its requirements have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "In response to the challenge to the law brought by the Free Speech Coalition and website operators, a federal district court judge agreed to block enforcement of the age-verification requirement. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit froze that decision, which allowed the law to take effect. The Supreme Court last year allowed Texas to continue enforcing the age-verification measure while it weighed the case, known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton.",
      "The key question before the high court was whether the 5th Circuit applied the correct standard of review when it evaluated the age-verification law. The appeals court applied the most deferential level of review, rational basis, and found that the requirement satisfied it. But the plaintiffs in the case and the Biden administration said the appeals court was wrong to apply that standard and should have instead analyzed it under the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because the law impedes adults' access to speech protected by the Constitution.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under strict scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",

      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 during President Joe Biden's term. In Friday's social media video, Hegseth said that the ship's name change was made in line with \"taking the politics out of ship naming.\"",

      "William F. Buckley (1925-2008), founder of the National Review and host of the TV debate show \"Firing Line,\" was a leading political commentator who catalyzed America's conservative movement with his support of such figures as Joseph McCarthy, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.",
      "In his new biography, \"Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America\" (published by Random House), historian Sam Tanenhaus (author of books on Whittaker Chambers and Louis Armstrong) writes about the life and influence of Buckley, whose drive to push America to the right would alter the Republican Party and lead to the rise of Donald Trump.",

      "Connecticut Yanquis",
      "William F. Buckley, Jr., the intellectual leader of the modern conservative movement, rightly saw himself less as founder than heir. Everything he learned, and all he became, began at home.",
      "It started with his father, William F. Buckley, Sr., a lawyer, real estate investor, and oil speculator who grew up in the brush country, the scrubland frontier, of Duval County in South Texas. He was thirty-five and had made his first fortune when, on a visit to New Orleans, he met twenty-two-year-old Aloise Steiner, the eldest of three sisters of Swiss and German background\u2014\"the very essence of old New Orleans charm,\" said one of the many men smitten by her. She had a year or two of college, played Mozart on the piano, and told captivating if not always quite credible stories\u2014for instance, of the fourteen marriage proposals she claimed to have turned down before W.F. Buckley began courting her in the spring of 1917.",
      "The physical attraction was immediate, almost electric. Many years later the couple's children remembered the \"frisson\" that connected their parents. The couple also shared a deep and abiding Catholic faith. After the wedding ceremony at the Steiner family's parish church, Mater Dolorosa on South Carrollton Avenue, on December 29, 1917, the Buckleys began their married life in Mexico. W.F. Buckley had been living there since 1908. He had apartments and law offices in Mexico City as well as in Tampico\u2014the oil boomtown on the Gulf where, after building a prosperous law practice writing oil leases, he had gone into real estate and then into oil, borrowing substantial sums to sink five wells on the banks of the Panuco River.",
      "Oil speculation was always a high-risk venture, but especially in Mexico. It was in the throes of the twentieth century's first great revolution, its ten-year-long \"bloody fiesta,\"\u2009which ended in 1920 with the rout of the right-wing faction Buckley had supported and the election of a new president he despised. It was a stinging defeat, and he would never get over it. Yet he also could say, and often did\u2014to his children most emphatically\u2014that although he had lost, he had done so on his terms, without giving an inch to the opposition. Other oilmen, including some far wealthier and more powerful than he, had submitted to the new order and made lucrative deals with each fresh regime. W.F. Buckley refused to do it. He left Mexico\u2014in fact was expelled by order of its government\u2014with debts totaling one million dollars. In later years he showed his children a treasured souvenir from those times, an architect's sketch of the grand palacio, with private chapel, which W.F. Buckley had planned to build on substantial property he had purchased in Coyoacan.",
      "Bankrupt at age forty, Buckley would have to start all over. He had a family to support, his wife and three small children, now living with his mother and two sisters in Austin, Texas. But there was a new opportunity. In fact, having to put Mexico behind him might be for the best. The oil fields in its Golden Lane were nearly tapped out. The great new oil patch was in Venezuela. Once again there were large profits to be made but also many hazards\u2014in this case \"hostile Indian tribes,\" as well as malaria and fatal \"liver and intestinal disorders.\" Visitors were advised to stay no longer than a few weeks.",
      "For W.F. Buckley admonitions were a goad. He went to Venezuela, stayed a full six months, and came back in 1924 with leasing rights to three million acres surrounding Lake Maracaibo, spreading east and west, a complexly organized checker-board whose squares \"in practically every instance adjoin properties that are being actively developed by major American oil companies,\" it was reported at the time. The concession was \"rated among the most valuable in Venezuela.\"",
      "Buckley, now based in New York, formed a new company, Pantepec (named for a river in Mexico), and with the sponsorship of the Wall Street broker Edward A. Pierce floated stock shares and secured investments from two California majors: Union Oil and California Petroleum. Matching wits against some of the finest legal minds in the United States, W.F. Buckley worked out the terms for an innovative \"farm-out.\" In return for gaining temporary control of a third of the holdings, the two behemoths would cover the costs of exploration and drilling and reap most of the profits once oil was struck. W.F. Buckley would be allotted a tiny fraction of those profits, and he now had funds to send teams of engineers and geologists to explore the remaining two million acres.",
      "Remade as a Wall Street speculator, W.F. Buckley bought a suite of offices on lower Park Avenue and furnished them sumptuously, the better to impress investors. He also bought an apartment building nearby where he stayed alone during the week. Jazz Age Manhattan, with its speakeasies and fleshpots and lurking criminal element, was no place for his wife and growing family. They lived on his third shrewd purchase, a large estate in the rural northwest corner of Connecticut.",
      "On Fridays, the work week finished, W.F. Buckley walked a few blocks uptown from his office to Grand Central and rode the train home to his family, three full hours through exurban New York\u2014Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties\u2014all the way to Amenia, where a Buick sat idling with the Black \"houseboy,\" James Cole of New Orleans, behind the wheel in a chauffeur's cap. Together they drove three miles along a country road and, if daylight remained, enjoyed the vista\u2014the wooded Litchfield Hills and the dipping valley, the bright quilt of dairy farms\u2014and then crossed the Connecticut state line at Sharon, a picturesque village of fifteen hundred, incorporated in 1739 and named for the fertile Biblical plain. A favorite weekend and summer getaway for wealthy New Yorkers, Sharon was famous for its narrow elongated green, originally grazing land, which gracefully stretched for more than a mile from its north end\u2014with storefronts and wooden walkways where in summer elms arched overhead, the branches on either side touching to form a canopy\u2014to South Main Street. There, near the town hall and the Hotchkiss Library, stood what is still today Sharon's chief landmark: a granite-and-brownstone clock tower, forty feet high with a pyramid roof, built in the 1880s by the same firm that designed Theodore Roosevelt's Sagamore Hill estate on Oyster Bay, Long Island.",
      "On either side of South Main, set back from the street, were large and imposing manor houses. The Buckleys lived in one of them, Number 32, called the Ansel Sterling House after its first owner, a lawyer and judge twice elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1820s. Sterling had purchased the property in 1808 and then torn down the original brick, replacing it with a Georgian frame structure. Over time the ten-acre property had tripled to thirty acres, beautiful and lush, with thick stands of oaks and sugar maples, outbuildings including barn, stables, and icehouse, and horse trails that wound through the rolling pastures and up into the gentle hills beyond. Today Ansel Sterling's house still stands, though much enlarged by W.F. Buckley. Its handsome entrance with pediment and pillars stares across Main Street at Sharon's two historic churches: little Christ Church Episcopal, with its witch-hat spire, and the Congregational church, the town's oldest.",
      "In 1923, when W.F. Buckley first toured the property and rented it for the summer, its most striking feature was the elm that towered up from its front lawn. It had been planted in colonial times by Sharon's most illustrious forefather, the Congregational minister Reverend Cotton Mather Smith, a descendant of Cotton Mather. It was now the largest elm in the entire state, its immense trunk measuring eighteen feet around. In 1924, the same year Main Street was paved for motor traffic, Buckley bought the estate outright and renamed it Great Elm.",
      "This was the new life Buckley had conjured in a few short years, seemingly pulled out of thinnest air, for his wife and growing family. So promising did the future look that when a sixth child was born on November 24, 1925, husband and wife agreed that this son, their third, should be his father's namesake: William F. Buckley, Jr.",
      "It was always an event when \"Father\" came home. The children who were not away at school or upstairs in the nursery crowded in front of the house to greet him. \"We'd wait there for his car to come,\" one of his six daughters remembered, \"and make bets on which car would be Father's.\" He was delighted to see them, but even happier to see his wife. \"He'd kiss us all and he'd say, 'Where's your mother?' Mother would come and say, 'Darling,' and the two of them would walk out together.\"",
      "No one felt these currents more keenly than Billy Buckley, who had the middle child's fear of being overlooked, lost in the crowd. And the Buckley siblings really were a crowd: ten in all, many of them very close in age, five born ahead of Billy and four after. With servants added, as well as tutors, workmen, groomsmen for the horses, and later a riding instructor and his family, the household numbered more than twenty and was alive with pranks, schemes, hilarity, and strife.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",
      "The legal battle at the Supreme Court started in 2022 when a group of consumers, a carrier and the nonprofit Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that the fund is unlawful because Congress unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Consumers' Research and found that the combination of Congress' delegation to the FCC, and the commission's subdelegation to the fund administrator violates the Constitution.",
      "The Justice Department under former President Joe Biden asked the Supreme Court to review the 5th Circuit's ruling, and the Trump administration continued to defend the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the structure of a federal health task force that recommends preventive medical services that must be provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court in the case known as Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc. leaves intact the 16-member U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The task force is part of the Department of Health and Human Service and has for decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions.",
      "The court ruled 6-3 in finding that the task force members are inferior officers, whose appointment by the head of Health and Human Services is consistent with the Constitution's Appointments Clause. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored the majority opinion, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch in dissent.",
      "\"[T]he Task Force members' appointments are fully consistent with the Appointments Clause in Article II of the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"The structure of the Task Force and the manner of appointing its officers preserve the chain of political accountability that was central to the Framers' design of the Appointments Clause: The Task Force members were appointed by and are supervised and directed by the Secretary of HHS. And the Secretary of HHS, in turn, answers to the president of the United States.\"",
      "The work of the task force took on added significance after passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The law requires health insurers and group health plans to provide preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "A group of Christian-owned businesses and individuals filed a lawsuit arguing that the preventive-care coverage mandates cannot be enforced because the task force members were unconstitutionally appointed.",
      "The plaintiffs specifically took issue with the task force's recommendation in June 2019 that PrEP, a medication to prevent HIV, be included in the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. They argued that providing no-cost coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Among the other preventive services recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes, and statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",
      "A federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found that the task force's structure is unconstitutional under the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The courts concluded that its members are principal officers and therefore had to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "But the Supreme Court reversed the 5th Circuit's ruling, finding that task force members are \"inferior officers\" since they are \"removable at will by the Secretary of HHS, and their recommendations are reviewable by the Secretary before they take effect.\"",
      "\"So Task Force members are supervised and directed by the Secretary, who in turn answers to the President, preserving the chain of command in Article II,\" Kavanaugh wrote.",
      "The dispute over the task force saw rare agreement between the Biden administration, which appealed the 5th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, and the Trump administration, which continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "But the legal wrangling over the preventive coverage mandates also threatened to put at risk access to preventive care. Nonprofit organizations warned the Supreme Court that eliminating cost-sharing for services like breast cancer screenings or HIV-prevention medications would dissuade patients from seeking medical care.",

    "summary": "President Trump has repeatedly said that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated\" and the program was set back by years.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some Senate Democrats cast doubt on the Trump administration's characterization of the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities after top officials briefed senators Thursday.",
      "In recent days, President Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" after three nuclear sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. Meanwhile, an initial classified assessment found that the strikes set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Democrats questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "\"You cannot bomb knowledge out of existence \u2014 no matter how many scientists you kill,\" Murphy added. \"There are still people in Iran who how to work centrifuges. And if they still have enriched uranium and they still have the ability to use centrifuges, then you're not setting back the program by years. You're setting back the program by months.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that the administration jumped to a conclusion too soon.",
      "\"Listen, I hope that is the final assessment,\" Warner said. \"But if not, does that end up providing a false sense of comfort to the American people?\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he did not receive adequate answers about whether the nuclear stockpile was obliterated.",
      "\"What was clear is that there was no coherent strategy, no end game, no plan, no specific, no detailed plan on how Iran does not attain a nuclear weapon,\" Schumer said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said only a final battle damage assessment confirming the assertions \"would enable us to be comfortable or complacent about what has been done.\"",
      "\"The point is, we don't know. Anybody who says we know with certainty is making it up because we don't have a final battle damage assessment,\" he said. \"I think 'obliterated' is much too strong of word because it implies that it couldn't be reconstituted or somehow it was completely eliminated.\"",
      "Still, Blumenthal praised the military action as \"one that will go down in the annals of military history.\"",
      "\"Certainly, this mission was successful insofar as it extensively destroyed and perhaps severely damaged and set back the Iranian nuclear arms program. But how long and how much really remains to be determined by the intelligence community itself,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina stood behind the administration's characterization, but acknowledged that Iran's capabilities could eventually be restored.",
      "\"The real question is, have we obliterated their desire to have a nuclear weapon,\" Graham said after the classified briefing. \"I don't want people to think that the site wasn't severely damaged or obliterated. It was. But having said that, I don't want people to think the problem is over, because it's not.\"",
      "Graham said he believed the program had been set back by years. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said he was confident \"it's been set way back \u2014 a year, at minimum.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the strikes \"effectively destroyed Iran's nuclear program.\" Cotton added that the initial assessment had several intelligence gaps and \"assumed the worst-case scenario with perfect conditions in Iran.\"",
      "Top intelligence officials said Wednesday that new intelligence showed the nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" and its facilities \"destroyed.\" It would take the Iranians \"years\" to rebuild the facilities, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said.",
      "Ratcliffe was among those who briefed senators Thursday, along with Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.",
      "The briefing had been initially scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed two days, upsetting some Democrats who demanded immediate transparency about the strikes after they were initially left in the dark about the military action.",

    "summary": "The new Idaho law appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\"Withdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\" the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \"When her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\"",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho's law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\"My medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\" she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \"lawful.\" But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\"I am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\" Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

    "story": [
      "Republicans on the House Oversight Committee have subpoenaed Anthony Bernal, a senior aide to former first lady Jill Biden, as part of their rapidly expanding investigation into former President Joe Biden's mental fitness while in office.",
      "The subpoena \u2014 signed Thursday by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the Republican Oversight chairman \u2014 requires Bernal to appear for a deposition on July 16. It came after several weeks of back-and-forth with Bernal's lawyer over the timing of a voluntary interview, which Comer says ended with Bernal withdrawing from an interview scheduled for Thursday.",
      "\"Given your close connection with both former President Biden and former First Lady Jill Biden, the Committee sought to understand if you contributed to an effort to hide former President Biden's fitness to serve from the American people,\" a cover letter for the subpoena reads. \"To avoid any further delays, your appearance before the Committee is now compelled.\"",
      "Bernal is the second former Biden staffer to be subpoenaed by the committee and unlikely to be the last. The committee this week heard voluntary testimony from Neera Tanden, a former director of Biden's domestic policy counsel, and is intent on securing interviews with several other members of Biden's inner circle as part of its investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Bernal's attorney for comment.",
      "Comer has also subpoenaed Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as Biden's physician at the White House. O'Connor will testify before the committee on July 9. The committee said it compelled O'Connor to testify after his lawyers said he could not appear for an interview, arguing it would violate local laws and ethical rules against doctors disclosing confidential medical information.",
      "It's all part of a Republican effort, supported by President Trump, to investigate the last occupant of the Oval Office. Mr. Trump himself has ordered White House lawyers and the Justice Department to investigate Biden's aides, questioning the legitimacy of his alleged use of the autopen to sign pardons and other documents. Mr. Trump has long suggested that the use of autopen could nullify some of Biden's executive actions, an idea some legal experts have pushed back on.",
      "In a statement earlier this month, Biden called the attacks \"ridiculous and false,\" and said, \"I made the decisions during my presidency,\" including on pardons.",
      "Boosting the GOP investigation, Mr. Trump has waived executive privilege for eight former Biden administration officials to testify to Congress, including Bernal, a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and insisted on anonymity told the Associated Press. Executive privilege is a legal doctrine that allows presidents to keep certain internal communications secret.",
      "With the privilege lifted, former staffers are free to discuss their interactions with Biden while he was president.",
      "Comer said Bernal's attorneys had initially offered to do a transcribed interview on Thursday, but then on Wednesday, his lawyers told the committee he was not willing to appear voluntarily on that date. Comer accused him of \"running scared\" after the privilege was waived.",
      "In addition to Bernal, executive privilege has been waived for Biden White House senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn, former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, former counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti, former deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and a former assistant to the president, Ashley Williams. Comer is seeking interviews with all of them.",
      "Democrats have dismissed the inquiry into Biden's mental state as a partisan exercise that distracts from other pressing issues.",
      "Rep. Wesley Bell, a Missouri Democrat who sits on the Oversight committee, said after the interview with Tanden that it \"was an extraordinary waste of time\" and produced \"no new evidence.\"",
      "Bell said lawmakers should focus on issues like the costs of food, housing and potential changes to healthcare policy rather than \"dig up some kind of post-impeachment, or whatever we're doing here.\"",
      "The unfolding investigation has grown in scope in recent weeks, as new reporting emerges about Biden's final year in office \u2014 including concerns about his age and the circumstances of his decision not to run for reelection. Biden has long denied that his cognitive abilities had faded while in office.",
      "The probe could have significant implications for politics and policy. Republican lawmakers have argued that any executive actions or policies enacted through the autopen procedure could be found invalid if Biden were somehow incapacitated or not of a sound state of mind while in office.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have claimed, without evidence, that Biden was not aware of the actions his administration had taken on a range of issues, including on pardons, environmental policy and labor rights, among other issues.",
      "A move to reverse such executive actions, which would almost certainly face legal scrutiny and a battle in the courts, could impact scores of executive orders taken throughout Biden's term.",
      "\"Let this subpoena send a clear message to Biden's inner circle: We will stop at nothing to expose the truth about Joe Biden's decline (and) unauthorized use of the autopen,\" Comer wrote on social media.",

    "summary": "It's the latest legal strategy for environmental groups as they try to claw back terminated grants.",
    "story": [
      "When Donald Trump won reelection, Jennifer Hadayia knew she'd need a good lawyer. As the executive director of Air Alliance Houston, an environmental nonprofit advocacy organization that works to reduce the risks of air pollution on public health, she had fought the first Trump administration in court already on a variety of issues.",
      "But when Lee Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, began terminating environmental justice grants awarded by the Biden-era EPA in January and announced \"the greatest day of deregulation\" in mid-March to dismantle dozens of environmental policies, Hadaiya was gobsmacked: \"We are in the very worst possible situation to couple regulatory rollbacks with funding decimation.\"",
      "Hadayia isn't the only one in this position. Zeldin's immediate termination of some $3 billion from the Environmental and Climate Justice block program impacted 350 environmental organizations, cities and tribes that all saw their grants evaporate without warning.",
      "Environmental justice grants are intended to help protect people from disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants or environmental hazards and ensure everyone has access to a healthy living environment. For instance, lower-income communities that live near factories are often more exposed to pollutants that may damage their health.",
      "Rather than sue the agency on its own, as many others are currently doing, Air Alliance Houston will be trying a new legal tactic: joining a first-of-its-kind proposed\u00a0class action lawsuit against the EPA and Zeldin to restore funding.",
      "\"We're not in it just for us,\" Hadayia told CBS News, \"Communities across the country that were\u00a0 selected for these funds all have needs. The class action benefits the greater good.\"",
      "EPA cut funding to program that tracks permits for pollution",
      "Air Alliance Houston was awarded a $3.1-million \"community change grant\" by the Biden EPA in 2024 to expand a program it created to bring more transparency to the Texas state environmental permitting process. The program, called Air Mail, tracks permits for pollution and alerts communities in Harris County, Texas, when a company requests a permit, so people know what may be emitted into the air and water near their home. Hadayia planned to expand the program to 10 other counties in Texas.",
      "She was one of 2,700 applicants who applied for the award. In fact, it was the first time Hadayia had ever tried to win a federal grant for Air Alliance Houston, and she was thrilled to receive the government's support.",
      "\"We didn't want to have to rely on private philanthropy forever,\" she said.",
      "She filled out 20 pages of forms detailing requirements, compliance certification, underwent rigorous vetting and completed numerous checklists and reviews. In February, she said she seemed to lose consistent access to the grant money without warning, although at times, it would appear again in the nonprofit's accounts.",
      "\"Randomly with no notice, I would get access to the money again,\" Hadayia said.",
      "Between February and May, she checked her account twice a day, every day. On four occasions, she said she successfully accessed funds, withdrawing a total of $60,000 to reimburse eligible expenses before she finally received a termination letter on May 1.",
      "The EPA did not respond to questions about why it terminated the grants.",
      "\"We believe that our contract was illegally terminated. There was nothing in our terms and conditions that allows an administration \u2014 Trump or otherwise \u2014 to cancel a federal contract because they don't like what the contract is about,\" Hadayia told CBS News. \"There was no noncompliance. There was no fraud, waste and abuse. We were selected rigorously and\u00a0 appropriately. We met all of the requirements. We were doing everything right.\"",
      "The new legal strategy for environmental groups",
      "Air Alliance Houston is one of 23 plaintiffs in the suit, and together, they are hoping the court will grant their request to certify and move forward as a class action. The other plaintiffs include environmental organizations, as well as local city governments, like Kalamazoo County, Michigan, and federally recognized tribes such as the Native Village of Kipnuk in Alaska.",
      "Like Air Alliance Houston, all of the plaintiffs were awarded grants of various amounts through the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which was funded with $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act. The purpose of the grants is to address the climate crisis and various environmental harms at the local level.",
      "The grants were awarded to groups in rural and urban communities throughout the United States for a variety of initiatives including air quality monitoring, tree planting in urban heat areas, lead pipes replacement to improve community drinking water systems and resilience projects to bolster communities against intensifying extreme weather.",
      "CBS News contacted the EPA about the lawsuit, but the agency responded in an email saying it does not comment on current or pending litigation.",
      "Suing the Trump administration has become a full-time job for many environmental organizations affected by its funding cuts. Major groups like the Environmental Defense Fund, or the Natural Resources Defense Council, which employs hundreds of people and generate roughly $200 million in annual revenue, can sustain prolonged legal challenges to the federal government. Since 2025, the NRDC has been involved in 11 cases against the Trump administration.",
      "The nonprofits say that utilizing the court system is the only check on power they can lean on, and to date, the Trump administration has not prevailed in any of the environmental lawsuits filed. It is currently appealing the rulings, many of which would restore funding to environmental groups.",
      "Some nonprofits have been successful in getting their funding restarted, even during the appeals process. But not all nongovernmental organizations have the resources for a sustained legal battle.",
      "Air Alliance Houston is a small group that employs just 13 people, Hadaiya included, and it often spends more money than it makes. In 2023, according to available tax records, it generated $2.5 million in revenue, but had more than $2.7 million in expenses.",
      "The class action lawsuit would make it possible for Air Alliance Houston and smaller nonprofits to win broad relief, rather than piecemeal outcomes, and to pool their resources for what may be a long legal fight against the Trump EPA.",
      "Jillian Blanchard, a vice president at the Climate Change and Environmental Justice program at Lawyers for Good Government, called the termination of the EPA grants \"unconstitutional\" and said in a statement it was \"not only destabilizing local projects addressing pollution, public health, and climate resilience,\" but also violates \"core principles of administrative law and the separation of powers.\"",
      "Her group joined EarthJustice, the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Public Rights Project to file the case on behalf of the plaintiffs.",
      "Blanchard told CBS News she's never seen a class action lawsuit filed against the federal government over environmental funding issues. By bringing the class action case, the hope is to provide relief to the full class of eligible recipients, rather than forcing individual groups to seek pro bono legal assistance or spend their own limited budgets navigating their case through the court system.",
      "Hadayia considers herself fortunate, since she hasn't needed to furlough staff after her funds were cut. But she hopes the lawsuit can reinstate the grant, so she can finish the work. She wants the same for the other 349 eligible class members of the suit, who also spent significant time applying for awards to support communities that are struggling to address environmental pollution and climate change impacts.",
      "\"It is the one-two punch of this administration to 'unleash American energy' by taking all of the\u00a0 roadblocks away,\" said Hadayia. \"And at the same time, pulling out the resources from groups like mine whose mission is to advocate for the opposite, whose mission is to be the watchdog for those industries.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The White House made a push for the centerpiece legislation of President Trump's second term, hosting a \"One, Big, Beautiful Event\" on Thursday highlighting the bill amid intraparty disagreements and roadblocks in the Senate as lawmakers near a Fourth of July deadline.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate GOP leaders are working to pass the bill in the upper chamber. The bill would then be sent back to the House to approve the changes before it can reach Mr. Trump's desk for his signature. But the\u00a0self-imposed July 4 deadline looms large over the effort, with key disagreements remaining.",
      "With an array of working-class Americans standing behind him, from farmers to electrical workers, the president claimed the bill would lower Americans' tax burdens, make permanent his first administration's tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips.",
      "\"This is the ultimate codification of our agenda to \u2014 very simply, a phrase that's been used pretty well by me over the past 10 years, but maybe even before that \u2014 make America great again,\" Mr. Trump said in the White House East Room.",
      "He also called the legislation the \"single-most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress,\" pointing to the bill's pledge to hire thousands of new border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The president reiterated his administration's goal of deporting at least 1 million undocumented immigrants every year.",
      "It was Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's border czar, who had the strongest words for Congress at the White House, saying he's tired of meeting parents whose children have been killed by someone in the country illegally, or parents whose children have been killed by drugs brought into the country.",
      "\"What the hell is the matter with everybody up in Congress? People are dying every day. \u2026 Pass the bill so we can make this country safe.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt met with House Republicans on the conservative Republican Study Committee on Wednesday and told reporters that the administration is working to \"make sure everyone understands this bill needs to be back on the president's desk by July 4.\"",
      "\"The White House and the president have been consistently engaged in this process since the very beginning, both on the House side and on the Senate side,\" Leavitt said, adding that Mr. Trump \"is always willing to make calls, and we're going to get this bill done.\"",
      "But as the deadline approaches, Republicans in Congress have squabbled over key provisions in the legislation, like Medicaid restrictions used to pay for the bill's new spending.",
      "Shortly before the president's afternoon event, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he's asking Congress to remove a tax provision that targets dividends, royalties, interest and business profits earned by individuals and institutions abroad. Complying with Bessent's request would make the legislation more expensive.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding in part by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031. The House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. The Senate's move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House.",
      "Then on Thursday morning, Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee announced that the provider tax plan was among a handful of key provisions that the Senate's rulekeeper had determined would violate what's known as the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending.",
      "The parliamentarian's rulings",
      "Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has been examining the legislation to determine whether any provisions violate Senate rules. Any that are in violation are subject to a 60-vote threshold, rather than the simple majority required under the reconciliation process.",
      "Senate Democrats said the parliamentarian also weighed in on a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services.",
      "The announcement on the rulings came days after the parliamentarian determined that Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court, along with a section barring immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands. She struck provisions regarding the sale of electric vehicles used by the U.S. Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for \"sanctuary cities\" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "Senate Republicans are working to bring some of the measures into compliance with the parliamentarian's rulings; her deliberations on other parts of the legislation are ongoing.",
      "GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana called the parliamentarian's decision on the provider tax a \"setback,\" adding that Senate Republicans would decide whether to rewrite the details of the provision to comply with the Byrd Rule \u2014 or move forward without the provider tax.",
      "The move sparked pushback among some congressional Republicans. Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, said Vice President JD Vance, the president of the Senate, should overrule the parliamentarian. And GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said she should be fired.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters Thursday that the parliamentarian's ruling was \"pretty frustrating.\" But he said he's \"optimistic that we can come up with ways to make sure we fulfill the Trump agenda and also have fiscal sanity.\" And Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he expected the conference would try to retool the provision. Although he doesn't agree with the ruling, Graham said he has \"no intention of overruling her.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who was asked about the possibility of overruling the parliamentarian earlier this month, said \"we're not going there.\"",
      "But Thune faced difficulties even before the rulekeeper's decisions, as he worked to keep his conference together on the massive legislation. On Wednesday, he told reporters, \"We're working with all of our members to try to get people comfortable with the bill.\"",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can afford to lose just three Republicans on the bill, with all Democrats expected to oppose.",
      "Thune said earlier in the week that \"when push comes to shove, you're looking at whether or not you're going to allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good.\"",
      "\"You have to recognize that this is a process whereby everybody doesn't get everything they want,\" Thune said. \"But I think we've produced a bill working with the House, working with the White House, that will get the requisite number of Republican senators to vote for it so that we can pass it.\"",

      "\"We want to ensure we can get to a place where Iran agrees to a non-enrichment, civil nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"And there are many other requests that the United States has.\"",
      "The Trump administration is considering a range of options to entice Iran back to the negotiating table, a source familiar with the planning told CBS News.",
      "Options include helping Iran to access $20 billion to $30 billion, so it can build a civilian, non-enrichment, energy-producing nuclear program, the source said. The funds would come not from the U.S., but from U.S. allies in the Middle East.",
      "Sanctions relief is also under discussion \u2014 provided that Iran commits to zero enrichment of uranium. Another possibility is allowing Iranian authorities to access the $6 billion currently sitting in restricted foreign bank accounts. Administration officials have even considered encouraging Middle Eastern partners to pay for Iran to rebuild the Fordo nuclear facility as a non-enrichment operation. CNN first reported the potential options.",

She told the paper that emergency room doctors were hesitant to treat the life-threatening complication because they were worried about running afoul of Florida's strict six-week abortion ban \u2014 an incident she blamed on \"fearmongering\" by opponents of the state law.",
      "\"Since then, we've [received] thousands of hate-filled messages and dozens of credible threats from pro-abortion activists, which law enforcement is actively investigating,\" Cammack wrote in her post, which also included screenshots of several social media comments.",

      "Cammack said in a statement to CBS News that her district offices were evacuated due to death threats.",

      "Concerns about medical treatment for pregnancy complications \u2014 including ectopic pregnancies \u2014 have spiked since 2022, when the reversal of Roe v. Wade led dozens of states to ban or heavily restrict abortion.",
      "State-level abortion bans generally allow for exceptions when a mother's life is at risk. And officials in Florida and other states say terminating an ectopic pregnancy \u2014 a condition in which an embryo implants outside the uterus \u2014 is not considered an abortion. But critics argue confusion about those exceptions has put patients at risk, as medical providers may be wary of taking action that could later be found to violate their state's abortion ban.",
      "Florida state regulators issued a\u00a0notice\u00a0last year that said \"abortion is permissible at any stage of pregnancy in Florida to save the life and health of the mother,\" including for women with ectopic pregnancies. The state called claims to the contrary \"misinformation.\"",
      "Meanwhile, threats against members of Congress, judges, prosecutors and other public officials have grown in recent years, federal law enforcement agencies say.

      "\"This report acknowledges it's likely severe damage,\" Hegseth said. \"Again, this is preliminary, leaked \u2014 because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful.\" But while Hegseth disputed the significance of the report's conclusions, he did not deny that the leaked assessment was authentic.",

      "Scientists have identified what could be the oldest rocks on Earth from a rock formation in Canada.",
      "The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt has long been known for its ancient rocks - plains of streaked gray stone on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in Quebec. But researchers disagree on exactly how old they are.",
      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",
      "\"To have a sample of what was going on on Earth way back then is really valuable,\" said Mark Reagan with the University of Iowa, who studies volcanic rocks and lava and was not involved with the new study.",
      "Inuit community wants steps to avoid rocks being exploited",
      "The rock formation is on tribal Inukjuak lands and the local Inuit community has temporarily restricted scientists from taking samples from the site due to damage from previous visits.",
      "After some geologists visited the site, large chunks of rock were missing and the community noticed pieces for sale online, said Tommy Palliser, who manages the land with the Pituvik Landholding Corp. The Inuit community wants to work with scientists to set up a provincial park that would protect the land while allowing researchers to study it.",

      "\"We  had an incredible ride uphill, and now we'd like to set our course for  the International Space Station aboard the newest member of the Dragon  fleet, our spacecraft named Grace. ... Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.",
      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "She ranks ninth in the world for cumulative time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",
      "As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker \u2014 seventh in the world overall \u2014 with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth. And having adapted to that environment, it is fun for me to share my experience with the rookie flyers that are going with me.",
      "\"I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,\" she added.",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying \"we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for.\"",
      "The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three private astronaut missions.",
      "Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab.",
      "\"We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,\" Whitson said. \"The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station.",
      "\"Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well.\"",
      "All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission \"opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.\"",

      "\"So, we really need very sharp images,\" Urbach said.",
      "The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, \"really far away ... means they come from earlier times.\"",
      "The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter \u2014 a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies.",
      "Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown.",
      "The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids.",
      "In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects \u2014 all of which pose no threat.",
      "For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year.",

      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",
      "Both the majority and dissenting opinions included pages from the storybooks, though the justices disagreed as to their messages.",
      "Alito wrote that the books \"unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint about same-sex marriage and gender,\" and are \"designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\"",
      "But in Sotomayor's view, the books introduce readers to LGBTQ characters, but drawn on common themes presented to children in other works, such as overcoming difficulties, celebrating milestones or fairytale romances.",
      "The school board adopted the lessons in 2022 and allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the picture books. But in March 2023, it ended the policy and said families would no longer receive advance notice of when the books would be read, and would not be able to have their children excused from the instruction.",
      "The Board of Education had said that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" since some schools had high numbers of absences. It said all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers had to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, though, sparked backlash throughout the community, with more than 1,000 parents signing a petition that called on the board to restore the opt-outs and dozens appearing at board meetings.",
      "Three Montgomery County families filed a lawsuit against the education board over the decision to end the opt-outs, arguing it violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families are a diverse coalition of religions \u2014 Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox.",
      "A federal district court in Maryland and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled for the school board, finding that there was no evidence that the families were compelled to violate their religious beliefs or conduct.",

      "President Trump says he's \"terminating all discussions on trade with Canada, effective immediately,\" after Canada announced a digital services tax on large foreign and domestic technology companies.",
      "Posting on Truth Social Friday afternoon, the president said the U.S. will let Canada know what their tariff rate will be in the next week. The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",
      "\"We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country,\" the president wrote. \"They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately.\"",
      "Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year, will hit tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Meta and Uber with a 3% tax on revenue from users in Canada.

    "story": [
      "A bison died after it appeared to stumble into a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park last week while visitors looked on.",
      "The incident occurred during the early morning of June 21 at Grand Prismatic Spring near Old Faithful as tourists were enjoying a close-up view of the famous and popular hot spring, according to witnesses and a spokesperson for Yellowstone.",
      "\"There were two bison (standing) there,\" said Louise Howard, who was visiting Yellowstone from Colorado for the first time. \"I thought it was a great photo opportunity.\"",
      "She told CBS News on Friday that one of the bison started walking toward the spring and appeared to step into a shallow part before quickly jumping out. She said that in a manner of about 30 seconds, the bison started walking but stumbled at the edge of the spring and fell in.",
      "\"As hard as it tried, it couldn't get out,\" said Howard, who shared photos on social media.",
      "Rare, but not unheard of",
      "Michael Poland, scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory and a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told CBS News on Friday it is not unprecedented that animals fall into hot springs. He said scientists have found skeletons at hot springs around the park, many of which are in the backcountry, not visited by tourists.",
      "\"There is one pool (in the Lower Geyser Basin) called Skeleton Pool,\" he said. \"What made this a little bit different is that it happened in summer, during the day, at one of the most popular tourist areas in the whole park.\"",
      "Poland said animals usually fall into the hot springs because they are walking too close to the edge and it collapses.",
      "\"There are thin crusts that form on the edges of these and so it's difficult to tell if there is boiling water directly beneath you,\" he said. \"What exactly happened in this case, it's impossible to say.\"",
      "\"There are animals that walk through that area all the time. When you walk on the boardwalk, you can look down into the water, and you can see all kinds of animal footprints \u2014 bison, elk, coyotes, so forth,\" Poland added.",
      "Nothing could have been done",
      "Poland said the bison died fairly quickly after falling into Grand Prismatic, where temperatures reach about 192 degrees Fahrenheit. The boiling point at Yellowstone is about 200 degrees Fahrenheit because of its high altitude.",
      "He said people can tell how hot the springs are based on the color of the bacteria near the edges.",
      "\"All those colorful edges on Grand Prismatic are different bacteria that live at different temperatures,\" he said. \"The red colors are bacteria that like warm water but not scalding and then as you go in from red to yellow to green, it gets to be hotter and hotter. And then the blue water, there is no bacteria there and that's the hottest water, and in many cases, that is really close to boiling.\"",
      "Poland dispelled rumors that the water in Yellowstone hot springs is highly acidic, saying that most springs in the park are actually neutral \u2014 just really hot.",
      "\"What's dangerous is the fact that they are very close to boiling,\" he said. \"Anyone who's poached a chicken knows what that will do to tissue.\"",
      "A cautionary tale for visitors",
      "Millions of tourists visit Yellowstone National Park each year \u2014 particularly in the busy summer season.",
      "This incident \u2014 and the two events of bison goring tourists this year\u00a0\u2014 are a cautionary tale for visitors who want to enjoy the park and everything it has to offer, Poland said.",
      "He urged people to stay on the boardwalks and follow the rules that Yellowstone's rangers have laid out for visitors.",
      "Yellowstone National Park is renowned for its diverse and abundant wildlife. Visitors commonly see bison, elk, bears and other animals, including wolves, moose, mountain goats and mountain lions.",
      "Anyone walking away from the boardwalks risks injury from the hot springs or wildlife but also risks damaging the landscape.",
      "\"The trails are there for a reason. We're in their environment,\" he said of the animals. \"It's a wild place. The landscape is wild too.\"",
      "Front row seat to nature",
      "Katie Kirtzel, from Utah, told CBS News on Friday that she and her family saw the animal's remains later in the day. She said it was about 7:15 p.m., very foggy and \"really eerie and mysterious\" when they spotted animal prints.",
      "\"There were bear tracks and bison tracks and we were taking pictures of those. And as we were following those tracks, the mist starts to clear a little bit and we see a big, large furry animal,\" she said. \"It was huge. You couldn't really tell what it was, but you could tell that something big had recently fallen into the spring.\"",
      "She said seeing the animal was a \"very profound\" and \"unique\" experience.",
      "\"My family and everybody else who was there was kind of taking in the moment, realizing that it was something really special that we walked on,\" Kirtzel said, adding: \"It's so cool to see the cycle (of life) in such an extreme way, right in front of your face.\"",
      "\"I really recommend people visit the park, and I certainly hope that if they do, they keep in mind that this is what we have the parks for,\" Kirtzel added. \"This is nature. This isn't something that's scary. This is something that is natural and incredible to experience if you do.\"",
      "Howard said that despite the tragic incident, the three days she spent at Yellowstone were some of the best of her life.",
      "\"You never get such a front row seat to nature,\" she said, adding: \"I think some people see Yellowstone as a zoo because of how they interact with the animals but it's not. Those animals are wild and they are doing their thing. We are guests in their area.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 15:13:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court, ruling in the birthright citizenship case, reined in federal judges' ability to issue nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump praised the Supreme Court for its decision Friday limiting the ability of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, calling it a \"monumental victory for the Constitution.\"",
      "In comments at the White House, the president said, \"This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch.\"",
      "The Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions by federal judges, a practice the president and his allies have railed against as blocking or hindering their agenda. In a\u00a06-3 decision\u00a0that stemmed from the president's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court said universal injunction orders likely exceeded the authority Congress has given the federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump called the use of nationwide injunctions \"a grave threat to democracy, frankly.\"",
      "Thanks to this decision, the president said the administration can \"now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,\" including his effort to end birthright citizenship. Attorney General Pam Bondi predicted the Supreme Court would \"most likely\" rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship case during the next Supreme Court term, which begins this fall.",
      "Mr. Trump repeated a statement he often makes about birthright citizenship, a provision of the 14th Amendment, saying that it's no longer being used as it was originally intended. \"Hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship, and it wasn't meant for that reason,\" he said. \"It was meant for the babies of slaves.\"",
      "The president thanked Barrett for writing the opinion \"brilliantly,\" and also the justices who sided with her.",
      "In the dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates. Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship,\" and the court's ruling means that \"absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also applauded other Supreme Court rulings, including a decision Friday to allow parents in a Maryland school district to opt their children out of storybooks based on objections to their approach to gender and sexuality.",
      "\"I think the ruling was a great ruling, and I think it's a great ruling for parents,\" the president said.",
      "The president addressed other topics beyond the Supreme Court rulings, too, including his administration's tariffs and his trade negotiations with other countries. Although the president indicated his administration is close to deals with several countries, he said at some point in the next week and a half, his administration will be sending letters to some countries \"and tell them what they have to pay.\"",
      "On Iran, the president expressed support for any new agreement with Iran, including a provision that the International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 or \"somebody\" approved by the U.S. \u2014 act as an independent inspector to examine Iranian nuclear facilities.",

      "The Trump administration will revoke the legal status and work permits of hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants in early September, arguing that conditions in Haiti have sufficiently improved for them to return home, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said it would terminate Haiti's longstanding Temporary Protected Status program, which has allowed immigrants from the crisis-stricken Caribbean nation to live and work in the U.S. legally since 2010, following the devastating earthquake that year.",
      "If they don't qualify for another legal immigration status \u2014 like asylum or a green card \u2014 those who lose their TPS protections will become ineligible to work in the U.S. legally and eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday urged Haitians with TPS to voluntarily leave the U.S. by using a smartphone app that officials have converted into a system to facilitate self-deportations. The administration has warned immigrants in the U.S. illegally that if they don't self-deport, they will be found, arrested and forcibly deported.",
      "\"This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,\" DHS said in a statement. \"The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.\"",
      "As of late last year, more than a quarter of a million Haitians \u2014 260,790 \u2014 had been approved for TPS, according to government data compiled by Congress' research unit. DHS said their TPS protections would lapse on Sept. 2.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the federal government to offer migrants work permits and a reprieve from deportation if their home countries are engulfed in a crisis, such as a war or an environmental disaster.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's assertions on Friday, the U.S. government has described Haiti as a country with deep political instability and plagued by gang violence and widespread poverty. In fact, the State Department instructs Americans not to visit Haiti in a Level 4 travel advisory, warning them about the threat of \"robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "The Biden administration vastly expanded the TPS program for Haitians, allowing many of those who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 illegally and legally \u2014 to qualify for the initiative. It also used TPS at an unprecedented scale to offer legal status to hundreds of thousands migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Venezuela, Ukraine and other nations.",
      "But President Trump's administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, as part of its efforts to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, officials have announced plans to terminate TPS protections for Afghans, Cameronians and Venezuelans. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed the administration to end the work permits and deportation protections of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans TPS recipients.",

      "Attorney Marc Angifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began a presentation expected to last several hours.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that created a second majority-Black district.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that was approved by the state's GOP-led legislature and created a second majority-Black district.",
      "An order from the court issued on the last day of its term restored the case to its calendar for reargument, with an additional scheduling order to come. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the move to order more arguments and said the court should have decided the case.",
      "The move means the state's map with two majority-Black districts remains intact for now.",
      "The district lines at the center of the dispute were invalidated in 2022 by a three-judge lower court panel, which sided with a group of self-described \"non-African-American voters\" who had challenged the House map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The map wasn't the first crafted by the state's Republican-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census. Instead, Louisiana's efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.",
      "The case demonstrated the challenges state lawmakers face when trying to balance complying with the Voting Rights Act without relying too much on race during the drawing the political lines, which can run afoul of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court's decision is also likely to have implications for the balance of power in the House in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to hold onto their razor-thin majority.",
      "The legal wrangling over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned several years and began after the state legislature redrew the six House districts in early 2022. A federal judge in Baton Rouge ruled that year that the map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it diluted Black voting strength, and ordered the state to put a remedial plan in place that had two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "That initial map had one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts, even though African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The new map adopted by the state legislature reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state lawmakers said. But they said they also had a second goal: to protect powerful Republican incumbents in the House, namely Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow. Letlow is the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, state officials noted.",
      "The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge in the southeast, connecting predominantly Black communities along the way.",
      "But after the new voting lines were adopted, 12 \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged the reconfigured District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel sitting in Shreveport agreed and said the legislature relied too much on race when it drew the new House district lines. Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups \u2014 who were on opposing sides in the challenge to the original map \u2014 to ask the Supreme Court to let the state use the new congressional map for the 2024 elections.",
      "The high court granted their request for emergency relief, and in November, Louisiana voters sent two Black Democrats to Congress. The Supreme Court then agreed to take up the case.",
      "The redistricting dispute is one of several the high court has been confronted with in recent years, and more continue to make their way to the justices. In a landmark 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, which required certain states and localities with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices to receive Justice Department approval before changing their election rules.",
      "Then, in 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have a role to play in deciding legal fights over partisan gerrymandering, when state's voting lines are drawn to entrench the political party in power.",
      "But in an unexpected ruling in 2023, the Supreme Court declined an invitation to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Instead, the high court invalidated Alabama's congressional map crafted after the 2020 Census, which ultimately led to the election of the state's second Black House member.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:54:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The court ruled that universal injunctions issued by lower courts likely exceed the authority Congress has granted them.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday limited the use of nationwide injunctions, reining in federal judges' ability to issue sweeping orders that have in recent years stymied implementation of policies from Republican and Democratic presidential administrations alike.",
      "In a widely anticipated decision stemming from President Trump's executive order seeking to end\u00a0birthright citizenship, the high court said that universal orders likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to the federal courts. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with the liberal justices in dissent.",
      "The court granted the Trump administration request to narrow the reach of the injunctions blocking the president's executive order while proceedings move forward, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief\" to plaintiffs who can sue, Barrett wrote. The justices did not address the question of whether Mr. Trump's order is constitutional, and the administration has said agencies have 30 days to issue public guidance about implementation of the policy, allowing time for more challenges to be filed.",
      "\"Some say that the universal injunction 'give[s] the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch.' But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,\" Barrett wrote. \"When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.\"",
      "In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the majority of abdicating its role in protecting the rule of law. She read portions of her dissenting opinion from the bench.",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the president has made a 'solemn mockery' of our Constitution,\" she wrote. \"Rather than stand firm, the court gives way.\"",
      "At a White House news conference following the decision, Mr. Trump praised it as \"a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Universal injunctions and the birthright citizenship case",
      "The court's ruling came in a trio of emergency appeals by the Trump administration arising out of the president's executive order seeking to end the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, which means that everyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to narrow the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's policy nationwide while legal challenges brought by 22 states, immigrants' rights groups and seven individuals moved forward.",
      "But instead of swiftly deciding whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief, the Supreme Court held arguments on whether to restrict the use of nationwide, or universal, injunctions, which are judicial orders that prevent the government from enforcing a policy anywhere in the country and against anyone, including individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship has become intertwined with the administration's battle against nationwide injunctions. These sweeping orders have frustrated both Democratic and Republican presidents seeking to implement their agendas among gridlock in Congress, and the fight over them has been simmering for several years.",
      "The Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued during Mr. Trump's first term and 28 granted while former President Joe Biden was in office. In Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service found 17 nationwide injunctions were issued during the first 100 days, though the Trump administration estimated last month there have been far more \u2014 at least 40 of these orders, and most coming from the same five judicial districts.",
      "Some of the justices have suggested in past writings that the Supreme Court would have to clarify whether nationwide injunctions are allowed at all, and members on both ideological sides of the bench have been critical of them. The president and his allies have\u00a0attacked judges\u00a0for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for\u00a0some to be impeached.",
      "The president's birthright citizenship order was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office. While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident. The president directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children in those categories born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-a-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the order. Federal appeals courts in California, Massachusetts and Virginia then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the cases. The administration said the Supreme Court should, at a minimum, allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance while proceedings continue, and took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts. Government lawyers said in a filing that universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "But the plaintiffs in the cases urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders in place. In a filing\u00a0of their own, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" since it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.\"",
      "The states argued that the Trump administration seeks to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "The court's decision",
      "Writing for the majority, Barrett looked to the nation's history and said that nationwide injunctions were \"conspicuously nonexistent\" in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. If federal courts had such a tool, she said, \"surely they would not have let it lay idle.\"",
      "\"Nothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a century thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal courts lack authority to issue them,\" she wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor warned that the Supreme Court's new regime puts all manner of constitutional rights at risk and renders them \"meaningful in name only\" for people who are not parties to a lawsuit.",
      "\"Today, the threat is birthright citizenship,\" she wrote. \"Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the court's conservative majority of ignoring whether Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship is constitutional and said its \"patent unlawfulness\" underscores why universal injunctions are appropriate remedies.",
      "While the high court agreed to grant Mr. Trump's request for a partial stay of the injunctions, Barrett wrote that there are still issues for the lower courts to decide, including whether narrower relief is appropriate.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision still allows plaintiffs challenging a policy to file class-action lawsuits and seek certification of a nationwide class. In her dissent, Sotomayor urged individuals who may be impacted by Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship plan, as well as lower courts, to move swiftly.",
      "\"[T]he parents of children covered by the Citizenship Order would be well advised to file promptly class-action suits and to request temporary injunctive relief for the putative class pending class certification,\" she wrote. \"For suits challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order, moreover, lower courts would be wise to act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court's prompt review.\"",
      "On the heels of the Supreme Court's decision, CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, asked the federal district court to allow its lawsuit to proceed on a classwide basis and certify as a class \"all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.\"",

    "summary": "Nineteen states have approved measures that require pornography websites to ensure that visitors are at least 18 years old.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Texas law that requires pornography websites to verify their visitors' age, finding that the lower court applied the appropriate level of judicial review when evaluating the constitutionality of the age-verification laws.",
      "The high court divided 6-3 along ideological lines, with Justice Clarence Thomas authoring the decision for the majority. The Supreme Court said that the law survives a more heightened form of judicial scrutiny.",
      "\"We granted certiorari to decide whether these burdens likely render [Texas law] H. B. 1181 unconstitutional under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. We hold that they do not,\" Thomas wrote. \"The power to require age verification is within a State's authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content,\" he continued, saying Texas' law \"is a constitutionally permissible exercise of that authority.\"",
      "\"The statute does not ban adults from accessing this material; it simply requires them to verify their age before accessing it on a covered website,\" Thomas noted.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the dissenting opinion that while \"everyone agrees that shielding children from exposure to the sexually explicit speech H. B. 1181 targets is a compelling state interest,\" the Texas law should be subject to the most stringent standard of judicial review, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' ability to view constitutionally protected speech based on its content.",
      "\"That is what foundational First Amendment principles demand,\" Kagan concluded.",
      "While the law at issue in the case was passed in Texas, 18 other states have approved similar measures that require pornography websites to ensure that visitors are at least 18 years old. Challengers to the Texas law \u2014 a group of companies that operate covered websites and a trade group called the Free Speech Coalition \u2014 have argued that it violates the First Amendment by burdening adults' access to protected speech.",
      "Under the Texas law, enacted in 2023, entities must comply if more than one-third of their web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Companies subject to its requirements have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "In response to the challenge to the law brought by the Free Speech Coalition and website operators, a federal district court judge agreed to block enforcement of the age-verification requirement. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit froze that decision, which allowed the law to take effect. The Supreme Court last year allowed Texas to continue enforcing the age-verification measure while it weighed the case, known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton.",
      "The key question before the high court was whether the 5th Circuit applied the correct standard of review when it evaluated the age-verification law. The appeals court applied the most deferential level of review, rational basis, and found that the requirement satisfied it. But the plaintiffs in the case and the Biden administration said the appeals court was wrong to apply that standard and should have instead analyzed it under the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because the law impedes adults' access to speech protected by the Constitution.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under strict scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 11:47:18 -0400",
    "summary": "New federal data showed that inflation edged up in May, but U.S. prices show only modest impact from U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, inched higher in May, the latest sign that inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, according to the PCE data. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, up from a rate of 2.5% the previous month.",
      "While inflation ticked higher, prices across the U.S. haven't yet shown a major impact from the Trump administration's tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned earlier this week that inflation could reignite this summer as the import duties are passed through to consumers.",
      "Consumers also pared their spending last month, marking their first reduction since January, while incomes also dropped, the Commerce Department\u00a0said\u00a0on Friday. The pullback in spending, which dropped 0.1% last month, comes after Americans opened their wallets earlier in the year to buy goods before the tariffs took effect, economists said.",
      "\"While the spending numbers fell slightly and came in below expectations, we would not read too much into these numbers as this weakness is probably primarily just payback from the jump in spending earlier this year as consumers tried to buy goods ahead of the tariffs,\" Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Incomes dropped after a one-time adjustment to Social Security benefits had boosted payments in March and April. Social Security payments were raised for some retirees who had worked for state and local governments due to the Social Security Fairness Act.",
      "Modest impact from tariffs",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Trump's broad-based tariffs are still having only a modest effect on prices. The cost of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month's 0.1%.",
      "Economists point to several reasons why Trump's tariffs have yet to accelerate the pace of inflation, as many analysts had expected. Like American consumers, companies imported billions of dollars of goods in the spring before the duties kicked in, and many items currently on store shelves were imported without paying higher levies.",
      "Some businesses are also absorbing higher import costs, cushioning consumers from price hikes.",
      "\"For the moment, there is nothing of consequence to worry about on the inflation side of this report,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told clients in a research note. \"There is, however, an unexpected drop in consumer spending, the first since the pandemic. That is something to think about. The Fed will make note of this report.\"",

      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 during President Joe Biden's term. In Friday's social media video, Hegseth said that the ship's name change was made in line with \"taking the politics out of ship naming.\"",

      "\"People want to be proud of the ship they're sailing in,\" Hegseth said.",

The meteor was first seen at an altitude of 48 miles above the town of Oxford, Georgia, moving southwest at 30,000 miles per hour, said Bill Cooke, a lead at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.",
      "The fireball later exploded 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, unleashing an energy of about 20 tons of TNT. Cooke said the fireball was 3 feet in diameter and weighed more than a ton (2,000 pounds).",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 11:35:54 -0400",
    "summary": "A former White House press secretary, Bill Moyers also worked as a correspondent for CBS News during his long career in TV journalism.",
    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television's most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91. His former producer, Judy Doctoroff, confirmed his death to CBS News.",
      "Moyers died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. Moyers' son, William Cope Moyers, said his father died at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York after a long illness.",
      "Moyers' career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson's press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \"The CBS Evening News\" and chief correspondent for \"CBS Reports.\"",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV's most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \"The Secret Government\" about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \"Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\" a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men's Movement, and his 1993 series \"Healing and the Mind\" had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \"talking heads\" - shots of subject and interviewer talking - Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \"The question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\"",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \"a soft, probing style\" in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn't necessarily deny.",
      "\"I'm an old-fashioned liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people's ideas,\" he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \"citizen journalist\" operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \"the conversation of democracy open to all comers,\" he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\"I think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\" he said another time, \"but they've chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\"",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",
      "Born in Hugo, Oklahoma, on June 5, 1934, Billy Don Moyers was the son of a dirt farmer-truck driver who soon moved his family to Marshall, Texas. High school led him into journalism.",
      "\"I wanted to play football, but I was too small. But I found that by writing sports in the school newspaper, the players were always waiting around at the newsstand to see what I wrote,\" he recalled.",
      "He worked for the Marshall News Messenger at age 16. Deciding that Bill Moyers was a more appropriate byline for a sportswriter, he dropped the \"y\" from his name.",
      "He graduated from the University of Texas and earned a master's in divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He was ordained and preached part time at two churches but later decided his call to the ministry \"was a wrong number.\"",
      "His relationship with Johnson began when he was in college; he wrote the then-senator offering to work in his 1954 re-election campaign. Johnson was impressed and hired him for a summer job. He was back in Johnson's employ as a personal assistant in the early 1960s and for two years, he worked at the Peace Corps, eventually becoming deputy director.",
      "On the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Moyers was in Austin helping with the presidential trip. He flew back to Washington on Air Force One with newly sworn-in President Johnson, for whom he held various jobs over the ensuing years, including press secretary.",
      "Moyers' stint as presidential press secretary was marked by efforts to mend the deteriorating relationship between Johnson and the media. But the Vietnam war took its toll and Moyers resigned in December 1966.",
      "Of his departure from the White House, he wrote later, \"We had become a war government, not a reform government, and there was no creative role left for me under those circumstances.\"",
      "He conceded that he may have been \"too zealous in my defense of our policies\" and said he regretted criticizing journalists such as Pulitzer Prize-winner Peter Arnett, then a special correspondent with the AP, and CBS's Morley Safer for their war coverage.",
      "In 1967, Moyers became publisher of Long Island-based Newsday and concentrated on adding news analyses, investigative pieces and lively features. Within three years, the suburban daily had won two Pulitzers. He left the paper in 1970 after the ownership changed. That summer, he traveled 13,000 miles around the country and wrote a best-selling account of his odyssey: \"Listening to America: a Traveler Rediscovers His Country.\"",
      "His next venture was in public television and he won critical acclaim for \"Bill Moyers Journal,\" a series\u00a0in which interviews ranged from Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, to poet Maya Angelou. He was chief correspondent of \"CBS Reports\" from 1976 to 1978, went back to PBS for three years, and then was senior news analyst for CBS from 1981 to 1986.",
      "When CBS cut back on documentaries, he returned to PBS for much less money. \"If you have a skill that you can fold with your tent and go wherever you feel you have to go, you can follow your heart's desire,\" he once said.",
      "Then in 1986, he and his wife, Judith Davidson Moyers, became their own bosses by forming Public Affairs Television,\u00a0an independent shop\u00a0that has not only produced programs such as the 10-hour \"In Search of the Constitution,\" but also paid for them through its own fundraising efforts.",
      "His projects in the 21st century included \"Now,\" a weekly PBS public affairs program; a new edition of \"Bill Moyers Journal\" and a podcast covering racism, voting rights and the rise of Donald Trump, among other subjects.",
      "Moyers married Judith Davidson, a college classmate, in 1954, and they raised three children. Judith eventually became her husband's partner, creative collaborator and president of their production company.",

      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony expected to take place Friday, according to local media reports.",
      "The duo were sighted earlier this week as they arrived via taxi-boat at the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal in Venice.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "Details on the wedding location of have remained under wraps, but Italian papers and Venetian locals predict it will take place Friday on San Giorgio Maggiore. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "The reception is expected to be held on Saturday at Arsenale, a sprawling brick complex and former shipyard that was used from the 12th century until World War I. It's best known today as one of the main venues for the Biennale cultural festivals, which include exhibitions on art, architecture, film, dance, music and theater.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "The event has put a spotlight on the uber-weathly, with local protestors pushing back against the event's extravagance.",
      "\"Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,\" Stella Faye, a university researcher from Venice,\u00a0told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "According to a new Oxfam report, the world's richest 1% have increased their wealth by more than $33.9 trillion since 2015. The report also found that a group of 3,000 billionaires, which includes Bezos, have increased their wealth by $6.5 trillion in real terms since 2015. That's equivalent to 14.6% of global GDP.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion).",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports.",
      "The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests including Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, the Kardashian sisters, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, The Associated Press reported.",

A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",

Last week, protesters gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated.",
      "\"We will always respect the right to speak out, but we reject every form of intolerance and prejudice,\" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in Thursday's edition of Italian newspaper Il Foglio Quotidiano. \"No one in Venice can claim the right of deciding who can enter, who can love, who can celebrate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",
      "The legal battle at the Supreme Court started in 2022 when a group of consumers, a carrier and the nonprofit Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that the fund is unlawful because Congress unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Consumers' Research and found that the combination of Congress' delegation to the FCC, and the commission's subdelegation to the fund administrator violates the Constitution.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the structure of a federal health task force that recommends preventive medical services that must be provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court in the case known as Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc. leaves intact the 16-member U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The task force is part of the Department of Health and Human Service and has for decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions.",
      "The court ruled 6-3 in finding that the task force members are inferior officers, whose appointment by the head of Health and Human Services is consistent with the Constitution's Appointments Clause. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored the majority opinion, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch in dissent.",
      "\"[T]he Task Force members' appointments are fully consistent with the Appointments Clause in Article II of the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"The structure of the Task Force and the manner of appointing its officers preserve the chain of political accountability that was central to the Framers' design of the Appointments Clause: The Task Force members were appointed by and are supervised and directed by the Secretary of HHS. And the Secretary of HHS, in turn, answers to the president of the United States.\"",
      "The work of the task force took on added significance after passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The law requires health insurers and group health plans to provide preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "A group of Christian-owned businesses and individuals filed a lawsuit arguing that the preventive-care coverage mandates cannot be enforced because the task force members were unconstitutionally appointed.",
      "The plaintiffs specifically took issue with the task force's recommendation in June 2019 that PrEP, a medication to prevent HIV, be included in the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. They argued that providing no-cost coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Among the other preventive services recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes, and statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",
      "A federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found that the task force's structure is unconstitutional under the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The courts concluded that its members are principal officers and therefore had to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "But the Supreme Court reversed the 5th Circuit's ruling, finding that task force members are \"inferior officers\" since they are \"removable at will by the Secretary of HHS, and their recommendations are reviewable by the Secretary before they take effect.\"",
      "\"So Task Force members are supervised and directed by the Secretary, who in turn answers to the President, preserving the chain of command in Article II,\" Kavanaugh wrote.",
      "The dispute over the task force saw rare agreement between the Biden administration, which appealed the 5th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, and the Trump administration, which continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "But the legal wrangling over the preventive coverage mandates also threatened to put at risk access to preventive care. Nonprofit organizations warned the Supreme Court that eliminating cost-sharing for services like breast cancer screenings or HIV-prevention medications would dissuade patients from seeking medical care.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. State Department announced Thursday that the Trump administration had approved $30 million in funding for the controversial, opaquely run private food distribution organization known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been criticized by a United Nations agency as \"a death trap\" for hungry Palestinians in the war-torn enclave. It is the first U.S. government funding for the GHF confirmed by the Trump administration.",
      "Since it began operating in May, the GHF says it has distributed more than 46 million meals to Gazans, but its record has been marred by almost daily reports of civilians being killed trying to access its four \"distribution hubs.\"",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said that as of Wednesday, 549 people had been killed near GHF hubs trying to access aid, and more than 4,066 others wounded. The United Nations has reported a lower death toll, saying that 410 people have been killed near the aid hubs.",
      "The GHF dismisses the Ministry of Health's figures as disinformation, and it says daily that nobody has been killed inside any of its hubs, while acknowledging incidents of violence outside the sites and referring to Israel's military for further information.",
      "\"We call on other countries to also support the GHF,\" State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said during a media briefing on Thursday, adding that the U.S. support, \"is simply the latest iteration of President Trump's and Secretary Rubio's pursuit of peace in the region.\"",
      "Pigott said he couldn't say whether the U.S. funds had already been handed over to the GHF.",
      "Asked about the pattern of near-daily reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces around GHF distribution hubs, which the Israeli military says it is investigating, Pigott referred the reporter to the IDF to comment on its investigations, and added: \"Many of these reports are based on Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "Given his emphasis on the Trump administration's priority being the provision of more aid in Gaza, Pigott was asked repeatedly whether the U.S. would push Israel to allow other, well established humanitarian organizations to operate more freely inside the strip. He responded to that question multiple times by repeating his call for other countries to support the GHF.",
      "After being pushed by multiple reporters on the accusations that the GHF hubs are \"traps\" for Israeli forces to fire on civilians, Pigott said it was \"important to realize that Hamas bears sole responsibility for this conflict.\"",
      "Other humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies, have refused to work with the GHF, saying it operates in a way that dehumanizes Palestinians by forcing them to venture long distances for food, and citing repeated instances of violence around its distribution sites.",
      "\"Now is the time for unity and collaboration,\" the GHF said Friday. \"We look forward to other aid and humanitarian organizations joining us so we can feed even more Gazans, together.\"",
      "CBS News has requested in-person, on-camera interviews with GHF representatives repeatedly since the organization's creation was announced. GHF has yet to grant an interview.",
      "Criticism of GFH mounts, as it's labelled \"a death trap\" and a \"U.S. proxy\"",
      "The head of the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA,\u00a0called the operation \"a death trap\" in a scathing statement earlier this week.",
      "There were new reports Friday of Palestinians being fired on near a GHF hub in southern Gaza, near the city of Rafah. An amateur video shared online by local Palestinian news organizations \u2014 which CBS News was not immediately able to independently verify \u2014 showed people laying on the ground for cover as bullets can be heard whizzing past. The video was shared with the caption: \"We are besieged by hunger from behind and death from ahead.\"",
      "The international charity Doctors Without Borders added its voice on Friday to the list of non-governmental organizations decrying the GHF,\u00a0calling the group a \"Israeli-U.S. proxy\" and a \"slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid.\"",
      "\"The four distribution sites, all located in areas under the full control of Israeli forces after people had been forcibly displaced from there, are the size of football fields surrounded by watch points, mounds of earth and barbed wire. The fenced entrance gives only one access point in or out,\" MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza, Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, said in the statement. \"If people arrive early and approach the checkpoints, they get shot. If they arrive on time, but there is an overflow and they jump over the mounds and the wires, they get shot. If they arrive late, they shouldn't be there because it is an 'evacuated zone', they get shot.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that MSF has joined the misinformation smear campaign by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry,\" a GHF spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. \"Many of these alleged incidents were falsely linked to GHF sites when in fact they occurred near other humanitarian convoys or distribution locations.\"",
      "The spokesperson did not reply to a CBS News' question about whether the GHF was created or operates in direct conjunction with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Israeli newspaper Haaretz added further weight to the accusations about violence around GHF hubs in an article published Friday, saying it had been told by some anonymous IDF personnel of a deliberate policy to shoot at crowds near GHF distribution sites. One soldier was quoted as saying he had been deployed near a GHF hub, and he described the situation as \"a killing field.\"",
      "\"Where I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day,\" the soldier told Haaretz, which has long been critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. \"They're treated like a hostile force \u2014 no crowd-control measures, no tear gas \u2014 just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Then, once the center opens, the shooting stops, and they know they can approach. Our form of communication is gunfire.\"",
      "\"We strongly reject the accusation raised in the article,\" the IDF told CBS News in a statement on Friday. \"The IDF did not instruct the forces to deliberately shoot at civilians, including those approaching the distribution centers. To be clear, IDF directives prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians.\"",
      "The military said it was \"operating to allow and facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid by the American 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation' (GHF), and to secure the routes leading to the distribution centers, in order to allow the aid to reach the civilians rather than Hamas.\"",
      "The IDF added that its forces were \"conducting systematic learning processes aimed at improving the operational response in the area (around GHF hubs) and minimizing, as much as possible, potential friction between the civilian population and IDF forces. As part of this effort, IDF forces have recently taken steps to reorganize the area, including the installation of new fencing, signage, the opening of additional routes, and more.\"",
      "It said recent reports of civilians being harmed approaching GHF hubs were \"being examined by the relevant IDF authorities\" and that \"any allegation of a deviation from the law or IDF directives will be thoroughly examined, and further action will be taken as necessary.\"",
      "In a joint statement on Friday, Netanyahu and Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz also said the \"State of Israel strongly rejects the despicable blood libels published in the newspaper 'Haaretz.'\"",
      "In response to the Haaretz article, a GHF spokesperson told CBS News on Friday that there had \"been no incidents or fatalities at or in the immediate vicinity of any of our distribution sites. However, IDF is tasked with providing safe passage for aid-seekers to all humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza, including GHF. GHF is not aware of any of these incidents but these allegations are too grave to ignore and we therefore call on Israel to investigate them and transparently publish the results in a timely manner.\"",
      "GHF boss dismisses criticism as \"disinformation\"",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore, an evangelical preacher twice appointed by President Trump as a White House adviser on religious freedoms, told Britain's Sky News on Friday that there was a \"disinformation campaign\" that is \"meant to shut down our efforts\" in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Hamas is intentionally harming people for the purpose of defaming what we're doing,\" he said, adding that the \"U.S. endorsement of the effort is Exhibit A that it is actually working, despite the disinformation campaign that is very, very deliberate, meant to shut down our efforts.\"",
      "Moore suggested that violence could not be avoided around its hubs in Gaza, as the small, densely populated Palestinian territory remains an active warzone.",
      "Sky cited a U.N. figure of 410 people killed near aid hubs in Gaza, slightly lower than the figure provided by the health ministry.",
      "In a social media post after his interview with Sky, Moore said that \"some associated with the UN (& others) are knowingly sharing info that cannot be independently verified, & they're doing so solely for political purposes\u2026 while claiming impartiality. GHF is not political. It just has one mission: feed Gaza.\"",
      "\"The key piece of disinformation is, every single day, some figure comes out from the Gaza Health Ministry. It's normally shared with a network like Al-Jazeera, and it sort of like, goes around the world,\" he told Sky, when asked specifically what disinformation he was referring to.",
      "Moore drew a distinction between the GHF's operations and those of the Israel military.",
      "\"The difference between, you know, what happens when the IDF is involved in an incident \u2014 and we're not denying that there have been those incidents, there have been those incidents \u2014 but we're able to talk to the IDF, the IDF does an investigation, and the IDF is a professionalized military,\" Moore said. \"Hamas is intentionally harming people for the purpose of defaming what we're doing.\"",
      "The IDF has issued repeated statements after reports of troops firing on unarmed Palestinian civilians seeking aid, saying it has launched investigations. The results of any investigations related to incidents near GHF hubs have yet to be made public by the IDF.",
      "\"They go to get food, but end up being killed.\"",
      "A number of Palestinians have told CBS News' team in Gaza about experiences of violence near GHF distribution sites.",
      "In early June, the family of Reem Akhras, a mother of eight, told CBS News' team in Gaza at her funeral that she was shot on her way to retrieve an aid parcel from a GHF hub.",
      "\"You went to get us food, Mom,\" Akhras' young daughter cried, sobbing over her body. \"We will never forgive them.\"",
      "\"They go to get food, but end up being killed,\" a man at Gaza's Nasser Hospital \u2014 where many of the injured were taken after an incident near a GHF hub in southern Gaza this week \u2014 told CBS News. \"They come with empty bags, and the American security company along with the Israeli army, they shoot these young men.\"",
      "The man said 30 people were killed on that day trying to reach the GHF hub.",
      "\"I tell everybody: Don't go. I send a message to all those young men: Do not go. Families should not send their children. Those who go will die. It's a trap. Stop going there. And if your son insists on going, break his legs. Do not go there.\"",
      "Another man at the hospital told CBS News that people have died \"in every family. They were just going to get food. They are hungry, grieving. They've got nothing to eat. Nothing to drink. There's no life. No safety. There's none of that in Gaza.\"",
      "The man said he wished the rest of the world could understand the suffering of people in Gaza.",
      "\"Young men in their prime are dying. What brings these youngsters to go to the aid sites? It's hunger. The fire of hunger has ravaged the people.\"",
      "GHF declines to reveal other backers",
      "Asked why the GHF was not being more transparent about its funding, organization and management, Moore declined to give further information about those matters, instead noting the group's daily press release to news organizations that lists the number of meals it says it has distributed and other \"operations on the ground.\"",
      "The GHF has been surrounded by controversy from the moment it commenced operations in mid-May. Just days after it launched its operation in Gaza, the group's first executive director, American Jake Wood,\u00a0announced his resignation, saying it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. GHF then said it was winding down its operation in Switzerland after Swiss authorities said it was breaching rules for foundations registered in that country.",
      "GHF told CBS News at the time that henceforth, its only operations would be based out of the United States.",
      "\"We're saying everything we can, every single day, and by the way, we promise to do more of that,\" Moore said on Friday when pressed by Sky News about where the organization's funding comes from and what other entities it works with directly. \"One of the reasons we haven't released some pieces of information is because of this amazing, amazing opposition to any effort whatsoever to do this differently.\"",
      "Moore repeated the GHF's insistence that only its method of aid distribution in Gaza was viable, as the only other way meant that \"virtually every piece of aid that comes into the Gaza Strip is immediately taken by armed gangs, by Hamas.\"",
      "Other aid agencies, and officials in the Hamas-run enclave, acknowledge that looting does happen, but they refute claims of large-scale aid theft or diversion, saying the primary challenge to distributing food in Gaza is Israeli forces not permitting those operations.",
      "On June 11, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was asked by CBS News' partner network BBC News if the State Department was funding GHF.",
      "\"It is not currently being funded largely by the U.S.,\" he said at the time. \"There are other countries, there are NGOs, there are humanitarian funds, and there are private individuals who have funded it, all of which have requested to remain anonymous. I think they don't want to become the targets of the hate that has befitted those who have tried to do something positive in what is a very difficult situation.\"",

      "The U.S. and China have agreed on the framework for a trade deal, both nations say.",
      "President Trump said at a White House event Thursday that Washington and Beijing had signed an agreement on trade, adding that he expects to have a deal with India soon. But Beijing and the White House later referred to the development as an agreement on the framework for a deal.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg TV the deal was signed earlier this week. Neither Lutnick nor Mr. Trump provided any details about the accord.",
      "\"We just signed with China the other day,\" the president said.",
      "Lutnick said the deal was \"signed and sealed\" two days earlier.",
      "Rare earth minerals apparently at center stage",
      "It was unclear if the latest accord was different from the one Mr. Trump announced two weeks earlier that he said would make it easier for American industries to obtain much-needed magnets and rare earth minerals. That pact cleared the way for the trade talks to continue, while the U.S. agreed to stop trying to revoke visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that the two sides had \"further confirmed the details of the framework.\" But its statement didn't explicitly mention U.S. access to rare earths, minerals essential for hi-tech products such as defense equipment, electric vehicles and hard drives. China dominates world production of those minerals.",
      "\"China will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\" the ministry said.",
      "The agreement follows initial talks in Geneva in early May that led both sides to postpone massive tariff hikes that were threatening to freeze much trade between the two countries. Later talks in London set a framework for negotiations and the deal mentioned by Mr. Trump appeared to formalize that agreement.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Thursday that the Trump administration and China had \"agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.\"",
      "That clarification came after the Trump announcement of a \"deal\" at the White House event, at which he urged Republican lawmakers to approve the mammoth tax and budget bill before Congress.",
      "China hasn't announced any new agreements, but said earlier this week that it was speeding up approvals of exports of rare earths. Beijing's limits on rare earths exports have been a key point of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing was accelerating review of export license applications for rare earths and had approved \"a certain number of compliant applications.\"",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington after China imposed permit requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Fentanyl another key in the trade talks",
      "China also has taken steps recently on the fentanyl issue, announcing last week that it would designate two more substances as precursor chemicals for fentanyl, making them subject to production, transport and export regulations. Mr. Trump has demanded that Beijing do more to stop the flow of such precursor ingredients to Mexican drug cartels, which use them to make fentanyl for sale in the U.S. He imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports over the fentanyl issue, the biggest part of current 30% across-the-board taxes on Chinese goods.",
      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Mr. Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",
      "U.S., China economies both feeling trade disputes' effects",
      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Mr. Trump could impose tariffs on them.",
      "In China, factory profits sank more than 9% from a year earlier in May, with automakers suffering a large share of that drop. They fell more than 1% year-on-year in January-May.",

      "Washington \u2014 Some Senate Democrats cast doubt on the Trump administration's characterization of the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities after top officials briefed senators Thursday.",
      "In recent days, President Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" after three nuclear sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. Meanwhile, an initial classified assessment found that the strikes set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Democrats questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "\"You cannot bomb knowledge out of existence \u2014 no matter how many scientists you kill,\" Murphy added. \"There are still people in Iran who how to work centrifuges.

      "\"Certainly, this mission was successful insofar as it extensively destroyed and perhaps severely damaged and set back the Iranian nuclear arms program. But how long and how much really remains to be determined by the intelligence community itself,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina stood behind the administration's characterization, but acknowledged that Iran's capabilities could eventually be restored.",
      "\"The real question is, have we obliterated their desire to have a nuclear weapon,\" Graham said after the classified briefing. \"I don't want people to think that the site wasn't severely damaged or obliterated. It was. But having said that, I don't want people to think the problem is over, because it's not.\"",
      "Graham said he believed the program had been set back by years. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said he was confident \"it's been set way back \u2014 a year, at minimum.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the strikes \"effectively destroyed Iran's nuclear program.\" Cotton added that the initial assessment had several intelligence gaps and \"assumed the worst-case scenario with perfect conditions in Iran.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 07:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Takahiro Shiraishi was executed for the killings in 2017 of nine victims, most of whom had posted suicidal thoughts on social media.",
    "story": [
      "Japan on Friday executed a man dubbed the \"Twitter killer\" who murdered and dismembered nine people he met online, in the nation's first enactment of the death penalty since 2022.",
      "Takahiro Shiraishi, 34, was hanged for killing his young victims, all but one of whom were women, after contacting them on the social media platform now called X.",
      "He had targeted users who posted about taking their own life, telling them he could help them in their plans, or even die alongside them.",
      "According to the BBC, his Twitter profile contained the words: \"I want to help people who are really in pain. Please DM [direct message] me anytime.\"",
      "He killed the three teenage girls and five women after raping them. He also killed the boyfriend of one of the women to silence him, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Justice Minister Keisuke Suzuki said Shiraishi's crimes, carried out in 2017, included \"robbery, rape, murder ... destruction of a corpse and abandonment of a corpse.\"",
      "\"Nine victims were beaten and strangled, killed, robbed, and then mutilated with parts of their bodies concealed in boxes, and parts discarded in a garbage dump,\" Suzuki told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Nine dismembered bodies were found in coolers and tool boxes when officers visited his flat, which was dubbed by media outlets as a \"house of horrors,\" the BBC reported.",
      "Shiraishi acted to satisfy \"his own sexual and financial desires\" and the murders \"caused great shock and anxiety to society,\" Suzuki said.",
      "\"After much careful consideration, I ordered the execution.\"",
      "Japan and the United States are the only two G7 countries to still use capital punishment, and there is strong support for the practice among the Japanese public, surveys show.",
      "There was one execution in 2022, three in 2021, three in 2019 and 15 in 2018, the justice ministry told AFP.",
      "Shiraishi was sentenced to death in 2020 for the murders of his nine victims, aged between 15 and 26.",
      "After luring them to his small home near the capital, he stashed parts of their bodies around the apartment in coolers and toolboxes sprinkled with cat litter in a bid to hide the evidence.",
      "His lawyers had argued Shiraishi should receive a prison sentence rather than be executed because his victims had expressed suicidal thoughts and so had consented to die.",
      "But a judge dismissed that argument, calling Shiraishi's crimes \"cunning and cruel,\" reports said at the time.",
      "\"The dignity of the victims was trampled upon,\" the judge had said, adding that Shiraishi had preyed upon people who were \"mentally fragile.\"",
      "The grisly murders were discovered in autumn 2017 by police investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman who had reportedly tweeted about wanting to kill herself.",
      "Her brother gained access to her Twitter account and eventually led police to Shiraishi's residence, where investigators found dismembered body parts.",
      "Executions in Japan",
      "Executions are always done by hanging in Japan, where around 100 death row prisoners are waiting for their sentences to be carried out.",
      "Nearly half are seeking a retrial, Suzuki said Friday.",
      "Executions are carried out in secrecy, where prisoners are not even informed of their fate until the morning of their hanging, according to the AP.",
      "Japanese law stipulates that executions must be carried out within six months of a verdict after appeals are exhausted.",
      "In reality, however, most inmates are left on tenterhooks in solitary confinement for years, and sometimes decades.",
      "There is widespread criticism of the system and the government's lack of transparency over the practice.",
      "Shiraishi's execution was the first under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's administration, the Japan Times reported.",
      "In 2022, Tomohiro Kato was hanged for an attack that killed seven people in 2008, when he rammed a rented two-ton truck into a crowd in Tokyo and went on a stabbing spree.",
      "The high-profile executions of the guru Shoko Asahara and 12 former members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult took place in 2018.",
      "Aum Shinrikyo orchestrated the 1995 sarin gas attacks on Tokyo's subway system, killing 14 people and sickening thousands more.",

      "The Jalisco cartel has been accused of using fake job advertisements to lure new members and of\u00a0torturing and killing recruits\u00a0who resist.

    "story": [
      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \"Mission: Impossible\" and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",
      "In addition to his sons, he's survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas Villamar, a fugitive drug trafficker known as Fito and wanted by authorities in Ecuador and the United States, was recaptured more than a year after he escaped from prison in the Andean nation, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced Wednesday.",
      "Mac\u00edas, who led a gang called \"Los Choneros\" in Ecuador, was captured in the Ecuadorian city of Manta, his hometown, officials in Ecuador said. In April, He was indicted in New York City on charges he imported thousands of pounds of cocaine into the United States.",
      "\"More will fall, we will reclaim the country. No truce,\" Noboa said in an X post announcing Mac\u00edas' arrest. \"We have done our part to proceed with Fito's extradition to the United States, we are awaiting their response.\"",
      "Interpol had issued an arrest warrant for Macias after his mysterious prison escape in early 2024 from the Guayaquil Regional Prison, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for drug trafficking. Ecuadorian authorities have yet to explain how he escaped from one of the country's notoriously violent prisons. They only learned of his escape when a military contingent arrived to transfer him to another maximum-security prison but didn't find him in his cell.",
      "The Ecuadorian army confirmed Macias' recapture in what appeared to be the basement of a house. A video provided by the army showed the moment of the arrest, with a uniformed officer aiming a gun at the head of the drug trafficker, who gave his full name. The officers had found him hiding in a small hole beneath what appeared to be a kitchen counter.",
      "Wednesday's announcement of his arrest comes in the same week that Federico G\u00f3mez, alias \"Fede,\" the leader of another gang called Las Aguilas, was confirmed to have escaped from an Ecuadorian prison.",
      "Last year, U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a news release that Macias led Los Choneros and its \"network of assassins and drug and weapon traffickers\" since at least 2020.",
      "With an extensive criminal record including charges of murder and organized crime, Mac\u00edas has cultivated a cult status among fellow gang members and the public in his home country.",
      "While behind bars in 2023, he released a video addressed to \"the Ecuadorian people\" while flanked by armed men. He also threw parties in prison, where he had access to everything from liquor to roosters for cockfighting matches. He also had been running Los Choneros from his jail cell, authorities allege.",
      "Mac\u00edas' escape \"triggered widespread riots, bombings, kidnappings, the assassination of a prominent prosecutor, and an armed attack on a TV network during a live broadcast,\" the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Ecuador said last year.",
      "The Ecuadorian government and drug mafias also declared war on each other, and Noboa gave orders to \"neutralize\" criminal gangs after\u00a0gunmen stormed and opened fire in the TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces.",
      "The seven-count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn charges Mac\u00edas and an unidentified co-defendant with international cocaine distribution, conspiracy and weapons counts, including smuggling firearms from the United States.",
      "Los Choneros employed people to buy firearms, components and ammunition in the United States and smuggle them into Ecuador, according to the indictment. Cocaine would flow into the United States with the help of Mexican cartels.",
      "\"Los Choneros operated a vast network responsible for the shipment and distribution of multi-ton quantities of cocaine from South America through Central America and Mexico to the United States and elsewhere,\" the indictment says.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Authorities in Ecuador have classified the gang as a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, the Ecuadorian government announced the reward for the capture of Mac\u00edas would be increased to\u00a0$1 million."

    "summary": "U.S. intel agencies say Iran's nuclear program is in tatters. Israel killed 30 Iranian military commanders. But Iran's supreme leader has a different take on the 12-day war.",
    "story": [
      "\"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" a message posted Thursday on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's X account declared. Another post added the bold claim that Israel's government \"was practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "In a recorded video address to his nation \u2014 his first public remarks since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire with Israel took effect on Tuesday \u2014 Khamenei went further, suggesting a \"large number of military and other targets\" in Israel had been targeted by Iran's missiles.",
      "They may have been targeted, but in reality, Iran's 12 days of missile launches saw relatively few rockets evade Israel's air defenses. A total of 28 people were killed, and none of them have been identified as government officials, but rather civilians killed when missiles struck apartment buildings and cities.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran killed at least 30 military commanders, on the other hand, and, in combination with the U.S. strikes over the weekend, \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear program, according to President Trump. The U.S.-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran, which relies on a network of sources in the country, said Wednesday that the strikes had killed at least 1,054 people in Iran, including a total of 318 military personnel.",
      "Khamenei also claimed Iran had given \"the U.S. a big slap in the face\" by attacking the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which is home to thousands of American forces.",
      "But none of the roughly dozen missiles Iran fired at the sprawling base hit it. They were intercepted, despite the ayatollah's assertion of \"lots of damage\" to the site.",
      "Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani met with CBS News at her offices in Tehran on Thursday and said Iran would continue to pursue its nuclear program.",
      "\"We had no intention to move towards a nuclear bomb,\" Mohajerani said. \"It's Israel that has 90 nuclear warheads, but we did not want to go that way. Nonetheless, we will obtain the scientific knowledge to do what we want with our program.\"",
      "Assessing Iran's nuclear program, and cooperation with the IAEA",
      "While full assessments of the damage inflicted are still being compiled, the heads of two U.S. intelligence agencies said Wednesday that\u00a0\"new\" intelligence indicated\u00a0the Iranian nuclear enrichment program was likely set back by \"years.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier Wednesday that the country's own intelligence assessment showed Iran's nuclear program was put back \"many years.\"",
      "Khamenei offered a very different take on Thursday \u2014 again, without any specifics or evidence. He claimed the U.S. had joined in Israel's strikes \"as it felt if it did not do so, the Zionist regime would get totally annihilated, so they entered the war to prevent this.\"",
      "\"They did not manage to do anything important to our nuclear facilities,\" he claimed, adding that Mr. Trump had \"overplayed the whole thing.\"",
      "Mohajerani on Thursday acknowledged to CBS News that the nuclear sites targeted by the U.S. strikes \"have been seriously damaged,\" adding, \"Any further reports should come from technical experts in the field.\"",
      "When pressed on the possibility the sites were completely destroyed, Mohajerani responded: \"I want to stress that these facilities have been seriously damaged. However, we must wait for the reports of our technical experts and specialists.\"",
      "Iran, in the wake of the ceasefire, has adopted legislation that will effectively forbid the country's government from cooperating in any way with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency has for decades been the only outside entity given access to Iran's nuclear facilities, for monitoring purposes, and it has experts still in the country.",
      "Iranian state media said Thursday that the legislation was approved by the senior clerics of the Guardian Council and thus had the \"weight of law.\" Khamenei, who has the ultimate say on all matters in Iran, did not mention the IAEA in his video address on Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told a\u00a0French news podcast that the agency's assessment, based largely on photographic evidence and its unique and deep familiarity with Iran's nuclear sites, was that the U.S. and Israeli strikes had caused \"very significant physical damage to three sites: Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordo, where Iran had concentrated most of its activities related to uranium enrichment and conversion.\"",
      "He said he was still in communication with senior Iranian officials and had suggested a meeting with the country's foreign minister, \"to begin evaluating the arrangements for the [IAEA] inspectors' return to the [nuclear] sites.\"",
      "Grossi said he had yet to receive any reply, noting \"some tension right now\" between the agency and Iran's leadership, given \"political voices in Iran who believe the agency hasn't been impartial.\"",
      "The IAEA chief said he was \"enormously\" concerned by the Iranian government's decision to halt cooperation with the IAEA.",
      "\"The agency's presence in Iran is not some kind of generous gesture. It is an international responsibility. Iran is a member of the\u00a0Non-Proliferation Treaty and therefore must have an inspection system. It is a legal obligation from the point of view of international law, which cannot be suspended unilaterally,\" Grossi said. \"I hope that will not be the case, because otherwise we would be on the verge of a new major crisis.\"",
      "Anxiety in Iran fueling the ayatollah's claims?",
      "Khamenei's remarks on Thursday were heavy on rhetorical flourish and virtually devoid of any facts, and they may have been aimed more at Iran's people than the wider world.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers, who swept to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled a pro-Western government led by the royal family of the shah, have long maintained tight control over all media in the country, and many Iranians have little access to outside information.",
      "Still, especially among younger, more tech-savvy generations, there is an understanding of the degree to which Iran's people do not enjoy the freedoms that many other countries guarantee \u2014 and it has led to several popular protest uprisings over the last decade. All of them have been brutally quashed by the authorities, but Netanyahu called very quickly after Israel started bombing Iran for new anti-government protests in the country, urging Iranians to take advantage of the attacks, which he said had put the ayatollah in his weakest position ever.",
      "Khamenei has yet to be seen live or in public since the ceasefire, and his precise whereabouts remained unclear Thursday after the pre-recorded video message was released.",
      "While the ceasefire enabled Israelis to revel on Wednesday in a return to normalcy, with the lifting of 12 days of war-time security measures, in Tehran, anxiety still appeared rife.",
      "CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab and his team were granted Iranian visas to enter the country earlier in the week, and they were the first American broadcast network to enter Tehran since the war began. But it took them an arduous journey through arid landscapes and across the border from Turkey to reach Iran's capital, as the country's airspace had been closed.",
      "Tyab said the Iranian capital felt very different this week compared to his previous visit about five years earlier, when, despite the government's authoritarian control over daily life, it was a vibrant metropolis. On Thursday, despite the truce, most businesses remained shut, and the sense of nervousness was palpable.",
      "Imtiaz  Tyab\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Wander Franco was accused of having a relationship with a girl who was 14 at the time, and of transferring thousands of dollars to her mother to consent to the illegal relationship.",
    "story": [
      "Wander Franco, the suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop charged in a sexual abuse case, was found guilty on Thursday in the Dominican Republic but received a two-year suspended sentence.",
      "Franco was arrested last year after being accused of having a four-month relationship with a girl who was 14 at the time, and of transferring thousands of dollars to her mother to consent to the illegal relationship.",
      "Franco, now 24, also faced charges of sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking, but was found not guilty of those.",
      "Judge Jakayra Veras Garc\u00eda said Franco made a bad decision as she addressed him during the ruling.",
      "\"Look at us, Wander,\" she said. \"Do not approach minors for sexual purposes. If you don't like people very close to your age, you have to wait your time.\"",
      "Prosecutors had requested a five-year prison sentence against Franco and a 10-year sentence against the girl's mother, who was found guilty and will serve the full term.",
      "\"Apparently she was the one who thought she was handling the bat in the big leagues,\" Veras said of the mother and her request that Franco pay for her daughter's schooling and other expenses.",
      "Franco's attorney, Irina Ventura, said she would appeal the judge's ruling: \"Evidently, justice was not done.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutor Luis Mart\u00ednez said he was pleased with the rulings but did not say whether the government would appeal.",
      "Before the three judges issued their unanimous ruling, Veras orally reviewed the copious amount of evidence that prosecutors presented during trial, including certain testimony from 31 witnesses.",
      "\"This is a somewhat complex process,\" Veras said.",
      "More than an hour into her presentation, Veras said: \"The court has understood that this minor was manipulated.\"",
      "As the judge continued her review, Franco looked ahead expressionless, leaning forward at times.",
      "Franco, who was once the team's star shortstop, had signed a $182 million, 11-year contract through 2032 in November 2021 but saw his career abruptly halted in August 2023 after authorities in the Dominican Republic announced they were investigating him for an alleged relationship with a minor. Franco was 22 at the time.",
      "In January 2024, authorities arrested Franco in the Dominican Republic. Six months later, Tampa Bay placed him on the restricted list, which cut off the pay he had been receiving while on administrative leave.",
      "He was placed on that list because he has not been able to report to the team and would need a new U.S. visa to do so.",
      "While Franco awaited trial on conditional release, he was arrested again in November last year following what Dominican authorities called an altercation over a woman's attention. He was charged with illegally carrying a semiautomatic Glock 19 that police said was registered to his uncle.",
      "That case is still pending in court.",
      "After the ruling, Major League Baseball issued a brief statement noting it had collectively bargained a joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy \"that reflects our commitment to these issues.\"",
      "\"We are aware of today's verdict in the Wander Franco trial and will conclude our investigation at the appropriate time,\" MLB said.",

    "summary": "North Korea's Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone has hotels and other accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests.",
    "story": [
      "North Korea next week will open a signature coastal tourist site that it says will usher in a new era in its tourism industry, though there is no word on when the country will fully reopen to foreign visitors.",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone has hotels and other accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests who can swim in the sea, engage in sports and recreation activities and eat at restaurants and cafeterias on site, state media said.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un toured the site and cut the inaugural tape at a lavish ceremony Tuesday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported Thursday.",
      "Kim said its construction would be recorded as \"one of the greatest successes this year\" and called the site \"the proud first step\" toward realizing the government's policy of developing tourism, according to KCNA.",
      "North Korea will open the site to domestic tourists first",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma beach resort is North Korea's biggest tourist site. KCNA said North Korea will begin service for domestic tourists next Tuesday. It didn't say when North Korea will start receiving foreign tourists, but Russian officials said later Thursday that the first Russian tour to the site will happen in July.",
      "Observers say the resort likely required a huge investment from North Korea's limited budget, so it eventually will have to accept Chinese and other foreign tourists too to break even.",
      "Kim has been pushing to make the country a tourism hub as part of efforts to revive the ailing economy, and the Wonsan-Kalma zone is one of his most talked-about tourism projects. KCNA reported North Korea will confirm plans to build large tourist sites in other parts of the country, too.",
      "But North Korea hasn't fully lifted a ban on foreign tourists that it imposed in early 2020 to guard against the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say North Korea has been slow to resume its international tourism because of remaining pandemic curbs, a flare-up of tensions with the U.S. and South Korea in recent years and worries about Western tourists spreading a negative image of its system.",
      "Russian tourists expected soon",
      "Russia's Primorsky region, which borders North Korea, said that the first group of Russian tourists to the resort will depart on July 7. The region's press service said that during their eight-day trip, Russian tourists will also have an opportunity to visit major attractions in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, according to Russian state news agency Tass.",
      "Starting from February 2024, North Korea has already been accepting Russian tourists to other areas amid the booming military and other partnerships between the two countries, but Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled.",
      "In February this year, a small group of international tourists visited North Korea for the first time in five years, but tourist agencies said in March that their tours to North Korea were paused.",
      "Kim's recent foreign policy prioritizes relations with Russia as he's been supplying troops and conventional weapons to support its war against Ukraine in return for economic and military assistance. But North Korea's ties with China, which has long been its biggest trading partner and aid benefactor, have apparently cooled as China is reluctant to join an anti-Western alliance with North Korea and Russia, analysts say.",
      "Tuesday's ceremony that marked the completion of the resort's construction drew the Russian ambassador to North Korea and his embassy staff, KCNA said. But it didn't say whether any Chinese diplomats were also invited.",
      "\"There seems to be issues that North Korea hasn't yet resolved in its relations with China. But North Korea has put in too much money on tourism and plans to spend more. Subsequently, to get its money's worth, North Korea can't help receiving Chinese tourists,\" Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's intelligence agency.",
      "Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University's Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, also said that foreign tourism to the Wonsan-Kalma site will begin with Russians. But he said Chinese tours to the zone, a sort of civilian exchange, will also begin soon, adding bilateral trade between China and North Korea has been recovering.",
      "South Korean and American tours won't likely happen soon",
      "Lim said that South Korean and American tours to North Korea won't likely restart anytime soon, though both new liberal South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Trump have expressed hopes to revive dialogue with North Korea.",
      "In January, when Mr. Trump boasted about his ties with Kim, he said \"I think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He's got a lot of shoreline,\" a likely reference to Wonsan-Kalma.",
      "North Korea hasn't publicly responded to Mr. Trump's outreach. It has repeatedly rejected Washington and Seoul's dialogue offers and focused on expanding its nuclear weapons program since Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Mr. Trump collapsed in 2019.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-us-funding-gavi-vaccine-alliance-travesty-experts-warn/",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "President Trump says the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, as a\u00a0tenuous ceasefire\u00a0between Israel and Iran holds for now.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",
      "\"I don't care if I have an agreement or not,\" he said. \"The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about, 'we want no nuclear.' But we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr. Trump expressed optimism and said there's been \"great progress.\"",
      "\"I think great progress is being made on Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who complimented the president on his efforts to boost other countries' defense spending and on his efforts in the Middle East.",
      "\"You are a man of strength and also a man of peace,\" Rutte told Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said they discussed \"how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace deal.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the attention and the readiness to help bring peace close,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X, adding, \"Details will follow.\"",
      "The president said of his conversation with Zelenskyy, \"I took from the meeting that he'd like to see it end. I think it's a great time to end it. I'm going to speak to Vladimir Putin and see if we can get it ended.\"",
      "A Ukrainian BBC reporter, who said her husband is a soldier in Ukraine, asked the president whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with Patriot missile defense systems, which intercept ballistic missiles.",
      "\"They do want to have the anti-missile missiles \u2026 the Patriots,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"and we're going to see if we can make some available.\" He said the missiles were \"hard to get,\" and the U.S. has been providing them to Israel. \"They're very effective \u2014 100% effective.\"",
      "The president, upon learning that the reporter was living with her children in Warsaw while her husband fights in Ukraine, said, \"That's rough stuff, right?\" And after he answered her question, he wished her luck and offered his regards to her husband.",
      "NATO members, with the exceptions of Spain and Slovakia, have agreed to a dramatic increase in their defense spending, to 5% of GDP, a goal pressed by Mr. Trump, though the U.S. defense spending is short of that target. Before leaving for the summit, Mr. Trump said the U.S. shouldn't have to reach that target, since it's contributed so much to NATO in the past.",
      "\"This week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible,\" Mr. Trump said at his press conference, adding that it will be known as \"The Hague defense commitment.\"",
      "Asked about Spain's refusal to commit to the 5% threshold, Mr. Trump said he liked Spain and its people, \"But Spain is the only country \u2014 out of all other countries \u2014 that refuses to pay,\" and he said it was getting \"a little bit of a free ride.\" The president went on to say that the U.S. is negotiating with Spain on trade, and \"we're going to make them pay twice as much.\"",

      "The office of Israel's defense minister said Monday that the military was \"attacking with unprecedented force regime targets and government repression entities in the heart of Iran.\" It was the first time Israel has acknowledged striking targets linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, rather than its military or nuclear assets.",
      "The defense minister's office said the new targets included the notorious Evin Prison, where political prisoners are held, a clock in Tehran's Palestine Square that symbolically displays a countdown to the destruction of the state of Israel, and the headquarters of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces, which among other things acts as a morality police force for the Islamic rulers.",

      "But while Mr. Trump said in a social media post that the \"spectacular military success\" in Iran had taken \"the 'bomb' right out of their hands,\" The New York Times reported that the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, believed Iran could have moved at least some of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to another location before the U.S. attack, as Iranian officials have claimed.",
      "In remarks to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi did not mention that prospect specifically, but he said \"no one \u2014 including the IAEA \u2014 is in a position to assess the underground damage\" at\u00a0Iran's most sensitive site at Fordo, where the regime is believed to have carried out advanced enrichment work in secret.",
      "\"We must return to the negotiating table and allow the IAEA inspectors, the guardians of the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty], to go back to Iran's nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%,\" Grossi said, referring to the bulk of Iran's highly-enriched uranium, previously known to have been stored at the Isfahan facility. Uranium enriched to that level is only a short technical step away from the 90% purity required to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy. If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi warned the delegations at the U.N.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" it would take days to confirm whether Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved, but he thought it was unlikely.",
      "\"No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it, because you really can't move anything right now. They can't move anything right now inside Iran. The minute a truck starts driving anywhere the Israelis have seen it, and targeted it and taken it out. So our assessment is, we have to assume that \u2014 that's a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there at Isfahan. And that really is key. What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. Multiple countries in the world will take it and down-blend it. That's what they should do with that,\" Rubio said, adding another call for Iran to agree to abandon its enrichment work to end the crisis.",
      "Rubio said if Iran were to \"call right now, and say 'we wanna meet, let's talk about this,' we're prepared to do that. The president's made that clear from the very beginning. His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically.\"",
      "Trump hints at prospect of regime change in Iran",
      "Rubio also reiterated on Sunday President Trump's previous statements that the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites were carried out with the sole purpose of removing the threat of the regime obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"It was not attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move,\" Rubio said.",
      "Mr. Trump had, right after the U.S. strikes, said they would be the extent of America's involvement in the conflict unless Iran launched retaliatory attacks against U.S. assets in the region. But late on Sunday, in a social media post, Mr. Trump stoked concern about a possible further escalation of the conflict.",
      "\"If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked about the president's remarks on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking: If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks \u2014 we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know \u2014 but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night. But as far as far as our military posture, it has not been changed.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his top aids have also suggested in recent days that the military action taken by Israel could make room for an uprising in the Islamic Republic to topple Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime, and Netanyahu has called directly on Iranians to take to the streets.",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that Iran \"reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.\"",
      "Araghchi arrived Sunday evening in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has fostered closer ties with Iran for years.",
      "About 40,000 U.S. military personnel are deployed in the Middle East, on warships and bases across the region.",
      "Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement Sunday that \"the number, dispersion, and size of U.S. military bases in the region are not a strength, but have doubled their vulnerability.\"",
      "The U.S. State Department issued a new alert on Sunday, meanwhile, to Americans traveling anywhere outside of the country to \"exercise increased caution,\" due to the possibility of the strikes fueling anti-U.S. sentiment or protests.",

    "summary": "Kristina &quot;KK&quot; Khorram faces scrutiny in Diddy&apos;s sex trafficking trial after testimony revealed her alleged involvement in drug transportation and concealing assault evidence.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' Alexis McAdams reports the latest on the trial from New York City.",
      "Closing arguments in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial began Thursday, more than seven weeks after jurors were seated for the case. While the Bad Boy Records founder was the focus of the government's charges, his former chief of staff, Kristina (KK) Khorram, was brought up throughout witnesses' testimony, though she never testified nor was charged.",
      "KK was previously compared to Jeffrey Epstein's righthand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, in a lawsuit brought against her and Diddy in March 2024. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones claimed he witnessed KK ordering sex workers for Diddy. KK also had all the assistants keep drugs ready for Diddy at a moment's notice, according to Jones' allegations.",
      "\"From what we\u2019ve seen so far, the comparison between Kristina Khorram and Ghislaine Maxwell isn\u2019t really a fair one, given that Epstein\u2019s victims were underage girls,\" John J. Perlstein explained to Fox News Digital. \"Still, Khorram is an alleged co-conspirator in the Diddy case, so it makes sense that she wouldn\u2019t want to testify, as she would\u2019ve likely had to plead the Fifth.\"",
      "DIDDY BLOWS KISS TO FAMILY AFTER PROSECUTION PROMISES TO PUT A STOP TO HIS ALLEGED CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR",
      "Diddy was charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in an indictment unsealed in September. (Jordan Strauss)",
      "\"While Ghislaine Maxwell was not originally charged in the Jeffrey Epstein case, charges were eventually filed against her,\" the Los Angeles-based litigator added. \"That\u2019s likely what we see happening here with Khorram and the Diddy case. However, the criminal enterprise case against Diddy is extremely weak, and it\u2019s possible that the case against Khorram would be even weaker.\"",
      "During Diddy's sex trafficking and racketeering trial, prosecutors claimed the music mogul was the leader of the alleged criminal enterprise. His inner circle included his chief of staff, assistants and security.\u00a0Diddy's ex-girlfriend, Jane, testified KK was the rapper's \"righthand woman.\" The government claimed KK lived in Diddy's home in Miami and knew what he was doing all the time. She even allegedly responded to people from his phones.",
      "According to the prosecution, Diddy and his staff were involved in purchasing and distributing drugs. Jane testified that KK helped her transport drugs across state lines. KK was seemingly aware Diddy's assistants were purchasing drugs for the rapper. In texts shown during Brendan Paul's testimony, he asked KK for reimbursement.",

      "Diddy's former chief of staff was brought up in testimony from Cassie; Diddy's ex, Jane; and each of his former personal assistants. Text messages from KK were also entered into evidence in the trial. However, she never actually took the stand.",

      "\"You never call a witness or ask a question that you don't know,\" Becker, who worked on R. Kelly's case, told Fox News Digital. \"So, in this case, if no one was able to actually have these deep conversations with KK and know exactly what she was going to testify to, she could have actually been a thorn in the government's side.\"",

Now, the question becomes, 'Well, if KK is the one who was responsible for some of the very criminal activities that they're now putting on P. Diddy, why isn't she charged with the same types of crimes?'",
      "\"From a legal strategy standpoint, the big fish is who you go after,\" Becker added. \"Who's the big fish that the public knows? Who is the hip-hop mogul that we all know of? Well, it's not KK. Who is it? It's the face. And so the government wants to be firm that the face of the enterprise is the individual who gets in trouble.\"",

      "Lawyers on both sides of the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial hammered down instructions Wednesday for the jury to begin deliberations once closing arguments wrap up in the former record executive's federal trial for alleged sex crimes.",
      "Prior to a charge conference, prosecutors indicated in court they are not pursuing a number of allegations against the \"Victory\" rapper that pertain to a racketeering charge.",
      "The updated request from the government more than seven weeks after the trial began gave pause for concern about the status of the case.

      "\"In order to find Diddy guilty of RICO, the jury has to find him guilty of at least two underlying crimes in connection with the alleged criminal enterprise, Bad Boy Entertainment,\" Faddis told Fox News Digital. \"This move by the prosecution significantly limits the underlying crimes the jury can consider in deciding if Diddy is guilty of RICO, thereby reducing the scope of the RICO charge and the case more generally. All things considered, I think it makes it less likely that Diddy will be found guilty of RICO.\"",

      "\"Specifically, the Government has removed instructions from the charge relating to (i) attempted kidnapping under both California and New York law, (ii) attempted arson under California law, and (iii) aiding and abetting sex trafficking. The Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability so instructions are no longer necessary.\"",
      "The simplified charges could help \"streamline the deliberations and cause the jury to focus\" on only the RICO crimes, Faddis said.",

      "\"On the other hand, it could damage the government\u2019s credibility, as they promised this jury at the beginning of trial that they could prove crimes they now are dismissing,\" Faddis noted. \"The jury might feel misled, see this is a partial surrender and view the remaining allegations with even more skepticism.\"",

      "\"The same applies to the sex trafficking counts. The government is arguing that Diddy sex trafficked the victims, not that he aided and embedded others to do so. The prosecution is just simplifying the charges for the jury to avoid confusion. This doesn't really change anything, and the legal arguments they're going to make during closing will remain the same.\"",

      "A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence per charge, the U.S. Code 2421 transportation charge can carry a sentence of up to 10 years and U.S. Code 2422 Coercion and enticement may carry a 20-year sentence. Each of the violations may also include monetary fines.",
      "Diddy was arrested and charged with multiple counts in September. (Shareif Ziyadat)",

      "But according to experts, this isn\u2019t inevitable. Dental professionals shared the following tips to prevent tooth loss and boost overall health.",
      "1. Protect gum health",
      "About two in three adults over age 65 are dealing with some form of gum disease, according to a recently published AARP report.",
      "6 SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",
      "Clinical experts cited in the report, including Dr. Uchenna Akosa, assistant professor and director at Rutgers Health University Dental Associates in New Jersey, warn that bleeding gums can signal a much deeper problem.",

      "The publication also points to previous research linking gum disease to other health risks, such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.",
      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth.",
      "Experts recommend focusing on early prevention. If your gums bleed when brushing, or if you notice sensitivity or recession, those are signs to schedule a dental visit.",

      "\"It\u2019s especially valuable for patients with arthritis, limited mobility or trouble using traditional floss,\" Frey told Fox News Digital.",
      "2. Take steps to prevent dry mouth",
      "Saliva plays an essential role in neutralizing acids and protecting tooth enamel, but dry mouth affects nearly six in 10 older adults, according to AARP.",
      "Many common medications \u2014 including antihistamines, antidepressants and blood pressure drugs \u2014 can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to tooth decay, infection and gum disease, WebMD states.",
      "IS OZEMPIC RUINING YOUR TEETH? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT IMPACT ON DENTAL HEALTH",
      "To prevent dry mouth, AARP recommends sipping water regularly, rinsing the mouth after eating, asking your dentist about prescription-strength fluoride toothpaste, and using dry mouth rinses like Biotene or Act.",
      "3. Personalize your dental visits",
      "Contrary to the standard six-month checkup rule, AARP notes that dental care schedules should be personalized.",
      "One doctor in the report noted that there\u2019s \"nothing magical about a six-month checkup\" \u2014 some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits.",
      "The recommended frequency of dental visits is not one-size-fits-all, according to AARP. Some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits. (iStock)",
      "Oral health issues in older adults often go unnoticed, especially those related to bite alignment, according to Frey.",
      "\"Bite-related issues are often an overlooked source of headaches and neck pain,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The public simply hasn\u2019t been informed that tension, misalignment and jaw dysfunction can manifest in ways that seem unrelated at first glance.\"",

      "4. Explore options for financial help",
      "Only three in 10 adults over 65 have dental insurance, per the American Dental Association, and Medicare may not cover all necessary procedures.",
      "Many common medications can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to decay, experts say. (iStock)",
      "This financial gap often leads people to skip dental care altogether, which can cause more serious (and expensive) problems in the future.",
      "AARP suggests looking into dental savings plans, local dental schools or sliding-scale community clinics if coverage is an issue.",
      "5. Adopt healthy habits",
      "Smoking is a major contributor to tooth loss.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all their teeth than non-smokers.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all of their teeth than non-smokers. (iStock)",
      "And while sugary cough drops or hard candies may seem harmless, they can be damaging to tooth enamel over time, experts warn.",
      "Switching to sugar-free gum or candies containing xylitol may help prevent cavities and support better oral health, Akosa told AARP.",
      "6. Restore appearance",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions about aging and dental health is that worn, discolored teeth are something to simply accept, according to Frey.",
      "\"It\u2019s not just about revitalizing the teeth \u2014 it\u2019s about revitalizing the person.\"",
      "\"A delicate, thin porcelain veneer can restore the vitality, color and shape your teeth once had, enhancing your smile and overall appearance,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "It is important that the surgeon goes over these risks with the patient in person, according to Davis.",

      "Watch out for this Zelle scam on facebook marketplace. Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains why.",
      "It started with a Facebook friend request and a message that felt too good to be true.",
      "Then,\u00a0it quickly turned into an expensive lesson in online deception.",
      "The woman this happened to in Jensen Beach, Florida, wrote us saying, \"He kept telling me it was my lucky day. I had just won a new white Tesla and $250,000 in cash. All I needed to do was send him an Apple Gift Card for $200. So I did. Well, $800 later, he wanted more to pay for the broken-down truck that was on its way to my house to deliver my winnings.\"",
      "The scammer, posing as Elon Musk, used flattery, fake urgency and a convincing profile to lure the victim into a carefully staged hoax. Behind the big promises was someone who walked away with hundreds of dollars in untraceable gift cards. Here\u2019s how the scam works and how you can avoid falling for it.",

      "A person trying a Tesla vehicle. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Elon Musk Tesla Facebook scam works",
      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account. But unfortunately, by then, the funds were already gone.",

      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES AND AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Why scammers prefer gift cards in online scams",
      "Gift cards are one of the most common tools used in scams because they are fast, anonymous, and nearly impossible to recover once the code is shared. Scammers often claim that the cards are needed to cover fees, unlock a prize or verify your identity. Once a scammer has the code, they can do a few things:",

      "Sell the card on online marketplaces at a discount",
      "Launder the funds through reselling sites or gaming platforms.",
      "Apple Gift Cards are frequently used because they are easy to find in stores and can be used for high-value digital purchases. But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

      "Other Elon Musk impersonation scams to know about",
      "Scams that impersonate celebrities or public figures have become increasingly common. Criminals use well-known names to create a false sense of trust and urgency. Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns. His name is widely associated with innovation, crypto and high-value giveaways, which makes him a perfect target for fraudsters trying to appear legitimate. Some of the most common Elon-related scams include:",
      "Energy-saving device scams: One scam used Musk\u2019s photo and fake testimonials to promote a suspicious energy product through Facebook ads. The ad was styled to look like a real news article, which made it harder to spot as a fake.\u00a0Read more about the energy-saving scam here.Fake investment opportunities: In one case, a scammer convinced a woman she was in a relationship with Musk and persuaded her to invest in a business venture. She lost over $26,000 before realizing it was a hoax.Crypto giveaway livestreams: These scams often appear on YouTube or in ads, claiming that Musk is hosting a giveaway. Victims are told to send cryptocurrency with the promise of getting double in return. In reality, the money is taken and never returned.",

      "What ties these scams together is the use of a familiar face to lower suspicion. The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins. Victims are asked to send money, act quickly and avoid telling anyone. If a message or ad involves a celebrity offering free money, discounted products or special access to a private opportunity, it is almost certainly a scam.",

      "These scams rely on quick decisions, emotional reactions and a false sense of trust. Slowing down and checking for warning signs can help you stay safe. Here are some practical steps:",
      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

In one case, a reader lost $800 after being promised a Tesla and $250,000 in cash, but only if they sent Apple Gift Cards first. These scams rely on trust, speed and celebrity recognition. The real Musk is not sending private messages to strangers. If someone contacts you about a prize and asks for money or gift cards, it is a scam.

      "Cybernews describes the exposed database as a \"blueprint for mass exploitation.\" The records include login credentials from popular platforms like Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",
      "BleepingComputer, a cybersecurity site that reviewed the archive, confirmed the data appears to be aggregated from older breaches rather than a fresh incident. This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",
      "Credential stuffing becomes much easier when attackers have access to such a vast pool of usernames and passwords. This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials. So, even if your account wasn't part of a recent breach, you could still be at risk if your old credentials are part of this newly indexed compilation.",

      "With credential leaks becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Infostealer malware often targets passwords saved directly in web browsers, making them easy targets. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Passwords are no longer enough. That is why I have always believed tech companies should phase them out entirely and require two-factor authentication across the board. Passwords, once the foundation of online identity, are now one of its weakest links. Companies like Google and Meta are already building systems that move beyond them. The tools are available.

      "How BeBot works: Tech specs and core features",
      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands.

In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites.

      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "According to Linda Garner-Bunch, managing editor of The\u00a0Trucker Media Group:",
      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.",

      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices after a 'massive security gap.'",
      "Cyberattacks on financial service providers are no longer isolated events. In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs. These attacks don\u2019t just disrupt operations but also expose deeply personal financial information that can fuel identity theft, fraud and long-term reputational damage.",
      "Now, Optima Tax Relief, one of the most prominent tax resolution firms in the U.S., has joined that growing list. A ransomware group called Chaos claims to have breached Optima\u2019s systems, stealing 69 GB of data before encrypting internal servers.",

      "The data stolen in the attack includes what appears to be corporate documents and sensitive customer case files. Tax documents are especially valuable to cybercriminals. They often contain Social Security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers and other identifiers that can be used to commit financial fraud or impersonation.",
      "Sources familiar with the incident told\u00a0BleepingComputer this was a double-extortion attack. That means Chaos not only stole the data but also encrypted Optima\u2019s systems, presumably demanding a ransom in exchange for access and non-disclosure.

      "6 ways you can stay safe from Optima data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

Nuclear proliferation is nonpartisan, and this was an apolitical win.\" Even after Iran struck a U.S. base in Qatar, he added, \"the President showed immense restraint and kept focus on the broader goal: preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and continuing its terror campaign.\"",
      "Despite the violence that followed the announcement \u2014 including an Iranian strike that killed four civilians in Israel \u2014 Spencer believes the ceasefire will hold. \"Both countries have now said we\u2019re absolutely going to do it,\" he said. \"And yes, President Trump is very atypical in the way he communicates with the ceasefire\u2026 with the \u2018don\u2019t drop a single bomb.\u2019\"",

      "\"Iran cannot win this war,\" said Danny Orbach, a military historian at Hebrew University. \"They\u2019ve lost roughly 60% of their launchers. Even if they still have around 1,000 long-range missiles, without enough functioning launchers, they can\u2019t deploy them effectively.\"",

      "\"The strike in Qatar was coordinated with the Americans and was not intended to impress or cause real harm,\" claimed Sima Shine, a former Mossad official and senior Iran expert at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies. \"Iran still has weapons, but it doesn\u2019t want to draw the U.S. into an all-out war. And they know closing the Strait of Hormuz will end badly for them.\"",
      "\"What has largely remained intact is Iran\u2019s short-range capability,\" said Blaise Misztal, vice president of policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). \"These are thousands of rockets, missiles, and drones that can\u2019t reach Israel, but can absolutely hit U.S. bases in Qatar, Iraq, Bahrain, and the UAE. That\u2019s what we saw in the strike on Al Udeid.\"",
      "Misztal added that Iran\u2019s remaining arsenal is \"well-developed and available in far greater quantities\" than its long-range weapons. \"The danger isn\u2019t just to U.S. forces. Iran can still target energy infrastructure, major cities, and commercial shipping across the Gulf.\"",

      "The justices in a 6-3 vote rejected a challenge brought by a pornography interest group called the Free Speech Coalition that said the measure violates the free speech rights of adults who want to access the content.",
      "The law requires users of websites that host adult content to verify their age before they can access it. This requires the operator to view a government-issued identification, such as a driver\u2019s license.",
      "The law \"simply requires established verification methods already in use by pornographic sites and other industries,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority.",
      "It also \"advances the state's important interest in shielding children from sexually explicit material,\" he added.",
      "The challengers argued the law violates the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment because it places a \u201ccontent-based burden\u201d on adults\u2019 access to speech.",
      "They cited a 2004 Supreme Court ruling that found a federal law also aimed at restricting access to pornography, called the Child Online Protection Act, was most likely unconstitutional.",
      "A federal judge had ruled that the provision at issue was problematic because it did not merely restrict access to minors.",
      "The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then ruled for Texas and refused to put its ruling on hold pending further review.",
      "As a result of that ruling, some online pornography platforms, including Pornhub, prevented people in Texas from accessing their sites out of concern about the provision\u2019s going into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court in April 2024 declined to block the law while the case continued."

      "The lawsuit, filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, claims Justin Combs, 31, used his father\u2019s celebrity status to lure the woman, only identified as \u201cJane Doe,\u201d to Los Angeles with promises of a TV job in 2017. Instead, she was \u201cheld prisoner for a weekend,\u201d given drugs and alcohol, and raped, the complaint claims.",
      "The suit was filed against Combs, his son Justin, and the music mogul\u2019s businesses Combs Enterprises LLC and Bad Boy Entertainment, claiming sexual assault and battery, gender violence, and negligent supervision. The lawsuit demands a jury trial and payment of damages, including for \u201cfuture and past lost earnings.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 media team denied the allegations in the suit in a statement Friday, saying: \u201cNo matter how many lawsuits are filed it won\u2019t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone\u2014man or woman, adult or minor.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth, and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail in court,\u201d the statement continued.",
      "In March or April 2017, Justin Combs allegedly contacted Jane Doe through Snapchat. The two messaged back and forth and had discussed her desire for a career in the entertainment industry, according to the complaint.",
      "The woman sent Justin \u201crisqu\u00e9 photos at Justin\u2019s request,\u201d the complaint said. That same day, Justin offered to fly her out to Los Angeles for the weekend, it said. She was living in New Orleans at the time.",
      "Justin said that the trip to Los Angeles would be helpful for her potential career and \u201che would get her a position with Remote TV in Atlanta through his and his father\u2019s connections,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "On April 14, 2017, Jane Doe flew to Los Angeles, was picked up with a black SUV and was taken to a house Justin called \u201cThe Glass House\u201d in Beverly Hills, the filing said.",
      "The complaint said Jane Doe was surprised that she and Justin remained in the home talking that night and the following day, which frustrated her as she thought they\u2019d go out.",
      "\u201cWhen asked if they were ever going to leave, Justin abruptly said \u2018no,\u2019\u201d the filing said.",
      "Justin ordered them liquor and marijuana, which Jane Doe believed was laced, the complaint said. He then offered her to take various pills or poppers throughout the day, it said.",
      "After she and Justin took the drugs, three other men arrived to the house, all wearing \u201cmasquerade masks,\u201d the filing said.",
      "Jane Doe recognized one of them as Sean Combs \u2014 \u201cdue in part to his stature and mannerisms but also because Justin referred to him on at least one occasion as \u2018Pops,\u2019\u201d the filing said. She did not recognize the other two.",
      "She was then taken to a bedroom upstairs and told, \u201cYou better let this happen. Or else,\u201d according to the filing.",
      "Then each man took turns raping Jane Doe as she was \u201cdrugged and incapacitated,\u201d the complaint claimed.",
      "\u201cThe brutal gang-rape of Plaintiff continued from Saturday evening through at least midday Sunday, with the three men continuing to take their turns abusing Plaintiff,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "On Monday, she was driven back to the airport and dropped off.",
      "Throughout the weekend and afterward Justin \u201cheld over Plaintiff\u2019s head the possibility of a job\u201d that never materialized, along with the photos she had sent to him on Snapchat \u201cwhich he had saved and could release at his pleasure,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "Jane Doe suffered severe emotional distress, fear, anxiety, physical injury and emotional injury and trauma from the ordeal, the filing said.",
      "The complaint accuses Sean and Justin Combs of committing sexual battery against Jane Doe; alleges Combs\u2019 businesses enabled and conspired with them to commit the battery in that Jane Doe was lured with the hope of a job; and alleges defendant Does 1 through 10 \u201chave enabled and conspired with Combs to commit the offending sexual battery.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also accuses Combs\u2019 businesses of negligent supervision in that the entities should have had knowledge of his conduct and \u201cdid nothing to stop it,\u201d the filing said.",
      "The suit comes as Combs\u2019 racketeering and sex trafficking trial in New York is underway with closing arguments to continue Friday.",
      "Combs has faced a slew of lawsuits in past years \u2014 including one filed and later settled by ex-girlfriend and singer Cassie Ventura \u2014 alleging sex trafficking, abuse and coercion, all of which he has vehemently denied.",
      "Combs\u2019 camp hasn\u2019t filed a response yet to the suit.",
      "Tony Buzbee, an attorney for Jane Doe, said Friday: \u201cWe are proud of our client for having the courage to step forward and be heard. The details of the lawsuit speak for themselves. We will see that justice is done.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump said Friday that he had terminated trade discussions with Canada, citing an incoming Canadian tax on tech companies including those based in the U.S.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump referred to Canada as \"a very difficult country to trade with\" and said that its levy on tech firms \u2014 the first payment for which is due Monday \u2014 \"is a direct and blatant attack on our Country.\"",
      "\"Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,\" he said. \"We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.\"",
      "The office of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Last week Canada\u2019s finance minister said that he would not delay implementation of the digital services tax \u2014 which applies to any tech company making more than $15 million from Canadian internet users \u2014 even as U.S. trade talks continue.",

      "Trump's post cuts short what had been a relatively calm period of trade-related announcements \u2014 a stretch that had helped markets recover to the all-time highs seen in February. Shortly after Trump's post went live, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes briefly turned negative but rallied later in the afternoon to close at all-time highs.",
      "Friday had begun with encouraging comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who indicated the president was open to moving the previously announced deadline for trade deals from July 9 to Labor Day \u2014 and that country-by-country duties themselves were negotiable.",
      "A few hours later, Trump said that initial July 9 deadline was not set in stone, saying the U.S. could either extend or shorten it.",

      "The 25% tariff on non-compliant Canadian goods excludes energy products, which are subject to a 10% rate. Canada is also heavily impacted by Trump's 50% tax on steel and aluminum imports \u2014 the country is the largest foreign supplier of those materials to the U.S. And it has also been impacted by the 25% duties Trump has imposed on foreign-made vehicles and auto parts."

    "summary": "A top Republican senator is proposing a 60% cut in the spy agency led by Tulsi Gabbard as she appears to have fallen out of favor in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A top Republican senator is proposing a sweeping overhaul of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, slashing the workforce of an organization that has expanded since it was created in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.",
      "Under a bill by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, the ODNI\u2019s staff of about 1,600 would be capped at 650, according to a senior Senate aide familiar with the proposed legislation.",
      "ODNI\u2019s workforce was about 2,000 in January, but National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard has already overseen a reduction of about 20% as part of the Trump administration\u2019s drive to shrink the federal workforce. The reduction in the staff Gabbard oversees could weaken her role in the intelligence bureaucracy at a time when she appears to have fallen out of favor with the White House.",
      "The Senate staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Cotton and other Republican senators have been working on the proposed reform for months and that their effort preceded Gabbard\u2019s appointment.",
      "Cotton declined to comment. An ODNI official said Gabbard and her staff have been holding discussions for months with congressional staff members about plans for extensive reforms and cuts at the agency.",
      "\u201cAll parties are interested in advancing reforms that refocus ODNI on its core, national security mission,\u201d the official said.",
      "The official did not comment directly on Cotton\u2019s bill. But the official wrote in a message that Gabbard has detailed plans to make the ODNI more efficient and that \u201cthere will be more announcements to this effect coming soon.\u201d",
      "\u201cFind another agency who has reduced 25% of their workforce in 4 months on the job, saved millions of dollars in taxpayer money, and developed organization wide reform plans that set the example for all IC [intelligence community] elements to emulate,\u201d the official said.",
      "Cotton praised Gabbard in April after she announced a 25% reduction in staffing.",
      "Although lawmakers from both parties have suggested the ODNI should be reformed, it\u2019s not clear whether Cotton\u2019s bill will secure sufficient support to proceed and whether the Trump administration will endorse the proposal.",
      "Senior Trump administration officials held a classified briefing Thursday for senators on the U.S. airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, briefed the lawmakers, but Gabbard did not take part.",
      "A senior administration official said Gabbard was focused on her role as director of national intelligence and played down the fact that she was not part of the group that met with senators.",
      "President Donald Trump appears to have sidelined Gabbard in recent months, NBC News has reported. But allies of Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, say that even though there is some friction with the White House, the tension has been overstated.",
      "Created after 9/11",
      "The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, exposed a failure to share information across spy agencies with catastrophic results. As a result, Congress established the ODNI to oversee all of the country\u2019s 18 intelligence services, including the CIA, and manage bureaucratic turf wars from a complex outside Washington, D.C.",
      "What started as a relatively small office under the national intelligence director in 2005 has expanded over the last 20 years to include in-house analysis teams and centers focused on counterterrorism and counterintelligence. Cotton has described the ODNI as a bloated bureaucracy that should return to its original mission of coordinating the work of other spy agencies instead of producing its own reports and duplicating other agencies\u2019 efforts.",
      "\u201cCongress in no way wanted yet another unruly bureaucracy layered on top of an already bureaucratic intelligence community,\u201d Cotton said at Gabbard\u2019s confirmation hearing in late January. \u201cUnfortunately, 20 years later, that\u2019s exactly what the ODNI has become.\u201d",
      "Gabbard herself expressed support for downsizing the ODNI\u2019s workforce at the hearing, saying she would work with Cotton and other lawmakers to eliminate \"redundancies and bloating.\"",
      "Centers shifted to other agencies",
      "The bill, known as the Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act, would shift a counterterrorism center to the FBI and a center on proliferation and biosecurity to the CIA. The ODNI\u2019s National Intelligence Council, which oversees analyses across U.S. spy agencies, would no longer draft intelligence analyses; instead, it would coordinate the reports created by other elements of the intelligence community.",
      "The ODNI would no longer have \u201ccenters\u201d focused on specific threats or subjects, such as a climate security advisory council. The Foreign Malign Influence Center, which has overseen efforts across the federal government to track efforts by Russia and other adversaries to try to interfere in U.S. elections and decision-making, would also be eliminated.",
      "Many of the ODNI employees who would be cut would return to their home agencies in the intelligence community, the Senate staffer said. The 650 or so who remain there would be considered ODNI\u2019s \u201ctop performers.\u201d"

      "While the Supreme Court on Friday said judges cannot issue sweeping \"universal injunctions\" that can apply nationwide in many cases, it left open the option of plaintiffs seeking broad relief via class action lawsuits.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union filed such a lawsuit in New Hampshire on behalf of immigrants whose children may not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth if Trump's order was to go into effect.",
      "In a separate case in Maryland, in which groups had previously obtained a nationwide injunction, lawyers filed an amended complaint seeking similar class-wide relief for anyone effected by Trump's plan within hours of the ruling authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.",
      "\u201cEvery court to have looked at this cruel order agrees that it is unconstitutional,\u201d said ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision did not remotely suggest otherwise.\"",
      "Under Trump's plan, birthright citizenship would be limited to those who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. That is at odds with the widely accepted understanding of the Constitution's 14th Amendment \u2014 that it grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., with a few minor exceptions.",
      "William Powell, a lawyer involved in the Maryland case, told reporters the amended complaint would seek to \"certify a nationwide class of all people who are affected by the executive order.\"",
      "That would include babies already born and babies to be born in the future, as well as their parents, he said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion on Friday appeared to endorse the idea of class action lawsuits, saying that plaintiffs can \"sometimes seek to proceed by class action ... and ask a court to award preliminary class-wide relief that may, for example, be statewide, region-wide, or even nationwide.\"",
      "The Supreme Court limited the scope of the injunction in the Maryland case, as well as two other nationwide injunctions imposed by judges in Washington state and Massachusetts in cases brought by states.",
      "States cannot bring class action lawsuits, but Barrett wrote in her opinion that they may still be able to seek broad relief in their cases. That leaves open the possibility of injunctions covering anyone who lives within a state and potentially even children who were born elsewhere but move to a covered state.",
      "Samuel Bray, a critic of nationwide injunctions at Notre Dame Law School whose work was cited in the ruling, said both the states and individual plaintiffs can still get broad injunctions against the birthright citizenship executive order, potentially even on a nationwide basis.",
      "\"I don't expect the executive order will ever go into effect,\" he added.",
      "It remains unclear how the Justice Department will respond to new claims.",
      "But at a press conference on Friday, Trump made it clear the administration would proactively use the Supreme Court ruling not just to bolster its birthright citizenship proposal but also to push forward on other policies that have been blocked by judges on a nationwide basis.",
      "\"Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,\" the president said."

But then one day, he received an email with administrative information for musicians, \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, great, I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d",

Once on stage, he asked if there were any veterans in the crowd and put on his tan beret because he said, \u201cit was important that I opened with, \u2018I am a veteran. I fought for this country.\u2019 I believe in the country that America claims to be, even if it isn\u2019t that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Then he removed his button-up shirt to reveal a Canyon County Pride cropped T-shirt. He put on his \u201cbattle jacket\u201d and began to play the song, which is called \u201cBoy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey put him in dresses to keep him in line; they say it\u2019s a phase and it\u2019s all in his mind. They put him in ballet; he wants to play ball. What matters to him doesn\u2019t matter at all. The boy that everyone thought was a girl,\u201d Hamrick sang.",
      "Other lyrics in the song included, \u201cIt\u2019s not just aesthetics; it\u2019s down to his heart. They\u2019re breaking his will, and he\u2019s breaking apart,\u201d and later in the song, \u201cLet teacher take a glance, what\u2019s in your underpants,\u201d a reference to the surge in state laws that regulate which sports teams trans youth can play on at school and which bathrooms they are allowed to use.",
      "Nearly three minutes into the song, one of the festival organizers pulled Hamrick\u2019s mic off the stage, and then security escorted him off as he continued to play his guitar and finished the song without a mic, according to a video posted by the Boise Blackbirds Instagram account, which is run by a local independent journalist and activist.",
      "Hamrick said he wrote the song last year. He is bisexual and not transgender, but he said he has many loved ones who are trans.",
      "\u201cThe song is for everyone who listens to it and feels heard and seen and maybe just a little less alone,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s for people who might be in conservative, religious communities who don\u2019t have a community they can trust.",
      "\u201cKnow that your pastor or your parents or your Boy Scout troop leader isn\u2019t this insurmountable, unquestionable force of nature, but that if you have to hide right now, then that\u2019s what you have to do,\u201d Hamrick said. \u201cYou have to survive. But once you are out of that, there is a community that is ready to take you in and love you and support you.\u201d",
      "Fitzpatrick, the festival\u2019s organizer, described Hamrick\u2019s actions as a \u201cpathetic and evil act\u201d in an email to NBC News.",
      "\u201cOur festival is a fortress for traditional family values: faith, freedom, truth, and the sanctity of what makes us human,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cHe lied to us to get a chance to play on stage in front of our guests, children included, stating his act would honor that. When he got on stage, he threw on part of a military uniform dishonoring the Army, and unleashed a song glorifying transgender ideology. It was a vile anthem pushing the lie that boys can be girls and girls can be boys. So I yanked his mic and told him to leave.\u201d",
      "He said the festival was still a \u201cbigger success than I ever dreamed.\u201d He said he spent about $40,000 personally and is \u201cgetting millions in publicity against the Left wing PRIDE nutjobs.\u201d",
      "As for Hamrick, he said Buzzbomb 7 Eleven is working on recording \u201cBoy\u201d and another song so that they can release it publicly.",
      "Some of his supporters have called him a \u201chero,\u201d but Hamrick said he\u2019s very uncomfortable with that.",
      "\u201cIf it inspired a lot of people to get involved, that\u2019s a wonderful role for me to have,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that I get to play that part, but it is just a small part. If you want to send love, send it to your organizers. Send it to the people who are putting together protests, who are doing food drives for unhoused people. There are people who are on the ground, working every day to try to make life more livable for queer people in this country.\u201d"

      "The Supreme Court on Friday granted the HIV-prevention field a historic win \u2014 yet with a major caveat \u2014 as it upheld a federally appointed health task force\u2019s authority to mandate no-cost insurance coverage of certain preventive interventions, but clarifying that the Health and Human Services secretary holds dominion over the panel.",
      "The 6-3 decision in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc. essentially leaves in place a popular pillar of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that most insurers cover various task force-recommended preventive screenings, therapies and interventions, with no out-of-pocket costs imposed on patients. The case reached the high court after a group of Christian businesses in Texas objected to being compelled to cover a certain drug used for HIV prevention, known as PrEP,  given their claims that it \u201cpromotes homosexuality.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince our efforts to address HIV in the U.S. are under attack on so many levels, preserving insurers\u2019 requirement to cover preventive services, including PrEP, will help ensure access to people who need it,\u201d said Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV + Hepatitis Policy Institute, a patient advocacy group in Washington, D.C.",
      "But the court clarified the scope of the task force\u2019s independence, thus potentially compromising its impact. Addressing concerns that the 16-member volunteer task force\u2019s power over insurers was unconstitutional, the justices asserted that the health secretary holds the authority to appoint and dismiss the panelists and to block their new recommendations from mandating insurance coverage. The secretary could also possibly direct the panel, including one stocked with his or her own hand-picked members, to revisit previous recommendations that have already gone into effect.",
      "Given the unpredictable nature and unconventional approach to health policy of the current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., HIV advocates are concerned that he might undermine the task force\u2019s current or future endorsements of HIV-prevention medications, known as PrEP.",
      "The ruling \u201cis a victory in the sense that it leaves intact the requirement to cover task-force recommendations,\u201d said attorney Richard Hughes, a partner with Epstein Becker Green in Washington, D.C., who represented a group of HIV advocacy organizations in submitting a friend-of-the-court brief in the casel. \u201cIt was always going to be a double-edged sword, as the political accountability that salvaged its authority comes with the ability to alter its recommendations.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has secured only a modest decline recently in HIV cases, and HIV advocates  stand at a crossroads amid the Trump administration\u2019s dramatic withdrawal of support for their cause.",
      "Promisingly, the Food and Drug Administration last week approved a long-acting injectable form of PrEP, Yeztugo, made by Gilead Sciences. Injected every six months, Yeztugo overwhelmingly bested Truvada, a daily-pill form of PrEP also made by Gilead, at lowering HIV transmissions in clinical trials.",
      "But Yeztugo has debuted as the Trump administration is gutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s HIV-prevention division and after it canceled scores of HIV-related research grants.",
      "HIV experts have warned that this upheaval could lead HIV to rise again.",
      "Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc.",
      "The plaintiffs\u2019 initial religious-liberty complaint was ultimately dropped from the case. The court more narrowly considered the constitutionality of an ACA provision that lent effective authority to a longstanding volunteer medical task force to mandate no-cost insurance coverage to preventive interventions that the expert group rated highly, including PrEP.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that because the task force was not appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, granting it such power over insurance markets violated the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause. The justices grappled with the task force\u2019s balance of independence versus accountability. In particular, they sought to determine whether the task force members were appointed by the Senate-confirmed Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In addition to PrEP, the task force has issued high scores, for example, to screening for lung cancer, diabetes, and HIV; treatment to help quit smoking; and behavioral counseling to prevent heart disease.",
      "Had the Supreme Court fully sided with the plaintiffs, insurers would have been free to drop such popular benefits or, at the very least, to impose related co-pays and other cost sharing.",
      "Writing for the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh found that the health secretary has the power \u201cto appoint Task Force members, and no statute restricts their removal.\u201d He was joined by an ideological mix of colleagues, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the right, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson on the left.",
      "Concerns and uncertainty about Kennedy",
      "HIV advocates expressed concern that Kennedy might undo the task force\u2019s recommendation for PrEP, or at the least deprioritize ensuring that Yeztugo receives a clear coverage mandate.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy dismissed the entire CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and replaced them with his own hand-picked selections, including one notable anti-vaccine activist. At the first meeting of the newly formed committee this week, ACIP dropped recommendations for some flu vaccines over claims, widely debunked by researchers, that one ingredient in them is tied to autism.",
      "Mitchell Warren, executive director of the HIV advocacy nonprofit AVAC, expressed concern about \u201cwhat happened with the CDC ACIP this week, as it could be a harbinger of what a secretary of HHS can do to twist committees and task forces that should be composed of experts guided by science to ones that are guided by ideology and politics.\u201d",
      "In an email to NBC News, Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School, characterized Kennedy\u2019s potential approach to overseeing the health task force as unpredictable.",
      "\u201cRFK has been skeptical of the medical approach to HIV/AIDS in the past, and that may color his attitude to revising PrEP guidance,\u201d Shachar said.",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the HIV advocates\u2019 concerns.",
      "In 2019, the health task force granted Truvada as PrEP a top rating. The drug was already widely covered by insurers. But under ACA rules, the task force\u2019s recommendation meant that by January 2021, insurance plans needed to cease imposing cost-sharing for the drug.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, then clarified that insurers were also forbidden to impose cost sharing for the quarterly clinic visits and lab tests required for a PrEP prescription.",
      "A CDC study published in October found that about 200,000 people were using PrEP at any point in 2023.",
      "In 2019, the FDA approved another Gilead daily pill, Descovy, for use as PrEP. In late 2021, ViiV Healthcare\u2019s Apretude \u2014 an injection given every two months \u2014 was also green lit.",
      "The health task force gave top ratings to both of the newer forms of PrEP in 2023, which triggered a mandate for no-cost coverage to begin in January.",
      "A generic version of Truvada emerged in 2020 and now costs as little as $30 per month. The list prices of the three brand-name PrEP drugs range from about $2,200 to $2,350 a month.",
      "How the court\u2019s ruling could play out for HIV prevention",
      "Were Kennedy to appoint task force members who ultimately voided the PrEP coverage mandate, generic Truvada, at the very least, would still likely remain widely covered by insurance. But insurers would be free to demand cost-sharing for all forms of PrEP, including for required clinic visits and lab tests. And they could restrict access to the more expensive versions, including by imposing prior authorization requirements and higher cost sharing.",
      "Research suggests that even a small increase in monthly out-of-pocket costs for PrEP can depress its use and that those who accordingly forgo a prescription are especially likely to contract HIV.",
      "Johanna Mercier, Gilead\u2019s chief commercial officer, said even before the health task force\u2019s 2023 insurance mandate for Descovy went into effect in January, the drug\u2019s coverage was still pretty solid. Private insurers provided unrestricted coverage of Descovy for PrEP to 74% of commercially insured people, and 40% of prescriptions for the drug had no co-pay. After the mandate went into effect \u2014 including after CMS released a clarification on the PrEP-coverage mandate in October \u2014 those rates increased to 93% and 85%, respectively.",
      "This experience, Mercier said, has left the company optimistic that an increasing proportion of health plans will cover Yeztugo during the coming months.",
      "Health-policy experts are not certain whether the existing PrEP rating from the task force automatically applies to Yeztugo, or whether the drug will require its own rating to ensure coverage comes with no cost sharing.",
      "If Apretude\u2019s history is any guide, a requirement for Yeztugo to receive a specific rating could delay a no-cost insurance-coverage mandate for the drug from going into effect until January 2027 or 2028.",
      "It\u2019s also possible that CMS could release guidance clarifying that the existing mandate for PrEP coverage applies to Yeztugo, which would likely have a more immediate impact on coverage.",
      "However, Elizabeth Kaplan, director of health care access at Harvard\u2019s Health Law and Policy Clinic, said in an email that \u201cgiven this administration\u2019s and RFK\u2019s stated priorities,\u201d the publication of a guidance on Yeztugo coverage by an HHS division \u201cappears unlikely.\u201d"

      "A protest led by Native Americans who consider the land sacred is planned near the site on Saturday. There are 15 remaining traditional Miccosukee and Seminole tribal villages in Big Cypress, as well as ceremonial and burial grounds and other gathering sites."

      "A series that wasn\u2019t originally designed for a second season, \u201cSquid Game\u201d became a phenomenon with hundreds of millions of viewers around the world.",

      "Seasons 2 and 3 returned that winner (Lee Jung-jae, who played Seong Gi-hun, aka Player 456) to the arena, but also delved into the lives of the armed, pink-suited guards and a bulldog detective determined to shut the whole system down.",

      "Gi-hun goes through the wringer in Seasons 2 and 3. He bringas himself back into the game in order to subvert it, believing that his experience could foment a rebellion among the players. It turns out that in the game \u2014 as often in real life \u2014 players prefer to vote for their own personal interests rather than what was best for the collective, a brutal metaphor.",

      "In the final round of the game, Gi-hun and the baby make it to the last stage.

But on the final tower, Gi-hun, the baby and Player 333 (Yim Si-wan, playing Lee Myung-gi, the baby\u2019s father) are the only ones left standing. The rules dictated that one person on the tower must die for the game to end, but that person had to die after a button on the tower is pressed. Gi-hun and Myung-gi fight \u2014 and Myung-gi fall from the tower.",
      "Unfortunately, the button wasn\u2019t pushed before he fell, so time had not started and the death didn\u2019t count. A death was still required to end the game. The VIPs in their protected booth expected Gi-hun to sacrifice the baby \u2014 but they clearly didn\u2019t know him well. There\u2019s no real winning at Squid Game, the show seemed to be saying \u2014 all that money didn\u2019t make Gi-hun\u2019s life a whole lot better. So Gi-hun kisses the baby, puts her on the ground and turns to the camera to say, \u201cWe are not horses. We are humans.\u201d Then he falls from the tower and died.",
      "It\u2019s a bittersweet ending, but a profound one \u2014 and answered the question Front Man asked Gi-hun in Season 3: \u201cDo you still have faith in people?\u201d",
      "By not sacrificing an innocent baby, we got Gi-hun\u2019s final answer.",
      "So, who wins \u2018Squid Game\u2019 in Season 3?",
      "Player 222, the infant.",
      "What about the detective, Jun-ho, who\u2019s been investigating the Squid Game?",
      "Hwang Jun-ho (played by Wi Ha-joon) is too late to save Gi-hun, but he is able to send the Korean Coast Guard to the island.",
      "Jun-ho does rescue the escaped Player 246 (Park Gyeong-seok, played by Lee Jin-wook), whose daughter is hospitalized with leukemia.",
      "Jun-ho arrives on the island looking for his brother (In-ho, aka Front Man, played by Lee Byung-hun), making it to the VIP chamber \u2014 just as In-ho retrieved Player 222, the baby, from the top of the final tower.",
      "Jun-ho considers shooting his brother but can\u2019t, because he is afraid of harming the baby. Six months after the game ended, Jun-ho finds the baby and the game\u2019s prize money left for him (probably by In-ho).",
      "Does the pink-suited guard No-eul survive?",
      "Kang No-eul (aka Guard 011, played by Park Gyuyoung) had lost her daughter and bonded with Player 246\u2019s child before coming to the island as a guard.",
      "But when she discovers the organ-harvesting operation going on between the guards and the dead players, she steps up her efforts to help Player 246 escape.",
      "She destroys all evidence he had seen on the island and is prepared to die in the Front Man\u2019s office when she sees Gi-hun\u2019s sacrifice. Hearing the baby, she decides not to kill herself.",
      "Six months later, she shows up visiting Player 246 in the amusement park where he still works and where she used to work in a costume. He remains unaware that she was the one who saved his life, since she had her pink suit and mask on the whole time. She reunites with Player 246\u2019s daughter, now healthy.",
      "But there\u2019s a twist: No-eul, who is a North Korean defector who was separated from her daughter, gets news that the child might be alive in China. We last see No-eul at the airport, ready to get on a plane to possibly visit her daughter.",
      "If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s similar to the way Season 1 ended, with Gi-hun about to go see his own daughter in Los Angeles.",
      "Does Gi-hun live on?",
      "Kind of. When we first meet Gi-hun in Season 1, one reason he gets into the game in the first place is so he could support his daughter. But after he wins, he becomes obsessed with ending the game.",
      "With Gi-hun dead, In-ho (Front Man) makes the trip Gi-hun didn\u2019t: He goes to the U.S. to see the late player\u2019s daughter. He hands over a box of Gi-hun\u2019s belongings to his daughter \u2014 a bloody uniform and a debit card, which probably had the remainder of Gi-hun\u2019s winnings on it. Did In-ho change his own opinion about humanity\u2019s worth? It seems he is preparing to do so.",
      "Will there be more \u2018Squid Game\u2019?",
      "Based on the final scenes, we suspect yes.",
      "In the last scene, after In-ho finishes dropping off the winnings to Gi-hun\u2019s daughter, he spots a woman playing the introductory card-slap game with someone in an alley. And not just anybody \u2014 he sees a Recruiter, played by Cate Blanchett! They don\u2019t speak to each other, though she nods with recognition at him and he moves on.",
      "Season 1 informed us that Squid Games are played around the world, and Deadline reported last year that an English-language version of the series was being developed with director David Fincher at the helm. Maybe we\u2019ve just seen the first scene in \u201cSquid Game: USA\u201d?"

      "The lawsuit, seeking more than $787 million and filed in Delaware Superior Court, claims that Fox \"operates as a propaganda machine for President Trump\u2019s radical right-wing agenda,\" citing the nearly $800-million settlement the network reached with Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 over its coverage of the 2020 election, which Trump lost.",
      "\"By disregarding basic journalistic ethics in favor of malicious propaganda, Fox continues to play a major role in the further erosion of the bedrock principles of informed representative government,\" the lawsuit states. \"Setting the record straight and confronting Fox\u2019s dishonest practices are critical to protecting democracy from being overrun by disinformation and lies.\"",
      "\u201cGov. Newsom\u2019s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him,\" Fox News said in a statement. \"We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed.\"",
      "On June 10, a reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office when he had last spoken with Newsom. Trump replied that it was \"a day ago\" and that he had called the governor \"to tell him, got to do a better job.\"",
      "On X that same day, Newsom responded: \"There was no call. Not even a voicemail.\"",
      "Newsom told MSNBC on June 8 that the two had spoken late on the night of June 6, then accused Trump of being a \u201cstone-cold liar\u201d over the contents of their conversation.",

      "Newsom slammed Trump's move in activating troops as escalatory and, despite some images of violence in the city, said existing law enforcement could have handled any violence or destruction without federal interference.

      "The current court has not yet embraced the nondelegation doctrine, although in different contexts, a majority of justices have indicated support for it. If the court did reinvigorate the idea, agencies would face new limits on their powers to implement existing laws and programs that seek to enforce open-ended laws enacted by Congress.",
      "Although the Trump administration has sought to weaken federal agencies by firing thousands of workers, its lawyers defended the FCC in the case. The administration took over the case from the Biden administration, which had appealed the case to the Supreme Court.",

      "Iranian university students who planned to study in the United States said that their academic careers have been derailed by the Trump administration\u2019s visa ban on people from their country.",
      "Mohamad Enayati, a 28-year-old civil engineering student, said he had spent years attempting to obtain a visa to study in the U.S., stressing out his family with every rejection and losing touch with friends along the way. Navigating an already lengthy visa process for Iranian students had been difficult enough, he said, only for his future to be thrown into limbo by the ban and then the U.S. bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites over the weekend.",
      "\u201cMy parents are really hurt to see me after what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d Enayati said. \u201cMy only plan was to study and get a Ph.D. in the United States. If that doesn\u2019t happen after all I\u2019ve struggled, after all I\u2019ve been through \u2014 I really can\u2019t imagine.\u201d",
      "The students said, however, that by blocking their education in the U.S., the Trump administration unfairly paints Iranians with a broad brush, conflating them with the regime they happen to live under.",
      "\u201cWe cannot be punished because of the place that we came from, the place that we were born,\u201d said Hadis Abbasian, an Iranian cancer researcher who has been waiting for her visa for months. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t our choice.\u201d",
      "The State Department pointed NBC News to a list of limited exceptions to the ban, which include visas for ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran, as well as individuals adopted by American citizens and participants in certain major sporting events.",
      "\u201cThe Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security\u202fand public safety through our visa process,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said.",
      "On Saturday, the U.S. struck Iran\u2019s key nuclear enrichment facilities, escalating a military conflict that began in mid-June when Israel attacked Iran, saying it was trying to halt it from being able to produce nuclear weapons. Most recently, after the U.S. helped negotiate a ceasefire that went into effect Tuesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made a televised speech Thursday, breaking a weeklong silence. In the speech, Khamenei claimed victory over Israel and said that Iran had delivered a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to the U.S.",
      "The U.S. strikes came weeks after Trump announced in a proclamation early this month that Iran would be among 12 countries whose nationals would be fully restricted from entering the U.S. Seven other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "The proclamation said that several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals, while others had high visa overstay rates. In Iran\u2019s case, the administration said that the entry of its nationals had been suspended because it is a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News earlier this month that Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "Enayati said that he was crestfallen by the visa ban \u2014 an emotion that only heightened after the recent U.S. strikes. Enayati, who began the visa process in 2023, had been looking forward to a Ph.D. position at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. He said he\u2019s endured half a dozen visa application rejections. His seventh and final application was placed in administrative processing by the U.S. Embassy where it has remained for more than a year, he said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump travel ban came and it ruined everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI really want to experience the American dream.\u201d",
      "After pouring money and time into the application and visa process, Enayati said it\u2019s difficult to entertain any possible future that doesn\u2019t include an education in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand banning us,\u201d said Enayati, who currently lives in Iran. \u201cWe all have a problem with the Iranian regime, but we are just common people.\u201d",
      "As of the 2023-24 school year, 12,430 Iranian students were enrolled in U.S. universities. The lion\u2019s share of students pursued studies in STEM, particularly in engineering,",
      "Amy Malek, chair of the Iranian and Persian Gulf studies program at Oklahoma State University, said that Iranian students have long been subjected to particularly long processing times and intensive scrutiny when it comes to obtaining visas. She said the demographic was once the largest proportion of international students in the late 1970s, reaching a peak of 51,310 students in the U.S. However, due to geopolitical tensions, those from Iran faced additional screenings and restrictions for decades, she said.",
      "A law under the Obama administration, for example, denied visas to Iranian students whose studies would prepare them for energy or nuclear sectors in their home country. And under the first Trump administration, Iran was among the seven Muslim-majority countries whose nationals were banned from entering the U.S. The ban was lifted under Joe Biden in 2021.",
      "Today, Iranian students often experience significantly longer wait times than those from other countries, with the visa process sometimes taking months to years \u2014 several times longer than the average wait of days to weeks. But, Malek said, many seeking education in the U.S. have historically few ties to political activism or are in opposition to Iran\u2019s ruling theocracy.",
      "\u201cThere is a long-term misunderstanding, or perhaps unwillingness, to see Iranian citizens as separate from their government,\u201d Malek said. \u201cI do think that the U.S. government misses out on opportunities to support the kinds of change that they claim to want for Iran when they undermine the ability for Iranian students to study abroad.\u201d",
      "Abbasian, the cancer researcher, planned to begin her program this year at the University of Missouri. She also said that her studies have always remained strictly academic rather than political. With the ongoing conflict and visa ban threatening students\u2019 future, the restrictions could block opportunities for a generation of scientists, particularly those who may not have the means or time to wait out the indefinite ban, or whose test scores expire while the ban is in effect. Some students will have to resort to continuing their education in other countries or remain in Iran. For Abbasian, she said she\u2019s committed to learning under the University of Missouri\u2019s specific program and is unwilling to give up that goal.",
      "Abbasian, who said she was in shock for days because of the restrictions, said she is determined to find her way to the U.S., speaking out for those in her position and holding out hope for the ban to be lifted at some point.",
      "\u201cNo matter how long this takes, someday I will be in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cI will start my dreams. I believe in my dreams.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for Season 3 of \u201cSquid Game\u201d",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d Season 3 is yet another brutal and devastating season filled with deaths and many surprises.",
      "The third and final season of the hit Korean drama continues to center on Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who is hoping to put an end to the games, while still competing in multiple rounds.",
      "Amid his storyline, there is also another one that centers on Player 246 and Soldier 11. The events from Season 2, specifically the ending, made it seem as though the player had been shot and died after he and others tried to overthrow the game.",
      "However, Season 3 shows otherwise.",
      "Who is Player 246?",
      "Player 246 is Gyeong-seok (Lee Jin-Wook). He entered the games in Season 2 in hopes to get money for his daughter's cancer treatment.",
      "Player 246 was struggling financially and worked at an amusement park with No-eul (Park Gyu-young), who viewers discover is Soldier 11. No-eul is a North Korean defector and former solider who had left her newborn daughter behind.",
      "Viewers saw both of them when Gyeong-seok's daughter was at the amusement park and No-eul, dressed in a Bunny costume, gave her a lollipop. The young child then followed her into the dressing room and saw the rest of the mascots taking off their costumes. Gyeong-seok found her crying and apologized to his colleague.",
      "In another scene, Gyeong-seok's daughter fainted and someone called the ambulance. She was taken to the hospital, where Gyeong-seok was told about how expensive his daughter's treatment will be.",
      "During this time, No-eul checked in on her coworker and his daughter.",
      "What happens to Player 246?",
      "Player 246, also known as Gyung-seok, enters the game and eventually teams up with Gi-hun to begin the rebellion against the game maker. At the end of Season 2, it appears as though he is shot and dies.",
      "However, the third season opens with him begging for his life before he is shot in the abdomen. The guard tells him to close his eyes and do as they say if he wants to live. He is marked as eliminated but in reality, he is not.",
      "He is taken to the guards' organ trafficking ring but Soldier 11 infiltrates the team and saves him. She disguises him in a soldier outfit and they break out of the building with the help of others.",
      "As they're leaving on a boat, Soldier 11 gets a message to turn around with Player 246. In return, she will be able to live. The officer tells her that he has all of Gyung-seok's information, including where his daughter is being treated.",
      "No-eul returns to the island but tells Gyung-seok to leave and when he gets to land call the police because his daughter is in danger. She doesn't reveal who she is.",
      "Instead, she goes back into the building and makes the Masked officer delete all the records about Player 246. While the online information is deleted, there is still a hard copy in the captain's archive.",
      "They go to the restricted office and fight to the death. No-eul ends up killing him and goes in search of the book with all the players' information.",

      "Gyung-seok tells Hwang Jun-ho and his crew where the island is.",
      "Six months later, he is seen back at his amusement park job, drawing No-eul's portrait \u2014 though, he doesn't initially remember who she is.",
      "His daughter runs up to him. She has recovered and is doing well. No-eul greats her and gives her a lollipop, before leaving the park."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:02:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Canadian radio show host and poet Josie Balka talks to TODAY.com about her first book, \"I Hope You Remember,\" and what her rise on social media has been like.",
    "story": [
      "In a world where highly produced social media videos tend to be king, Josie Balka's could be described as visually straightforward by comparison.",
      "Typically wearing leisurewear, the Canadian radio show host looks into a camera in the soundproof studio she created in her basement. With a microphone propped in front of her, she records poems \u2014 ones she's written that cover complicated topics like friendships, broken hearts, body insecurities, aging and grief.",
      "And these poems have now been watched over 100 million times on TikTok alone (yes, we counted).",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t remember anyone I\u2019ve ever seen at a public pool with such a memorable body, good or bad, that I think about it ever again,\u201d begins what is her most popular poem thus far.",
      "In it, she reflects on all the aspects of a person that only briefly grab her attention \u2014 their body, their looks \u2014 before pivoting to what she does remember.",
      "\u201cWhen I talk about my friends, sometimes I will bother to note that they are beautiful, yes. But I will list the things that make them that way,\u201d she says.",
      "What began as a regulation exercise from her therapist has turned Balka into a viral sensation in late 20223, with the likes of John Mayer, Jennifer Aniston and Mel Robbins sharing her work. And now, with the release of her first book, \"I Hope You Remember,\" Balka can add New York Times bestselling author to her list of accolades. (Her second book, \"Loves of Our Lives,\" will be out January 2026.)",
      "\"It's hard to wrap my head around,\" she tells TODAY.com on the phone as she sat on her porch earlier this month. \"It just doesn't feel real.\"",
      "Balka spoke with TODAY.com about her sudden viral rise, how quickly she can whip up a poem, the themes to which she keeps returning and whether her fianc\u00e9 is terrified about writing his own wedding vows (spoiler alert: he is).",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "The one thing that I worry about the most is the people that I know thinking that it\u2019s not cool. I love that quote that\u2019s like, \"It\u2019s only cringy until it works.\" I feel like at first, I was a little bit more sensitive to any negativity, which there honestly hasn\u2019t been a ton of, which is really nice because I know on the internet when I post other kinds of content, there can be. But usually with poems, it\u2019s pretty positive. Anybody who\u2019s being mean on the internet, I would never admire those people, so I find that I can\u2019t be scared of them either.",
      "I had one go super viral at the end of 2023, the public pool one. And that was kind of the first one that I was like, \u201cWoah, what just happened?\u201d I think as kind of unfortunate as it is, one of the main ways that I want to push forward is when people are encouraging me to do so, and sometimes it does take a little bit of enforcement. And being encouraged by celebrities that I\u2019ve looked up to for a long time, I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This could be something.\u201d",
      "I believe that I had just gone shopping or was looking at bathing",
      "Some of the most resonating things are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way.",
      "Josie balka",
      "suits online and I was just thinking about how crappy of an experience that always is for me. And I just have never, ever put any significance into why I love somebody based on their body. I kind of was like, \u201cWhy are you so worried that everyone's looking at you when you\u2019ve never looked at anybody else and remembered them?\u201d",
      "It kind of spiraled into all these other reasons that describe why people care about who you are and not how you look, and different scenarios in your life. I feel like it\u2019s a really important thing to remember.",
      "I lost over 100 pounds, and I have lots of trauma from it. I\u2019ve had a few surgeries for loose skin and that kind of stuff. After my first plastic surgery for my lower body, I got sepsis and almost died. It's crazy that I did this for how I looked, and then I almost died. And it didn\u2019t make me any happier. It just made me feel smaller, and I kind of thought that was the only thing I needed or wanted.",
      "And then there was kind of a big realization when I got to my goal. I still had all these things to work through and my happiness was never really dependent on the way that I looked in the way that I thought. I think there\u2019s a lot of people who sit around saying, \u201cWell, if I just lost 10 pounds \u2026 if I didn\u2019t have this loose skin, my life would be so much better.\u201d But there\u2019s no end goal, you just find something else. The way you look will never be the only thing. And I feel like I\u2019ve learned that firsthand a lot over the last few years.",
      "Some of the most resonating things I find are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way, because I truly don\u2019t think there are many unique experiences. Often if you just say the one thing that you carry the most shame over out loud, you\u2019ll find 100 other people that feel that way too. That\u2019s kind of why I leaned into it.",
      "It goes both ways.  Every time somebody goes, \"Oh, I really related to this thing, it made me feel less alone,\" I get to be like, \"Oh, because you related to this, now I know that I\u2019m not alone in that thought.\" I hope that other people scrolling through the comment section of a video they resonate with are seeing 100 other people that are like, \"Me too, me too, me too.\" And we can make everyone feel less alone together.",
      "I would have to have more of a routine with it. I usually just write down ideas as they come to me. I'll think of a line while I\u2019m driving or at work and I\u2019ll just type it into my phone. Eventually I\u2019ll scroll through all the one-liners on my notes app and expand on one of them. And if I feel like it\u2019s good enough, I\u2019ll go downstairs in my studio and record and post it. I\u2019d say 99% of the time, I write, record and post all in the same night.",
      "He was not wanting to do vows in front of people. He is very loving and very sweet and he\u2019s not shy to tell me how he feels but he is definitely shy to speak in front of a crowd. Originally he was like, \u201cCan we please just do private vows?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNope, I want to do them in front of everybody.\u201d So we are going to do them.",
      "I honestly don\u2019t think they will be that crazy or that amazing. They\u2019ll be pretty personalized, it\u2019ll probably be the way I would talk to him on a normal day.",
      "I think that\u2019s kind of the scary thing about success: It never feels like enough. Like everything after, if it\u2019s not quite up to par, you always feel like you didn\u2019t do as good a job, you know? Obviously in my head, I hope for success moving forward. But I also just hope to keep enjoying it. I love doing it, it\u2019s my total passion. It\u2019s my journal entries come to life. It\u2019s what my therapist told me to do to get regulated. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that it\u2019s turned into something like this, and I just hope that I continue to love that and I continue to be able to connect with people.",
      "I remember saying to my therapist once at the beginning, \"What if I can\u2019t continue it? What if I can\u2019t maintain it?\" And she was like, \"Nobody can ever take away what\u2019s already happened.\" So I think that I get to move forward knowing that what\u2019s already happened is mine. Obviously I hope for more of it, but even if all I got was what I have, I would be so happy to have it."

      "Charlie or Pepe? Where Hannah\u2019s Heart Lies",
      "The end of Hannah\u2019s journey on \u201cLove Island USA\u201d was a choice made by her fellow islanders. During Sunday\u2019s episode, the islanders were informed that America had been voting on their favorite guys and girls, as individuals. When the bottom three guys and bottom the girls were revealed, the rest of the villa had to choose two people \u2014 a guy and a girl \u2014 to dump. The girls eliminated Hannah, and the guys nixed Jeremiah.",
      "To many viewers, the islanders\u2019 selections were shocking moves. Jeremiah had been coming out of his shell after finding resolution in his hectic breakup with Huda. As for Hannah, she had just witnessed her first connection, Charlie, exit the villa in the same way and was finding a bit of happiness with a new guy, Pepe.",
      "Following her elimination, a pressing question remained: Does Hannah\u2019s heart lie with Pepe ... or with Charlie?",
      "\u201cMy heart is waiting for Pepe to get out of that villa,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve just been waiting and waiting to see if that\u2019s going to go anywhere. We had a really good talk before I left, and I\u2019ve just really been missing him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come from this, and I don\u2019t know where his heart lies. I just know how I feel.\u201d",
      "Hannah also acknowledges her complicated feelings about Charlie, too: \u201cI think with Charlie as well, I don\u2019t know where his heart lies now. Obviously a lot has happened since he\u2019s left, and that can\u2019t be easy to witness.\u201d",
      "For now, she\u2019s acknowledges that the \u201creal world\u201d is much different than the villa, where around-the-clock proximity plays a big role.",
      "She adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s a waiting game to see where everything lies out and what really aligns for us, and see if we really work outside of the villa.\u201d",
      "Did Hannah Hope Pepe Would Leave With Her?",
      "Feelings are always heightened immediately following dumpings, and Hannah\u2019s was no exception. Was there any part of Hannah that thought Pepe might feel strongly enough to leave with her?",
      "\u201cHe had kind of mentioned it, but I just don\u2019t really think that it was an option,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cEven when Charlie left, I had thought about leaving. I think I had told Iris, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to go,\u2019 but I just don\u2019t think it was an actual option to leave. I don\u2019t really know exactly. Maybe it is.\u201d",

      "\u201cI kind of had told him, \u2018Don\u2019t ruin your experience.\u2019 I wanted him to have the best experience, and I don\u2019t hold it against him for not leaving at all, definitely. But you know I wish that he could have.\u201d",

      "Despite the girls choosing to send her home, Hannah maintains that they will remain close.",
      "\u201cI think our sisterhood is really, really strong,\u201d Hanna tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think obviously there were moments where we\u2019d have little, you know, back-and-forth arguments \u2014 but honestly not really. There were only a couple notable ones and we really bounced back super fast from that.\u201d",
      "She mentions Huda, who had pursued Pepe briefly without being upfront with Hannah about it.",
      "\u201cI did have that falling out with Huda and we never really resolved that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that would need to be resolved post-villa, but I\u2019m not closing myself off to any of them.\u201d",
      "Drama aside, Hannah maintains hope for her villa friendships and even has someone she\u2019s rooting to win.",

      "As for watching the rest of the season? \u201cOh, yes I will, absolutely. Even if I wasn\u2019t on the show, I would\u2019ve watched the show the whole time.\u201d"

      "Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, died at age 86 in May 2024, leaving the family without a woman Obama called her \"rock.\"",
      "The former first lady spoke with NPR's Rachel Martin on her \"Wild Card\" podcast about how a declaration by Robinson toward the end of her life had a profound impact on Obama.",
      "Obama said she was taking care of an ailing Robinson at the Obamas' home in Hawaii in the last year of Robinson's life when her mother's short reflection caused her to pause.",
      "\"She was realizing that she will not ever be the same old self that she was. She was starting to realize she's coming to the end,\" Obama said. \"And this woman that prepared me for death and talked to me about all this stuff and was like, 'I'm ready to die, who needs old people around too long,' and blah, blah, blah. She leaned over to me and said, 'Wow, this went fast.'\"",

    "story": [
      "The latest season of \"The Bear\" has dropped, and like its predecessors, it's riddled with highs, lows and plenty of heartbreak.",
      "\"The clock is ticking. Every second counts,\" Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas tells TODAY.com of Season 4, quoting the show's often-repeated mantra.",
      "Col\u00f3n-Zayas plays Tina Marrero on the hit Hulu series, who takes a line cook job at Chicago's Original Beef after being laid off from her longtime office job. When Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) takes over the restaurant, Tina is forced to either evolve or leave. She chooses the former, eventually becoming a sous chef at The Bear, finding a home in the found family that includes Carmy, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and Natalie (Abby Elliott).",
      "Much like her character, Col\u00f3n-Zayas, too, has undergone her own transformation.",
      "\u201cThe struggles to get through the day has been really profoundly anxiety-producing for me as an actor,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I look at Tina\u2019s journey and I just get it.\u201d",
      "Born and raised in New York City, Col\u00f3n-Zayas pursued a stage career and found modest success in theater before transitioning to television, where she's played a variety of parts over a span of three decades, doggedly pursuing the break \"The Bear\" eventually delivered.",
      "The struggles to get through the day has been really profoundly anxiety-producing for me as an actor. And I look at Tina\u2019s journey and I just get it.\u201d",
      "Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas",
      "\"It's been a long struggle. It's been a lot of rejection. Hundreds of rejections. So, I understand Tina's resentment for these millennials that she feels are pushing her out. And she has very little to begin with and she's just trying to take care of her family,\" she says. \"I get it.\"",
      "Tina's combination of grit, independence and raw vulnerability has made her a fan-favorite character on the show. In 2024, Col\u00f3n-Zayas' performance won her an Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy, adding to the impressive collection of awards the show has picked up since premiering in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the writing, but it\u2019s also that vulnerability of opening up and saying, \u2018Here\u2019s all of this mess, all of this stuff that we have been programmed to hide and not express. Yet, we all work walking around with this stuff,\u2019\u201d Col\u00f3n-Zayas says.",
      "While the show has historically competed in the comedy category, \"The Bear\" is known for its emotional resonance with audiences, which Col\u00f3n-Zayas credits to the show's exploration of family.",
      "\"That is such a huge part of why The Bear family is together and is protecting each other. We all have these demons. I think this show resonates with so many people because they're like, 'Yeah, that was my family on Christmas. Yeah, that's me trying to find a job,'\" says Col\u00f3n-Zayas. \"So I'm grateful that these stories have been told because I think, I'm not the only one.\"",
      "Unpacking That 'Terrifying' Scene from Season 2",
      "Fans of \"The Bear\" will likely remember Col\u00f3n-Zayas singing karaoke in a bar full of people, most of them half her age, in Episode 5 of Season 2. Her emotional rendition of \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\" was one of Tina's turning points in the series and something Col\u00f3n-Zayas says was completely \"terrifying.\"",
      "\"I'm from theater. I'm not from musical theater, so I don't sing,\" she explains, adding that the daunting scene was also filmed live.",
      "\"There's no auto-tuning going on. This sound is coming through these bar speakers. Like, it wasn't a pretty sound. There was no going back and redoing those scenes, singing in a smoother, prettier way,\" she says.",
      "The performance was not only a win for Col\u00f3n-Zayas, but also for her character, who, despite insecurity, stands up and allows herself to truly be seen. Col\u00f3n-Zayas says it represented her character \u201cpushing through that fear ... rather than just assuming that these people are going to shut me out.\"",
      "It's also a moment that marks Tina's willingness to be vulnerable, take risks and accept her place in The Bear's family.",
      "\"Those are the very same people who are embracing me and giving me a second chance,\" she says of her character's coworkers.",
      "It's not much different off screen, with Col\u00f3n-Zayas calling \"The Bear\" cast her \"kids,\" adding, \"They're so talented and fun.\"",
      "Paralleling Tina\u2019s journey, Col\u00f3n-Zayas says she's found her own second chance through the success of \u201cThe Bear.\u201d",
      "\u201cComing out on this side, I\u2019m a work in progress, but I am accepting that as long as I am proud of the work and doing the best I can, and protect my integrity, there are others around me that are noticing, who are respecting that, and who want that in the world,\" she says. \"And so I\u2019m just learning to rewire my brain.\u201d",
      "\u2018Doomsday Could be Coming\u2019 in Season 4",
      "Col\u00f3n-Zayas previewed Season 4, which dropped in full June 25, on TODAY with Jenna and Friends, saying, \u201cWe go much deeper in our own personal responsibility and reckoning.\u201d",
      "She also promised that \u201cof course,\u201d the season features the show\u2019s signature sense of heightened anxiety that comes from the fast-paced restaurant setting.",

      "\u201cBut it is nerve-wracking at this point,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe all are just looking at what we\u2019re bringing.\u201d",
      "She says the season will force each character to examine what they bring to their found family.",
      "\u201cLike, what are each of us doing, individually and collectively, to this family that we\u2019ve made with the time that we have?\u201d she says.",

      "Fans have watched Joe carry a torch for Georgia since Season 1. And while Georgia has been in and out of relationships, Ablack believes their timing might be right. The two finally get together in Season 3.",
      "\u201cHe confesses his feelings for her (again) because they haven\u2019t changed,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cThe timing is starting to become right for her.\u201d",
      "But, Ablack says, Georgia and Joe are not quite ready to get together. For one, Georgia is newly divorced from Paul (Scott Porter), the mayor. Then there are the legal troubles. She\u2019s currently on trial for the murder of Cynthia\u2019s (Sabrina Grdevich) husband and the Department of Child Services has temporarily removed her children, Ginny and Austin, from her custody. With so much unresolved, Joe and Georgia\u2019s future remains uncertain.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019re together in perfect harmony just yet,\u201d Ablack says of the pair. \u201cGeorgia needs to take some time and give some attention to her kids who need her right now \u2026 so they understand each other, but they\u2019re not getting involved yet.\u201d",
      "Ablack thinks Joe is waiting for Georgia to be ready.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that Joe has any judgment for Georgia,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants her to feel any kind of shame \u2026 if she were ready today to be together romantically, I think he would be very open to it.\u201d",
      "The topic of timing comes up between Joe and Georgia this season. In one episode, Joe pointedly questions the timeline of Georgia\u2019s relationship with her ex, Paul. For example, in a tense scene, a drunk Paul reveals to Joe that he had been intimate with Georgia. Joe, clearly unsettled, repeatedly asks Paul when it happened, pressing for specifics.",
      "Ablack says Joe\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t about jealousy, but about seeking clarity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to understand when and how real their relationship could be,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cIf they had sex after Joe and Georgia had that conversation, it would hurt Joe\u2019s feelings a little bit.\u201d",
      "The season ends with a cliffhanger: Georgia is pregnant. With unresolved feelings for Joe and a recent relationship with Paul, it\u2019s unclear who the father is.",
      "When asked how Joe would feel if he were the father, Ablack says, \u201cI think he would love to be the father of Georgia\u2019s child. Joe is great with kids \u2026 he\u2019s a pushover and a teddy bear.\u201d",
      "Even if he\u2019s not the biological father, Ablack believes Joe would fully embrace a parental role.",
      "\u201cI think Ginny and Austin could bully him into getting whatever they want,\u201d Ablack says with a laugh. \u201cHe would enjoy being manipulated.\u201d",
      "The actor also predicts how Joe\u2019s growing relationship with Georgia might affect her kids.",
      "\u201cI think (Ginny) would be a cheerleader for the relationship,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cBut I have no idea how Austin will respond to a new relationship. I hope that Joe will still approach everyone with love and compassion.\u201d",
      "This season, Joe remained loyal to Georgia through her legal troubles, something Ablack appreciated about his character.",
      "\u201cWhen push comes to shove and she\u2019s on trial for murder, I always felt that Joe was steadfast and noble,\u201d he says. \u201cHe showed up for her at all times.\u201d",
      "Despite the potential drama \u2014 and a possible baby daddy bombshell \u2014 Ablack said Joe\u2019s devotion to Georgia is unwavering.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that could happen\u2026 that would impede his love for her,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019ll always love her no matter what.\u201d"

    "summary": "Who wins Squid Game? Who survives Squid Game? Does Player 456 and Player 222 survive? here's what happens in the Season 3 finale.",
    "story": [
      "After three seasons, hundreds of deaths, billions of Korean won handed out, and a seemingly infinite rollercoaster of twists and turns, \u201cSquid Game\u201d has now dropped its final episodes on Netflix.",
      "A series that wasn\u2019t originally designed for a second season, \u201cSquid Game\u201d became a phenomenon with hundreds of millions of views around the world.",
      "Season 1 introduced audiences to the Korean series in which a secret game show was played on a remote island for the benefit of a few, wealthy, masked, VIPs, with only one winner allowed to take home the prize.",
      "Seasons 2 and 3 returned that winner (Lee Jung-jae, who played Seong Gi-hun, aka Player 456) to the arena, but also delved into the lives of the armed, pink-suited guards and a bulldog detective determined to shut the whole system down.",
      "Now that the final game (or so we think) has been played, who were the winners? Who were the losers? Let\u2019s dig into what we know. But beware \u2014 things get dark in this \u201cGame.\u201d",
      "Warning: Spoilers for all of \"Squid Game\" ahead.",
      "Does Player 456 die in 'Squid Game'? Seong Gi-hun's fate, explained",
      "Gi-hun went through the wringer in Seasons 2 and 3. He brought himself back into the game in order to subvert it, believing that his experience could foment a rebellion among the players. It turned out in the game \u2014 as often in real life \u2014 players preferred to vote for their own personal interests, rather than what was best for the collective, a brutal metaphor.",
      "Disillusioned by humanity after several of the games, Gi-hun checked out of active participation as much as he could \u2014 until circumstances brought him a baby to protect during the game. The baby was given its late mother\u2019s (Jo Yuri, playing Kim Jun-hee, aka Player 222) number, and permitted to \u201cparticipate\u201d in her stead.",
      "In the final round of the Game, Gi-hun and the baby made it to the last stage. They\u2019d had to face off numerous final players in the last test, which involved pushing players from the top of several tall towers. But on the final tower, Gi-hun, the baby, and Player 333 (Yim Si-wan, playing Lee Myung-gi, the baby\u2019s father) were the only ones left standing. The rules dictated that one person on the tower must die for the game to end, but that person had to die after a button on the tower is pressed. Gi-hun and Myung-gi fight \u2014 and Myung-gi fell from the tower.",
      "Unfortunately, the button wasn't pushed before he fell, so time had not started and the death didn't count. A death was still required to end the game. The VIPs in their protected booth expected Gi-hun to sacrifice the baby \u2014 but they clearly didn't know him well. There's no real winning at Squid Game, the show seemed to be saying \u2014 all that money didn\u2019t make Gi-hun\u2019s life a whole lot better. So Gi-hun kissed the baby, put her on the ground and turn to the camera to say, \u201cWe are not horses. We are humans.\u201d Then he fell from the tower and died.",
      "It\u2019s a bittersweet ending, but a profound one \u2014 and answered the question Front Man asked Gi-hun in Season 3: \u201cDo you still have faith in people?\u201d",
      "By not sacrificing an innocent baby, we got Gi-hun\u2019s final answer.",
      "So, who wins \u2018Squid Game\u2019 in Season 3?",
      "Player 222, the infant.",
      "What about the detective, Jun-ho, who\u2019s been investigating the Squid Game?",
      "Hwang Jun-ho (played by Wi Ha-joon) was too late to save Gi-hun, but he was able to send the Korean Coast Guard to the island.",
      "Jun-ho did rescue the escaped Player 246 (Park Gyeong-seok, played by Lee Jin-wook), whose daughter was hospitalized with leukemia.",
      "Jun-ho arrived on the island, looking for his brother (In-ho, aka Front Man, played by Lee Byung-hun), making it to the VIP chamber \u2014 just as In-ho retrieved Player 222/the baby from the top of the final tower.",
      "Jun-ho considered shooting his brother, but couldn't, afraid of harming the baby. Six months after the game ended, Jun-ho found the baby and the game\u2019s prize money left for him (probably by In-ho).",
      "Does the pink-suited guard No-eul survive?",
      "Kang No-eul (aka Guard 011, played by Park Gyuyoung), had lost her daughter and bonded with Player 246\u2019s child before coming to the island as a guard.",
      "But when she discovered the organ harvesting operation going on between the guards and the dead players, she stepped up her efforts to help Player 246 escape.",
      "She destroyed all evidence he had been on the island, and was prepared to die in the Front Man\u2019s office when she saw Gi-hun\u2019s sacrifice. Hearing the baby, she decided not to kill herself.",
      "Six months later, she showed up visiting Player 246 in the amusement park where he still works, and where she used to work in a costume. He remained unaware that she was the one who saved his life, since she had her pink suit and mask on the whole time. She reunited with Player 246\u2019s daughter, now healthy.",
      "But there\u2019s a twist: No-eul is a North Korean defector who was separated from her daughter. She gets news the child might be alive in China. We last see No-eul at the airport, ready to get on a plane to possibly visit her daughter.",
      "If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s similar to the way Season 1 ended, with Gi-hun about to go see his own daughter in Los Angeles.",
      "Does Gi-hun live on?",
      "Kind of. When we first met Gi-hun in Season 1, one reason he got into the Game in the first place was so he could support his daughter. But after he won, he became obsessed with ending the game.",
      "With Gi-hun dead, In-ho (Front Man) made the trip Gi-hun didn\u2019t: He went to the U.S. to see the late player\u2019s daughter. He handed over a box of Gi-hun\u2019s belongings to his daughter \u2014 a bloody uniform and a debit card, which probably had the remainder of Gi-hun\u2019s winnings on it. Did In-ho change his own opinion about humanity\u2019s worth? It seemed he was preparing to do so.",
      "Will there be more \u2018Squid Game\u2019?",
      "Based on the final scenes, we suspect yes.",
      "In the last scene, after In-ho finished dropping off the winnings to Gi-hun\u2019s daughter, he spotted a woman playing the introductory card-slap game with someone in an alley. And not just anybody \u2014 he saw a Recruiter, played by Cate Blanchett! They didn't speak to each other, though she nodded with recognition at him and he moved on.",
      "Season 1 informed us that Squid Games are played around the world, and last October Deadline reported that an English-language version of the series was being developed with director David Fincher. Maybe we\u2019ve just seen the first scene in \u201cSquid Game: USA\u201d?"

      "The term \u201cfridge cigarette\u201d \u2014 also known as a Diet Coke \u2014 has recently taken off online, thanks to a video posted on June 8 by TikToker Rachel Reno.",
      "\u201coverheard someone call Diet Coke a \u2018fridge cigarette\u2019 and nothing\u2019s been more true to me since,\u201d her caption reads.",

      "\u201cThe best insights are ones that we don\u2019t have to explain to each other, we just \u2018get it\u2019 \u2014 and people just get the analogy,\u201d Reno tells TODAY.com. \u201cEven though Diet Coke might not want to be associated with cigarettes, it\u2019s a truth about the brand that resonates with millions of people.\u201d",
      "While the term \u201cfridge cigarette\u201d is new to the internet\u2019s lexicon, the idea of treating oneself to a Diet Coke break is not.",
      "In spring 2023, the hashtag #dietcokebreak racked up millions of views on TikTok, which led some publications to deem the practice \u201cGen Z\u2019s version of the smoke break.\u201d",

      "And a June 2023 post on X described Diet Coke as having \u201ccigarette aesthetic.\u201d",
      "The comparison may persist because of the idea that sodas \u2014 even diet ones \u2014 are not good for you. A 2020 study found that those who drank many beverages with artificial sweeteners had a higher risk of heart disease than those who didn\u2019t consume them.",
      "On June 9, Reno posted a follow-up video expanding on the orginal idea, categorizing regular Coke, Coke Zero and other diet sodas into types of cigarettes.",
      "\u201cPeople mentioning La Croix or sparkling water, respect to you, for me, that is a juice treat,\u201d she says, adding that they are tantamount to prop cigarettes in plays. \u201cA few people have asked about full-fat Coke in the glass bottle, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s a cigar.\u2019\u201d"

      "Where in the world have Nic and Olandria gone on \u201cLove Island USA\u201d? That was the big question left heading into Season 7, Episode 21.",
      "In the episode prior, original islanders Olandria and Nic had been eliminated from the show in two dramatic re-couplings. Six of the guy bombshells in Casa Amor were tasked with choosing among the seven girl islanders to couple with, and Olandria was left as the single one out. Nic, who had been among the six guy islanders left back at the villa, exited in the same situation.",
      "The girls in Casa had tearfully bid adieu to Olandria \u2014 and just after the guys said farewell to Nic, a twist threw things for a loop. A black car pulled up to the villa to greet Nic \u2014 and there was Olandria, ready to take him \u2026 well, where?",
      "So that\u2019s where Episode 21 picks up. Here\u2019s what happened next.",
      "What Happens With Nic and Olandria?",
      "The end of the last episode left viewers eager to know what happens with Nic and Olandria. Were they leaving the island or not?",
      "Episode 21 answers those questions: The black car takes Nic and Olandria to \u2026 a date. They sit at a table for two beneath twinkle lights, sipping Champagne as they debrief the last few days.",
      "\u201cI have so much to tell you,\u201d Nic says. \u201cI want to hear everything.\u201d",
      "Olandria tells Nic about Cierra, who had spent her few days at Casa Amor getting to know a bombshell named Elan. Cierra had been conflicted about this, however, because she already had strong feelings for Nic back at the villa. Nic, meanwhile, had told Cierra before Casa Amor that he wanted to keep seeking other connections.",
      "\u201cThat worries me,\u201d Nic tells Olandria. \u201cI told her I wanted to be open because I want to test this connection, but I felt like she wanted to be closed off. But then now I\u2019m sitting here, like, I didn\u2019t find anybody. And she found somebody in Casa. It\u2019s going to be a test, for sure.\u201d",
      "Now Nic tells Olandria about Taylor. He had been vibing in the villa with a bombshell named Clarke, though he and Olandria had a maintained a connection before Casa.",
      "\u201cTaylor\u2019s my good friend, but I\u2019m putting that off to the side right now,\u201d Nic says. \u201cThe girl I was coupled up with, Clarke, chose him at the re-coupling. He feels this emotional connection with her. And he also feels this physical connection with her.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to take my man from me, Taylor was never mine to begin with,\u201d Olandria says to Nic.",
      "Then Nic gets a text: He and Olandria both now have a choice. They can each remain single but they must leave the island tonight \u2014 or they can couple up and return to the villa together.",
      "Olandria\u2019s in favor of coupling to return to the villa. Then Nic adds, \u201cI just want to say, I\u2019ve been wanting to get to know you. I feel like we haven\u2019t had the opportunity to get these conversations.\u201d",
      "Olandria agrees \u2014 she felt Nic had a lot going on with Cierra and Belle-A and didn\u2019t want to insert herself.",
      "So that\u2019s when Nic and Olandria execute a plan to get back to the villa. After the guy islanders and girl bombshells head to bed, Nic and Olandria sneak back in. They get into their PJs, creep into the bedroom and crawl into the same bed as a new couple.",
      "As the sun rises, the viewers see what happens. They\u2019re all shocked \u2014 sort of? \u2014 to see Olandria and Nic back at the villa. Nic tells the rest of he guy islanders about what he learned about Casa from Olandria. Taylor seems like he\u2019s in the biggest pickle: He\u2019s vibing with Clarke, but that could get weird now that Olandria\u2019s back.",
      "Later, Nic and Olandria chat a bit about their own situation in Soul Ties. Nic says he felt a connection with Olandria from the beginning of the show. Olandria is smitten but admits in a confessional that this is complicated; Taylor is one of Nic\u2019s closest friends, while she and Cierra are also tight.",
      "After a challenge between Casa and the villa, Nic and Olandria wrap the night with a chat in Soul Ties.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a strong physical connection between Olandria and me,\u201d Nic says in a confessional. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most attractive people I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Just after cutting to Cierra \u2014 who\u2019s says in a confessional that she\u2019d be upset if Nic had found a connection back at the villa \u2014 the episode wraps as Olandria and Nic share a steamy kiss."

    "summary": "\u201cF1 The Movie,\" starring Brad Pitt, opens June 27. Here's what to know about the Formula 1 racing movie, including whether it's based on a true story.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cF1 The Movie\u201d promises to be an action-packed film, showcasing the fast-paced and entertaining world of Formula 1.",
      "Brad Pitt stars as Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver from the '90s who had a promising career until an accident on the track nearly ended his life. Thirty years later, his friend and owner of a struggling Formula 1 team, Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), convinces him to return to the sport. This time, he's driving alongside the team's hotshot rookie, Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), attempting to work together and nab some wins.",
      "\u201cIt was a thrill to do,\u201d producer Jerry Bruckheimer tells TODAY.com, describing the film as an \u201cemotional journey we take you on.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what we love about this movie. It\u2019s a redemption story.\u201d",
      "F1 has become more popular in the U.S. following the release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d now in its seventh season. U.S. viewership of the motorsport is also growing. ESPN recently said that F1 telecasts across ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 are averaging 1.3 million viewers, up over the 2023 season and 2024 season average of 1.1 million per race.",
      "With more people getting into Formula 1, many are curious about the events in the film and if they are inspired by real-life people. Bruckheimer, director Joseph Kosinski and the cast break it down.",
      "Is 'F1 The Movie' Based on a True Story?",
      "No, \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d is not based on a true story.",
      "However, Bruckheimer and Kosinski enlisted seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton as a producer and adviser to make the film as authentic as possible.",
      "Did 'F1 The Movie' Film at Real Races?",
      "Yes, \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d was filmed during real Grand Prix weekends during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.",
      "Real F1 drivers from the 10 teams were also included in the film, as well as team principals like Ferrari's Fred Vasseur and Mercedes' Toto Wolff, among other notable figures.",
      "According to Bruckheimer, the film crew built their own garage and six modified Formula 2 cars designed by Mercedes. Kosinski also noted that the team developed a camera system from scratch that was small enough to mount on the car to show the experience of what it feels like to drive one of the vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe had track time at every race,\u201d Bruckheimer says, explaining that they would get a couple of minutes in between qualifying or practice to film the fictional APXGP team with the other teams.",
      "\u201cWhat was exciting for our actors is, first of all, they\u2019re driving these cars at high speeds in front of 140,000 people and ... 100 million people on television, nobody knew that Brad and Damson were driving these cars,\u201d he adds. \u201cThen we had the track when the teams weren\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Pitt also told TODAY during a surprise appearance at a New York screening about his experience driving the car.",
      "\u201cOur first scene was on the grid during race weekend at Silverstone (home of British Grand Prix events), where F1 started, and we were on the grid with the drivers,\u201d he told Savannah Guthrie. \u201cWe got one take, and we\u2019re moving on. And it just led to this great kind of energy you\u2019ll see that I think shows on the screen.\u201d",
      "Calling the action \u201csuch a thrill,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to explain what these cars can do. We would be barreling down the straight at 180, and you think that\u2019s something. But the fact that these cars can brake, can stop and make a complete right turn, it feels like the car is going to flip, and it sticks. It is unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable what these drivers can do.\u201d",
      "Were Any Characters Inspired by Real F1 Figures?",
      "No, most characters were created for the film. However, some actors drew inspiration from a number of people for their role.",
      "Kerry Condon, who portrays Kate McKenna, the technical director for team APXGP, tells TODAY.com she drew inspiration from Bernie Collins, an F1 strategy analyst for Sky Sports and F1TV and former F1 strategy engineer for the Aston Martin F1 team.",
      "\u201cWe did take a bit of an artistic license where I play a strategist in certain parts of the movie with the tires and stuff,\u201d Condon says. \u201cI was like, I\u2019ll just do everything. But Bernie had a similar education to me, (went to an) all-girls school and stuff, so I kind of brought in a lot of my own background and made it my own.\u201d",
      "Bardem says Ruben was not inspired by anyone in particular, but more of \u201ca mix of different team owners that I would meet or see on documentaries and and just put them together.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1 The Movie\u201d is in theaters on June 27."

Navigating an already lengthy visa process for Iranian students had been difficult enough, he said, only for his future to be thrown into limbo by the ban and then the U.S. bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites over the weekend.",

Most recently, after the U.S. helped negotiate a ceasefire that went into effect Tuesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made a televised speech Thursday, breaking a weeklong silence. In the speech, Khamenei claimed victory over Israel and said that Iran had delivered a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to the U.S.",
      "The U.S. strikes came weeks after Trump announced in a proclamation early this month that Iran would be among 12 countries whose nationals would be fully restricted from entering the U.S. Seven other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "The proclamation said that several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals, while others had high visa overstay rates. In Iran\u2019s case, the administration said that the entry of its nationals had been suspended because it is a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News earlier this month that Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "Enayati said that he was crestfallen by the visa ban \u2014 an emotion that only heightened after the recent U.S. strikes. Enayati, who began the visa process in 2023, had been looking forward to a Ph.D. position at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. He said he\u2019s endured half a dozen visa application rejections. His seventh and final application was placed in administrative processing by the U.S. Embassy where it has remained for more than a year, he said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump travel ban came and it ruined everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI really want to experience the American dream.\u201d",
      "After pouring money and time into the application and visa process, Enayati said it\u2019s difficult to entertain any possible future that doesn\u2019t include an education in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand banning us,\u201d said Enayati, who currently lives in Iran. \u201cWe all have a problem with the Iranian regime, but we are just common people.\u201d",
      "As of the 2023-24 school year, 12,430 Iranian students were enrolled in U.S. universities. The lion\u2019s share of students pursued studies in STEM, particularly in engineering,",
      "Amy Malek, chair of the Iranian and Persian Gulf studies program at Oklahoma State University, said that Iranian students have long been subjected to particularly long processing times and intensive scrutiny when it comes to obtaining visas. She said the demographic was once the largest proportion of international students in the late 1970s, reaching a peak of 51,310 students in the U.S. However, due to geopolitical tensions, those from Iran faced additional screenings and restrictions for decades, she said.",
      "A law under the Obama administration, for example, denied visas to Iranian students whose studies would prepare them for energy or nuclear sectors in their home country. And under the first Trump administration, Iran was among the seven Muslim-majority countries whose nationals were banned from entering the U.S. The ban was lifted under Joe Biden in 2021.",
      "Today, Iranian students often experience significantly longer wait times than those from other countries, with the visa process sometimes taking months to years \u2014 several times longer than the average wait of days to weeks. But, Malek said, many seeking education in the U.S. have historically few ties to political activism or are in opposition to Iran\u2019s ruling theocracy.",
      "\u201cThere is a long-term misunderstanding, or perhaps unwillingness, to see Iranian citizens as separate from their government,\u201d Malek said. \u201cI do think that the U.S. government misses out on opportunities to support the kinds of change that they claim to want for Iran when they undermine the ability for Iranian students to study abroad.\u201d",
      "Abbasian, the cancer researcher, planned to begin her program this year at the University of Missouri. She also said that her studies have always remained strictly academic rather than political. With the ongoing conflict and visa ban threatening students\u2019 future, the restrictions could block opportunities for a generation of scientists, particularly those who may not have the means or time to wait out the indefinite ban, or whose test scores expire while the ban is in effect. Some students will have to resort to continuing their education in other countries or remain in Iran. For Abbasian, she said she\u2019s committed to learning under the University of Missouri\u2019s specific program and is unwilling to give up that goal.",
      "Abbasian, who said she was in shock for days because of the restrictions, said she is determined to find her way to the U.S., speaking out for those in her position and holding out hope for the ban to be lifted at some point.",
      "\u201cNo matter how long this takes, someday I will be in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cI will start my dreams. I believe in my dreams.\u201d"

      "But as a fragile ceasefire holds, cyber defenders in the United States and Israel say they have so far seen little out of the ordinary \u2014 a potential sign that the threat from Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities, like its battered military, has been overestimated.",
      "There has been no indication of the disruptive cyberattacks often invoked during discussions of Iran\u2019s digital capabilities, such as its alleged sabotage of tens of thousands of computers at major oil company Saudi Aramco in 2012, or subsequent break-ins at U.S. casinos or water facilities.",
      "\u201cThe volume of attacks appears to be relatively low,\u201d said Nicole Fishbein, a senior security researcher with the Israeli company Intezer. \u201cThe techniques used are not particularly sophisticated.\u201d",
      "Online vigilante groups alleged by security analysts to be acting at Iran\u2019s direction boasted of hacking a series of Israeli and Western companies in the wake of the airstrikes.",
      "A group calling itself Handala Hack claimed a string of data heists and intrusions, but Reuters was not able to corroborate its most recent hacking claims. Researchers say the group, which emerged in the wake of Palestinian militant group Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, likely operates out of Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence.",

      "Iran\u2018s mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request for comment. Iran typically denies carrying out hacking campaigns.",
      "Israeli firm Check Point Software said a hacking campaign it ties to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards has in recent days sent phishing messages to Israeli journalists, academic officials and others.",

      "The pro-Iranian cyber operations demonstrate an asymmetry with pro-Israeli cyber operations tied to the aerial war that began on June 13.",
      "In the days since the start of the conflict, suspected Israeli hackers have claimed to have destroyed data at one of Iran\u2019s major state-owned banks. They also burned roughly $90 million in cryptocurrencies that the hackers allege were tied to government security services.",

Hospital officials said 18 people were killed.",
      "The strike was the latest violence surrounding the distribution of food to Gaza\u2019s population, which has been thrown into turmoil over the past month. After blocking all food for 2 1/2 months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since mid-May.",
      "Efforts by the United Nations to distribute the food have been plagued by armed gangs looting trucks and by crowds of desperate people offloading supplies from convoys.",
      "The strike in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday appeared to target members of Sahm, a security unit tasked with stopping looters and cracking down on merchants who sell stolen aid at high prices. The unit is part of Gaza\u2019s Hamas-led Interior Ministry, but includes members of other factions.",
      "Witnesses said the Sahm unit was distributing bags of flour and other goods confiscated from looters and corrupt merchants, drawing a crowd when the strike hit.",
      "Video of the aftermath showed bodies, several torn, of multiple young men in the street with blood splattering on the pavement and walls of buildings. The dead included a child and at least seven Sahm members, according to the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where casualties were taken.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has accused the militant Hamas group of stealing aid and using it to prop up its rule in the enclave. Israeli forces have repeatedly struck Gaza\u2019s police, considering them a branch of Hamas.",
      "An association of Gaza\u2019s influential clans and tribes said Wednesday that they had started an independent effort to guard aid convoys to prevent looting. The National Gathering of Palestinian Clans and Tribes said it helped escort a rare shipment of flour that entered northern Gaza that evening.",

      "\u201cWe will no longer allow thieves to steal from the convoys for the merchants and force us to buy them for high prices,\u201d Abu Ahmad al-Gharbawi, a figure involved in the tribal effort, told the AP.",

      "The move by tribes to protect aid convoys brings yet another player in an aid situation that has become fragmented, confused and violent, even as Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million Palestinians struggle to feed their families.",
      "Throughout the more than 20-month-old war, the U.N. led the massive aid operation by humanitarian groups providing food, shelter, medicine and other goods to Palestinians despite the fighting. U.N. and other aid groups say that when significant amounts of supplies are allowed into Gaza, looting and theft dwindles.",
      "Israel, however, seeks to replace the U.N.-led system, saying Hamas has been siphoning off large amounts of supplies from it, a claim the U.N. and other aid groups deny.",
      "Israel has backed an American private contractor, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has started distributing food boxes at four locations, mainly in the far south of Gaza, for the past month.",
      "Thousands of Palestinians walk for hours to reach the hubs, moving through Israeli military zones where witnesses say Israeli troops regularly open fire with heavy barrages to control the crowds.",
      "Health officials say hundreds of people have been killed and wounded. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots.",
      "Israel has continued to allow a smaller number of aid trucks into Gaza for U.N. distribution. The World Health Organization said Thursday that it had been able to deliver its first medical shipment into Gaza since March 2, with nine trucks bringing blood, plasma and other supplies to Nasser Hospital, the biggest hospital still functioning in southern Gaza.",
      "In Gaza City, large crowds gathered Thursday at an aid distribution point to receive bags of flour from the convoy that arrived the previous evening, according to photos taken by a cameraman collaborating with the AP.",
      "Hiba Khalil, a mother of seven, said she cannot afford looted aid that is sold in markets for astronomical prices and was relieved to get flour for the first time in months.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve waited for months without having flour or eating much and our children would always cry,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cThe gangs used to take our shares and the shares of our children who slept hungry and thirsty,\u201d she said.",
      "Separately, Israeli strikes overnight and early Thursday killed at least 28 people across the Gaza Strip, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry.

      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s rare earth risks",
      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

    "summary": "A recent scientific study concluded a woman can run one mile in under 4 minutes. In the coming days, Faith Kipyegon will test that theory on the track.",
    "story": [
      "Last winter, a study startled the running world when a team of researchers concluded that, under the right circumstances, Kenyan superstar Faith Kipyegon could break a barrier long thought impossible \u2014 becoming the first woman to run 1 mile in less than four minutes.",
      "In the coming days, under a worldwide spotlight, that theory will be put to the test.",
      "Kipyegon on Thursday will line up in Paris in a Nike-sponsored race called Breaking4, just four laps \u2014 and 1,609 meters, to be exact \u2014 from history.",
      "If there were ever a runner to make such an attempt, it would be the 31-year-old Kipyegon. A three-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, who holds the world record in the 1,500 meters and formerly held the record at 5,000 meters, as well, she has come closer to the four-minute barrier than anyone. In 2023, racing in Monaco, Kipyegon smashed the previous world record for the mile by running 4:07.64.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really stretching your imagination and acceptance of how women can excel in sport,\u201d said Rodger Kram, an associate professor emeritus at the University of Colorado who co-authored the study published in February in the Royal Society of Open Science.",
      "Yet speed alone won\u2019t make up the 7.64-second difference between her personal best and a barrier-breaking achievement \u2014 a lifetime in a race as short as the mile. The big variable is how exactly Kipyegon will \u201cdraft\u201d off pace-setters around her, thus reducing her aerodynamic drag. How many pacers Nike will use, and what formation they will employ, remains a mystery.",
      "Kipyegon told The Associated Press that \u201cbreaking four will really cement my legacy.\u201d Yet breaking four minutes could lead to a wider effect. Half-marathons and marathons have enjoyed a post-pandemic participation boom, but Kram wonders whether Kipyegon\u2019s example could inspire more women to run middle distances.",
      "\u201cTo see that, one, we actually want to go after a female record, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Shalaya Kipp, a former Olympic distance runner and NCAA champion who co-authored the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to not only draw more females to the sport, but it\u2019s also going to help draw more attention to female physiology and get more research done on females too.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not the runner in me, but that\u2019s the scientist in me that gets really excited if we have this. Scientists are going to start working with more female athletes, and that is a big gap we have right now,\u201d Kipp added.",
      "As experts in physiology and kinesiology, Kram, Kipp and their study\u2019s co-authors, Edson Soares da Silva and Wouter Hoogkamer, were already fans of running. But their pursuit of whether a female sub-four mile was possible began in earnest in 2023 while watching Kipyegon run her 4:07 world record while using pacers for only half the race.",
      "\u201cIt really stood out to us that this was a very fast race \u2014 a world record, of course \u2014 but she had terrible drafting,\u201d said Kipp, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re track nerds, and we watched that, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Well, what if? What if?\u2019 And then we were like, \u2018We actually could do that math.\u2019\u201d",
      "The researchers\u2019 sub-four findings were modeled on a scenario in which Kipyegon would draft off a team of all-female pacers, in part for the gender-breaking symbolism it would represent, Kipp said. In that scenario, the study found that if Kipyegon could stay within about 40 inches behind a pacer in front of her, and 40 inches in front of another behind her \u2014 with a new pacing team swapping in halfway through \u2014 it would create an aerodynamic \u201cpocket\u201d in which she would face the least wind resistance.",
      "Under those conditions, Kipyegon could run 3:59.37, the paper concluded \u2014 the exact time run by Roger Bannister in 1954 when he, using pacers for more than 80% of the race, became the first person to ever break the sub-four barrier.",
      "Less remembered is that also in 1954, Diane Leather became the first woman to break the five-minute barrier in the mile. It took more than half a century for the idea of a woman running a sub-four mile to enter the realm of possibility, however, as training, times and technology all improved.",
      "An inflection point arrived in 2016.",
      "That year, Nike became the first shoe company to combine an exceptionally bouncy new foam with rigid \u201cplates\u201d in its shoes and spikes. Studies have determined such \u201csupershoes\u201d require less effort to run at a given pace by absorbing the impact from each foot strike, allowing runners to rebound more quickly. The breakthrough led Nike to design a different moon shot race, dubbed \u201cBreaking2,\u201d in which Kenyan superstar Eliud Kipchoge attempted to become the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours. He came up 25 seconds short during his first try, in 2017. In his second attempt, three years later, Kipchoge ran 1:59.40. The times do not count as an official world record because the carefully tailored attempt did not meet the standards of the sport\u2019s global governing body, but it represented a seismic shift in what was possible all the same.",
      "It was also a sign of things to come.",
      "\u201cWe opened the 2016 floodgates,\u201d Kipp said, \u201cand we saw these times dropping.\u201d",
      "Of the 50 fastest miles run by women all time, 33 have been run since 2016, including 10 of the top 11. The world record of 4:12.56 had stood since 1996 until Sifan Hassan ran 0.23 seconds faster in 2019. Four years later, Kipyegon shattered Hassan\u2019s world record by a stunning 4.69 seconds in Monaco.",
      "In Paris this week, Kipyegon will wear custom-made Nike supershoe spikes as well as a speed suit and custom bra designed to reduce drag. Kipyegon is unique in that her stride appears effortless, as if floating, Kipp said. Yet what matters most, Kram and Kipp said, is whether Kipyegon has improved at staying tucked in behind her pacers.",
      "Nike did not consult with Kram, Kipp or their research team on the technical details of Kipyegon\u2019s attempt. How the sportswear giant will handle the number and gender of the pacers has led to significant intrigue. Stadiums hosting professional meets feature a metal \u201crail\u201d on the inside of the first lane, separating the track from the infield. Because Paris\u2019 Stade Charlety has little rubberized track surface inside of the rail, it\u2019s unlikely it will have the space needed to use the type of \u201cfull arrowhead\u201d formation it employed in its attempt to help Kipchoge break two hours in the marathon. Kram wonders if Nike will employ a \u201chalf arrowhead\u201d or perhaps even the model the researchers studied, with one in front and one behind.",
      "He and Kipp will also be watching for how Kipyegon and her pacers line up at the start; how relaxed she appears while pushing an unprecedented pace; and, nearing the finish, when the pacers will peel away to allow Kipyegon to finish alone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be watching to make sure that she\u2019s in the pocket, and that the pacers don\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Kram said. \u201cIn the first 200 [meters] you can ruin your chances for the mile. If she goes out and runs 27 [seconds], she\u2019s cooked. She\u2019s got to go out in 29, 29-high.",
      "\u201cIf she comes through 1,200 in three minutes, I think she\u2019s going to get it. Other people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s when she\u2019s going to die.\u2019 But I believe in our numbers and our calculations.\u201d",
      "Kipchoge and his training partners wore T-shirts featuring \u201cBreaking4\u201d and Kipyegon\u2019s image during training recently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor for us to support [Kipyegon] as she prepares to achieve the unthinkable and to break down the barriers of human performance,\u201d Kipchoge wrote on Instagram. \u201cFaith is a true inspiration for our world. If there\u2019s one person to do it, it is you. Go for it!\u201d",
      "The race also comes at a significant moment for Nike itself. The company\u2019s roots are in running \u2014 it was founded by a middle-distance runner, Phil Knight, and his collegiate track coach \u2014 and more runners finished distance races in 2024 wearing the brand than any other, according to an industry group survey. In recent years, however, Nike\u2019s shelf space and market share among running shoes has been challenged by newcomers such as Hoka and On. Kipyegon\u2019s sub-four attempt will come on the same day that Nike is scheduled to host a quarterly earnings call.",
      "In the days before Kipyegon\u2019s race, Kram acknowledged having nerves over how the study\u2019s findings would fare in a real-life test. Many of his previous studies had received scant attention from the wider public, he said. February\u2019s sub-four paper, by comparison, had drawn global attention.",
      "\u201cEven if we don\u2019t go below four, how exciting is it just to have this attempt?\u201d Kipp said. \u201cIs it really going to be a failure if she runs, you know, 4:01, 4:02? It\u2019s still going to be a big deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s first sub-two [marathon] attempt was. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it lowered the standard, and it made us realize if we can get closer, we can do it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Costa Rica\u2019s Constitutional Court on Tuesday ordered the government of Rodrigo Chaves to release Asian migrants deported by the Trump administration who have been held in a temporary shelter in the Central American country since February.",
      "In a 4-3 vote, the justices found that the Costa Rican government had violated the migrants\u2019 rights by failing to provide them with \u201ctimely and sufficient information\u201d about their immigration status or give them access to legal counsel. \u201cNor was free contact with the media permitted, nor was there any information from the outset about the possibility of requesting asylum,\u201d the court said in a statement.",
      "The judges gave the government 15 days to release the deported migrants and ordered it to determine their immigration status \u201cindividually\u201d and based on the law.",
      "In February, the Trump administration sent 200 Asian migrants to Costa Rica on two deportation flights, including nearly 100 children. The deportees came from countries such as China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Russia and Uzbekistan. More than 70 were minors.",
      "The agreement between the two countries was reached as Costa Rica feared that President Donald Trump would retaliate if it refused to accept the migrants, according to statements made to the press by the president and the foreign minister.",
      "The deportees were immediately taken to the Temporary Migrant Care Center (CATEM), in the canton of Corredores, 7 miles from the border with Panama. They slept cramped in shared, poorly ventilated bunks in a hot, humid region where temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "As of Tuesday, 28 people remained deported, including 13 minors, from Armenia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran, Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s deputy minister of the interior and police, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "The vast majority of the deportees, 107, were repatriated to their countries of origin. Another 35 left the center on their own, and 30 requested asylum in Costa Rica, Badilla said.",
      "Costa Rican authorities described the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling as a \u201cserious error\u201d and asserted that the migrants still there \u201cenjoy complete freedom; they can leave and move freely,\u201d according to Badilla.",
      "\u201c(The constitutional ruling) makes no sense. For months, these people have had regular immigration status and complete freedom of movement,\u201d the official said.",
      "\"From our perspective, the Constitutional Court is mistaken and making a serious error. It clearly doesn\u2019t understand the current situation at CATEM,\u201d he added.",
      "The constitutional ruling responds to a habeas corpus petition against the Costa Rican government filed by the country\u2019s former minister of communications, Mauricio Herrera.",
      "In late April, Costa Rica granted humanitarian immigration status to the migrants held at the shelter after a group of human rights lawyers filed a lawsuit against the country before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, alleging that the government had violated the rights of 81 migrant minors by detaining them at the shelter without legal counsel or access to education or psychological services.",
      "At the time, Costa Rican authorities announced that the migrants, whose passports were confiscated upon arrival in the country, would receive their documents back and were free to leave the shelter and seek options to leave Costa Rica or seek asylum if they so desired.",
      "In April, Noticias Telemundo visited CATEM and spoke with some of the migrants, including a 36-year-old Russian, German Smirnov, who was deported with his wife and 6-year-old son. Smirnov, originally from St. Petersburg, said he had worked in his country as an electoral official and witnessed how elections were manipulated in Russia. He said he sought out the organization of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in a Siberian prison in 2024, to report fraud in the 2024 elections, but authorities under Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime discovered him.",
      "\"They\u2019ll put me in jail or send me to war\" if he returns to Russia, Smirnov said. \"It\u2019s simple, because my country is at war with a neighboring country.\u201d",
      "Help the powerful brother of the north",
      "In announcing the agreement with the United States, Chaves said  Costa Rica was helping its \u201ceconomically powerful brother to the north\u201d and indicated that it feared punishment if it did not accept the migrants.",
      "\u201cIf they impose a tax on our free trade zones, they\u2019ll screw us,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it, thank God. ... Love is repaid with love. ... Two hundred come, we treat them well and they leave,\" he said at a news conference.",
      "Costa Rican Foreign Minister Arnoldo Andr\u00e9 Tinoco also expressed the country\u2019s fear of Trump\u2019s \u201cpressure,\u201d although he denied that it had materialized.",
      "What Chavez meant, Andr\u00e9 said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo in late March, \"was that, through a gesture of goodwill, we would somewhat alleviate the pressure if the United States were thinking of imposing some kind of restriction that doesn\u2019t interest us. Of course, we\u2019re not interested.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure. Possibility? Of course it exists. Yes. Look at what the new U.S. administration is doing around the world. ... You\u2019re not going to get me to say that I was pressured by the United States because that\u2019s not true,\u201d he asserted.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, broke his weeklong silence Thursday, claiming in a televised speech that his country had secured a victory over Israel and delivered a \"slap in the face\" to Washington.",
      "Hours earlier, Iran's government also approved legislation to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a move that will stymie efforts to assess the damage from U.S. airstrikes and monitor uranium enrichment.",
      "\u201cThe Islamic Republic emerged victorious and, in return, delivered a harsh slap to America\u2019s face,\u201d Khamenei said after eight days of silence.",
      "The United States had \u201centered a direct war\u201d because it felt like Israel would be \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d if it didn\u2019t, he said, adding that \u201cit gained nothing from this war.\u201d Israel \"had to understand that attacking Iran would come at a heavy cost and thanks to God, that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel's strikes have killed a slew of top Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists. There is still debate, within the U.S. and internationally, about the extent of the damage of American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Khamenei claimed that \"the Americans failed to achieve anything significant in their attack on nuclear facilities.\" On assertions by President Donald Trump that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated,\" the supreme leader added, \"It\u2019s clear that the American president needs to exaggerate, they resort to exaggeration to cover up the truth.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the Iranian Parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation with only one abstention among the 223 lawmakers and none voting against it. Thursday saw the bill's approval by the country's powerful Guardian Council, which includes theologians selected by the supreme leader.",
      "\"Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program will continue with greater speed,\" Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said later. While Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said the bill \u201cis a clear response to the illegal attacks against our country.\"",
      "It would mean IAEA inspectors \u201cwill not be allowed entry into the country unless the security of nuclear sites and the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities are guaranteed,\u201d he said. And any inspections would also be \u201csubject to approval by the Supreme National Security Council,\u201d he added.",
      "It would thwart efforts by IAEA Director Rafael Grossi, who told the French radio station RFI that he was \"enormously\" concerned at the development.",
      "\"The agency\u2019s presence in Iran is not some kind of generous gesture,\" he said. \"It is an international responsibility.\"",
      "The CIA has cited credible intelligence that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d While a Defense Intelligence Agency initial assessment leaked Tuesday found it may have only been set back several months, less than claimed by Trump.",
      "At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed a \"historically successful strike\" and criticized the media for what he said were overly negative reports of the strikes.",
      "Iran says it is not trying to build a nuclear weapon, and it had been complying with the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, which most experts said was successful in limiting its program, until that was effectively axed by Trump in 2018.",
      "After that, Iran began enriching uranium to much higher grades, more than needed for energy and approaching the potency required for a bomb, the IAEA said.",
      "Grossi also said the country, as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is required have an inspection system.",
      "\"It is a legal obligation from the point of view of international law, which cannot be suspended unilaterally,\" he said. \"I hope that will not be the case, because otherwise we would be on the verge of a new major crisis.\"",
      "This 1970 international agreement says that any signatory is barred from developing a nuclear weapon and must be subject to IAEA inspections. Iran, which signed the deal in 1968, says it does not have nuclear weapons; Israel, which is estimated to have around 90 warheads, has never signed the pact.",
      "Iran hard-liners in Washington and elsewhere have been pushing to impose a \u201czero enrichment\u201d ban on Iran \u2014 meaning it would be prevented even from using enriched uranium for nuclear power. Iranian officials point to these arguments as reasons why the country should renege.",
      "\u201cIf we are to remain a member of this treaty, we cannot accept only its obligations while being deprived of the rights it guarantees,\u201d Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Baghaei said Wednesday. \u201cThese rights are clearly defined: the right to peaceful nuclear energy for non-military purposes.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. \u201cIran is ready to cooperate in enhancing regional security and strengthening peace and stability,\u201d Pezeshkian said, according to state media. \u201cWe support the establishment of a region free of nuclear weapons and even weapons of mass destruction.\u201d"
