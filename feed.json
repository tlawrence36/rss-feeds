      "Jacques Agbobly has only been in the fashion business for five years",
      "NEW YORK -- When the email came from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jacques Agbobly at first didn\u2019t quite believe it.",
      "The Brooklyn-based fashion designer had only been in the business for five years. Now, one of the world\u2019s top museums was asking for two of his designs to be shown in \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d the exhibit launched by the starry Met Gala.",
      "\u201cI was just floored with excitement,\u201d Agbobly said in an interview. \u201cI had to check to make sure it was from an official email. And then the excitement came, and I was like \u2026 am I allowed to say anything to anyone about it?\"",
      "Agbobly grew up in Togo, watching seamstresses and tailors create beautiful garments in part of the family home that they rented out. Studying fashion later in New York, the aspiring designer watched the Met Gala carpet from afar and dreamed of one day somehow being part of it.",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Costume Institute exhibit to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Unlike past shows that highlighted the work of very famous designers like Karl Lagerfeld or Charles James, this exhibit includes a number of up-and-coming designers like Agbobly.",
      "\u201cThe range is phenomenal,\u201d says guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard College professor whose book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d is a foundation for the show.",
      "\u201cIt's super exciting to showcase the designs of these younger and emerging designers,\u201d says Miller, who took a reporter through the show over the weekend before its unveiling at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cand to see the way they've been thinking about Black representation across time and across geography.\u201d",
      "The exhibit covers Black style over several centuries, but the unifying theme is dandyism, and how designers have expressed that ethos through history.",
      "For Agbobly, dandyism is \u201cabout taking space. As a Black designer, as a queer person, a lot of it is rooted in people telling us who we should be or how we should act \u2026 dandyism really goes against that. It\u2019s about showing up and looking your best self and taking up space and announcing that you're here.\"",
      "The exhibit begins with its own definition: someone who \u201cstudies above everything else to dress elegantly and fashionably.\u201d",
      "Miller has organized it into 12 conceptual sections: Ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "The ownership section begins with two livery coats, worn by slaves.",
      "One of them, from Maryland, looks lavish and elaborate, in purple velvet trimmed with gold metallic threading. The garments were intended to show the wealth of their owners. In other words, Miller says, the slaves themselves were items of conspicuous consumption.",
      "The other is a livery coat of tan broadcloth, likely manufactured by Brooks Brothers and worn by an enslaved child or adolescent boy in Louisiana just before the Civil War.",
      "Elsewhere, there's a contemporary, glittering ensemble by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, made of crushed silk velvet and embroidered with crystals and the cowrie shells historically used as currency in Africa.",
      "There's also a so-called \u201cdollar bill suit\u201d by the label 3.Paradis \u2014 the jacket sporting a laminated one-dollar bill stitched to the breast pocket, meant to suggest the absence of wealth.",
      "The disguise section includes a collection of 19th-century newspaper ads announcing rewards for catching runaway slaves.",
      "The ads, Miller notes, would often describe someone who was \u201cparticularly fond of dress\u201d \u2014 or note that the slave had taken large wardrobes. The reason was twofold: the fancy clothes made it possible for a slave to cloak their identity. But also, when they finally made it to freedom, former slaves could sell the clothing to help fund their new lives, Miller says.",
      "\u201cSo dressing above one\u2019s station sometimes was a matter of life and death,\u201d the curator says, \u201cand also enabled people to transition from being slaves to being liberated.\"",
      "The contemporary part of this section includes striking embroidered jackets by the label Off-White that purposely play with gender roles \u2014 like displaying an ostensibly \u201cmale\u201d jacket on a female mannequin.",
      "Stopping by a set of portraits from the early 19th century, as abolitionism was happening in the North, Miller explains that the subjects are Black men who were successful, well off enough to commission or sit for portraits, and dressed \u201cin the finest fashions of the day.\" Like William Whipper, an abolitionist and wealthy lumber merchant who also founded a literary society.",
      "They represent the beginnings of a Black middle and upper middle class in America, Miller says. But she points out a group of racist caricatures in a case right across from the portraits.",
      "\u201cAlmost as soon as they are able to do this,\" she says, referring to the portraits, \u201cthey are stereotyped and degraded.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, Miller points out, was not only a civil rights activist but also one of the best-dressed men in turn-of-the-century America. He traveled extensively overseas, which meant he needed \u201cclothing befitting his status as a representative of Black America to the world.\u201d",
      "Objects in the display include receipts for tailors in London, and suit orders from Brooks Brothers or his Harlem tailor. There is also a laundry receipt from 1933 for cleaning of shirts, collars, and handkerchiefs.",
      "Also highlighted in this section: Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist, writer, and statesman and also \u201cthe most photographed man of the 19th century.\u201d",
      "The show includes his tailcoat of brushed wool, as well as a shirt embroidered with a \u201cD\u201d monogram , a top hat, a cane and a pair of sunglasses.",
      "One of Miller\u2019s favorite items in the \u201cheritage\u201d section is Agbobly\u2019s bright-colored ensemble based on the hues of bags that West African migrants used to transport their belongings.",
      "Also displayed is Agbobly\u2019s denim suit embellished with crystals and beads. It's a tribute not only to the hairbraiding salons where the designer spent time as a child, but also the earrings his grandmother or aunts would wear when they went to church.",
      "Speaking of family, Agbobly says that he ultimately did tell them \u2014 and everyone \u2014 about his \u201cpinch-me moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone knows about it,\u201d the designer says. \u201cI keep screaming. If I can scream on top of a hill, I will.\u201d",

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \u201cShe wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\u201d",

If he doesn't abide by the conditions, he faces being remanded in custody.",
      "The comedian, author and \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor, who wore an open shirt and jeans, listened intently to the details of the charges as he sat in the dock. He spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, address and that he understood his bail conditions.",

Brand is alleged to have grabbed her by the face with both hands, pushed her against a wall and kissed her before grabbing her breasts and buttocks.",
      "The charges follow a September 2023 joint investigation by British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times.",
      "Known for his unbridled and risqu\u00e9 standup routines, Brand hosted shows on radio and television and wrote memoirs charting his battles with drugs and alcohol. He has appeared in several Hollywood movies and was briefly married to pop star Katy Perry between 2010 and 2012.",
      "In recent years, Brand has largely disappeared from mainstream media but has built up a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories. He recently said he had moved to the United States.",

    "story": [
      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting.",
      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets \u201creceive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS\u2019 CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rescind funding for public media would \u201cdisrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\u201d",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",
      "Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.",
      "The move against PBS and NPR comes as his administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.",

      "\u201cI was like \u2018What? Like, no way,'\" Hauldren recalled. \u201cI, like, had to do my research for myself.\u201d",
      "Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.",
      "Crow-Armstrong's girlfriend has a cousin who is friends with the girlfriend of PJ Carberry, another member of Levity.",
      "\u201cMy girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona,\u201d Crow-Armstrong said. \u201cI had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it.\u201d",
      "Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June's \u201cStill Boomin\u201d for his walkup song. He said he isn't a big fan of dubstep \u2014 the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time \u2014 but he likes Levity's stuff.",
      "Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrong's daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song.",
      "\u201cMusic\u2019s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong\u2019s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.",
      "But he was always a Cubs fan.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.\u201d",
      "The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.",
      "Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of \u201cFront to Back\u201d at their place in Bucktown \u2014 not far from Wrigley Field.",
      "\u201cMy window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,\u201d Hauldren said. \u201cAnd so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.\u201d",
      "After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.",
      "Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago's Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.\u201d",

      "This time, Italian American comedians Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco will make their debut during a comical promotion, the network said on Wednesday. The commercial will air during NBC\u2019s Kentucky Derby coverage on Saturday.",
      "In the spot, Romano and Maniscalco stand atop the Italian Alps with snowboards in hand, attempting to discuss thrilling winter sports like skiing, snowboarding and luge. But their discussion is repeatedly sidetracked by their shared obsession with Italian food.",
      "\u201cRay and I teamed up for the Olympics, two Italian guys trying to figure out winter sports,\u201d Maniscalco said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, we thought \u2018luge\u2019 was a type of pasta.\u201d",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

      "Think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d translated to Napoleonic-era France",
      "He\u2019s a dream in the kitchen \u2014 and elsewhere in the house. He makes a mean cream-puff tower. And he\u2019s got moves like Jagger.",
      "Alas, Antonin Car\u00eame has been dead since the 1830s, but nobody\u2019s perfect, right?",
      "Most people have heard of Napoleon, but not many are familiar \u2014 even in France \u2014 with the story of this chef who cooked for him and his contemporaries, rising from a poor kitchen boy to become a standard-bearer of French cuisine. Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",
      "But for the vibe, think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d set in post-revolutionary Paris. Car\u00eame even directs his staff at one point to say \u201cOui, chef.\u201d (And we could totally imagine him, like Jeremy Allen White, in a Calvin Klein underwear ad, if those had existed back then.)",
      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",
      "Still, his goal was to be the best chef in the world. The show\u2019s first season ends with an extraordinary outdoor coronation banquet that Car\u00eame creates for thousands of people. When he places, in triumph, a tall white chef\u2019s hat on his head for the first time, it's as if he's crowning himself \u2014 and marking his ascent to celebrity.",
      "Benjamin Voisin, who's in virtually every scene, plays Car\u00eame with a scruffy head of hair, a gold earring and a bad-boy swagger that's consciously based on Mick Jagger, circa \u201970s.",
      "Director Martin Bourboulon says the choice for the role was obvious once Voisin walked into the audition room.",
      "\u201cWhen you find the right actor for the right part, 80% of the job is done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were very impressed with his youthful attitude but also his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude. He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "Tardy photographers",
      "NEW YORK -- Like all brides, Elana Goldin had high hopes for her wedding photos and video.",
      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",
      "Michelle Jackson, who owns the photo vendor Bambino International based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said some basic questions about equipment can go a long way.",
      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",
      "Each group is assigned a number that's announced when it's time to gather.",
      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",
      "The rowdy bridesmaid, Pinto said. She's somebody who might have had a bit too much Champagne and feels like she should be in charge.",
      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",
      "\u201cDraw me a blueprint of a perfect summer lineup: 2025 is it,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun twist on what a movie like this could be,\u201d says \u201cThunderbolts\u201d director Jake Schreier.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new,\u201d says \u201cSuperman\u201d director James Gunn. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about the robots and the flying dogs and all that stuff. It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople say, like, do you feel pressure and the most pressure I feel is from myself as a fan and to Steven Spielberg, to not disappoint him,\" says \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d director Gareth Edwards. \u201cWeirdly what\u2019s great about doing a Jurassic movie is that everybody knows deep down that like half the reason they\u2019re in this business is because of that film and Steven\u2019s work.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, all but one summer since 2007 broke the $4 billion mark. Since 2020, only one has: 2023, led by \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",
      "\u201cBy the end of this summer, hopefully people aren\u2019t talking about being in a funk anymore and it feels like we got our mojo back and we\u2019re off to the races,\" Kosinski, who directed the pandemic-era hit \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d says.",

    "story": [
      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "The retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.",
      "Weinstein's attorneys have argued that all three accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "It was an unusual study about trust, vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Denver parents got texts during this winter\u2019s brutal flu season with videos sharing why people in their neighborhoods chose flu shots for their kids, an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "But no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed -- and researchers aren\u2019t the only ones upset.",
      "\u201cFor someone like me, from the Black community who income-wise is on the lower end, we don\u2019t often have a voice,\u201d said Denver mom Chantyl Busby, one of the study\u2019s community advisers. \u201cHaving this funding taken away from this project sends a horrible, horrible message. It\u2019s almost like telling us all over again that our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "How to talk about vaccines with parents \u2013 or anyone \u2013 is taking on new urgency: At least 216 U.S. children died of flu this season, the worst pediatric toll in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children are fueling one of the country's largest measles outbreaks in decades, and another vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 whooping cough \u2014 is soaring, too.",
      "At the same time Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questions vaccines long proven to be safe and effective. Moves by the Trump administration are making it increasingly uncertain that COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall. And the administration has slashed funding for public health and medical research, including abruptly stopping studies of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand what it is that is creating this challenge to vaccines and why,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and worries the country is entering \u201cscientific dark ages.\"",
      "At Denver Health, Dr. Joshua Williams is a pediatrician who every day has vaccine conversations with confused or worried parents. Some even ask if they\u2019ll get kicked out of his practice for refusing immunizations.",
      "Nope, Williams says: Building trust takes time.",
      "\u201cThe most satisfying vaccine-related encounters I have are the ones in families who had significant concerns for a long time, came to trust me over the years as I cared for broken arms and ear infections \u2013 and ultimately vaccinated their child,\u201d he said.",
      "But in the TikTok age, Williams wondered if digital storytelling \u2013 seeing and hearing what led other families to choose vaccination \u2013 might help those decisions. He chose flu shots as the test case \u2014 just under half of U.S. children got one this season. And Black children are among those most at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.",
      "With a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Williams partnered with Denver\u2019s nonprofit Center for African American Health to host workshops bringing volunteers together to discuss how influenza and the flu vaccine had impacted their lives. Professionals helped those who wanted to go the extra step turn them into 2- to 3-minute polished videos.",
      "After two years of community engagement, five of those videos were part of the pilot study sending text messages to 200 families who get care at two Denver Health clinics.",
      "In one video, a mother described getting her first flu vaccination along with her young daughter, making her own health decisions after leaving a controlling relationship.",
      "In another, a grandmother explained how she\u2019ll never again miss a vaccine appointment after her grandson spent his 4th birthday hospitalized with the flu.",
      "Seeing \u201cpeople that they look like, that they sound like, who have experiences they\u2019ve been through that can go, \u2018Hey, I felt like you felt but this changed my life,\u2019\u201d is powerful, said Busby, who OK'd her kids' flu vaccinations after questioning Williams during multiple family checkups.",
      "The study's sudden cancellation means Williams can\u2019t assess if the texted videos influenced families' vaccine decisions \u2013 lost data from more than two years of work and already-spent NIH dollars. It also jeopardizes the researchers' careers. While considering next steps, Williams has asked permission of community members to use some of the videos in his own practice as he discusses vaccination.",
      "Williams gets personal, too, telling families that his kids are vaccinated and how his 95-year-old grandmother reminisces about the terror of polio during her own childhood before those vaccinations were developed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the collective memory about what it\u2019s like to have these diseases in our community,\u201d Williams said, ruefully noting the ongoing measles outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a collective voice from the community saying this is important, to remind those in power that we need to be allocating resources to infection prevention and vaccine hesitancy research.\u201d",

      "There are likely several contributors to this season's severity, but a big one is that fewer children get flu shots, added O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "The flu vaccination rate for U.S. children has plummeted from about 64% five years ago to 49% this season.",
      "Flu vaccinations may not prevent people from coming down with symptoms, but research shows they are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, O'Leary said, adding that the decline in vaccinations \u201cis certainly playing a role\" in this season's loss of life.",
      "The season has not only been hard on children. CDC officials have described it as \u201c highly severe,\u201d and estimate that so far there have been at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths this season.",

    "summary": "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
    "story": [
      "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian ex-President Jair Bolsonaro, who continues to recover after undergoing bowel surgery, has left intensive care, his doctors said Thursday.",
      "The medical team at the DF Star Hospital in Brasilia said that he left intensive care on Wednesday and there is no set discharge date from the facility. His health condition is stable and he has begun receiving a liquid diet.",
      "Bolsonaro underwent a 12-hour surgery on April 13 to remove intestinal adhesions and reconstruct the abdominal wall. It was the sixth procedure related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in September 2018.",
      "He has been in and out of hospitals since the attack and underwent multiple surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.",
      "Doctors described the latest surgery as the \u201cmost complex\u201d since the stabbing, requiring a \u201cvery delicate and prolonged post-surgery.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro was admitted with severe abdominal pain to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, on April 11 and then transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. His family later requested his transfer to Brasilia.",
      "He had been preparing for a trip across northeast Brazil to promote his Liberal Party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running. The region traditionally has been a political bastion of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Bolsonaro is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court for allegedly attempting to stage a coup in January 2023, with riots led by his supporters in Brasilia.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is again trying to rehire some staffers who were recently fired amid mass layoffs at the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors.",
      "More than 20 of the agency\u2019s roughly 60 travel staff will be reinstated, according to two FDA staffers notified of the plan this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation.",
      "The same uncertainty hangs over employees who process agency records for release to lawyers, companies and journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. About 100 of those staffers were recently eliminated, according to an agency official with direct knowledge of the situation.",
      "But in recent days the FDA has missed multiple court-ordered deadlines to produce documents, which could result in hefty fines. That's prompted plans to bring back a significant number of those staffers.",
      "The apparent reversals are the latest examples of the haphazard approach to agency cuts that have shrunk FDA\u2019s workforce by an estimated 20%, or about 3,500 jobs, in addition to an unspecified number of retirements, voluntary buyouts and resignations.",
      "In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days after pushback from industry, Congress and other parties.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services hasn't detailed exactly which positions or programs were cut in the mass layoffs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has repeatedly said that no FDA scientists were fired as part of the reductions. But at least two dozen food scientists who worked in a San Francisco testing laboratory and a Chicago research center were let go in March.",
      "An HHS spokesperson suggested the apparent mix-up was due to \u201cthe fractured, outdated HR infrastructure we inherited from the Biden administration and are now actively overhauling.\u201d The spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about which employees are being reinstated but said the administration will \u201cstreamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us.\u201d",
      "About 15 scientists working in FDA\u2019s Division of Food Processing Science and Technology in Chicago were told last week they be will reinstated, according to a staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But a week later there has been no written confirmation and the scientists have not returned to the office. The group\u2019s research includes studying ways to prevent harmful bacteria from growing on produce and preventing the spread of microplastics and other particles from food packaging.",
      "\u201cI hope Commissioner Makary continues to assess these ill-informed cuts and works to bring back impacted employees expeditiously,\u201d said Susan Mayne of Yale University, the FDA\u2019s former food director. \u201cHis legacy as commissioner is on the line.\u201d",
      "With more than 15,000 employees remaining across various U.S. and foreign offices, the FDA\u2019s core responsibilities are reviewing new drugs, medical products and food ingredients as well as inspecting thousands of factories.",
      "Makary has said no inspectors or medical reviewers were fired as part of the recent reductions. But current and former FDA officials note that those frontline employees are often supported by teams of administrative staff.",
      "FDA inspectors, for example, have long relied on travel bookers to coordinate trips to India and other countries that often involve visa permissions, security measures, ground transportation, tech support, translation services and other logistics. Inspectors can spend up to half the year traveling, a grueling workload that makes recruiting and retaining staff a challenge.",
      "For a brief period last month, inspectors were told they would be booking their own travel. The FDA set up a hotline to assist with making the arrangements. Then, agency leaders developed a plan to hire an outside contractor to perform the work.",
      "On Monday, staffers were informed that about a third of the fired staff who performed the work would be returning.",

      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to provisional data posted Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That\u2019s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.",
      "The maternal mortality rate rose to 19 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 18.6 the year before.",
      "The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.",
      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.",
      "But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, experts say. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.",
      "The U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found wide racial disparities in such deaths, with Black women dying at a far higher rate than white women.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",
      "In March, Texas filed criminal charges against a Houston midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions, and the state is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",

      "Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill Tuesday. The measure now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against the fluoridation of community water systems, arguing high levels could pose a risk to children\u2019s intellectual development.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water is considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "\u201cAs dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it\u2019s a real tragedy when policymakers\u2019 decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,\u201d Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cBlindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy.\u201d",
      "While Florida's bill doesn't specifically reference fluoride, it will require the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state, said bill sponsor Republican state Rep. Kaylee Tuck.",
      "\u201cAnything that relates to water quality, removing contaminants, things like that, we're not touching that,\" Tuck said. \"It's anything that has to do with health. So fluoride, vitamins, whatever else it is.\u201d",
      "Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month, approving legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride has come under increased scrutiny under the influence of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",
      "Some local officials in Florida have already voted to remove the mineral from their community water systems, ahead of state lawmakers' push to ban fluoride.",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Tuesday she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the passage of the bill, adding that it disregards \u201cthe overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\u201d",
      "Levine Cava said that ending fluoridation, which is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay, will have \u201clong-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\u201d",

      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly approved paid sick leave laws last year",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska were asked last year whether they wanted to require employers to provide paid sick leave to their workers. They overwhelmingly said yes.",
      "Now some lawmakers in each of those states are trying to roll back the benefits, citing concerns from businesses about costs.",
      "The efforts mark the latest attempt by legislators to alter laws backed by the voters they represent. In February, for example, Michigan enacted revisions to a paid sick leave law initiated by voters seven years ago, delaying the date when small businesses must comply and allowing a longer period before new employees are eligible.",
      "Though some voters are outraged, some lawmakers contend that citizen activists who crafted the initiatives overlooked the realities of running a business.",
      "Restaurant owner Tim Hart, who employs about two dozen workers at his steakhouse in Hannibal, Missouri, said the paid sick leave requirement imposes a double financial hit because he must pay one person to stay home and another to fill the shift.",
      "\u201cWhen this goes into effect, we very likely won\u2019t survive,\u201d said Hart, who has urged the state Senate to halt the law.",
      "The paid sick leave laws are set to kick in Thursday in Missouri, July 1 in Alaska and Oct. 1 in Nebraska.",
      "McDonald's restaurant worker Richard Eiker is among those who stand to benefit. He signed a petition putting the initiative on the Missouri ballot and traveled recently from Kansas City to the state Capitol to lobby lawmakers to let the law stand.",
      "In 40 years on the job, Eiker has never received paid sick leave \u2014 not even when he was struggling with a kidney stone.",
      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",
      "But many workers already have it tough, Democratic lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck, just missing a little bit of work can really put them behind,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Patty Lewis said.",
      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",
      "Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, which supported the ballot measure, doubts Ruffridge\u2019s bill will gain traction in the final weeks of this year's session.",
      "But, she said, \u201cI believe this is the beginning of a long battle to protect the voters\u2019 wishes from the wills and the whims of the businesspeople who don\u2019t want to pay sick days.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI come to entrust myself to a higher power, for the things that I can\u2019t solve myself,\u201d Cufaro said after Mass at San Paolo as tears welled in his eyes remembering Francis\u2019 outreach.",
      "The pontiff, who died on April 21 at age 88, visited the parish in 2018, and comforted a child worried about whether his recently deceased atheist father would be in in heaven.",
      "\u201cWe need a pope who comes to visit us, to see the situation,\u201d said Ida Di Giovannantonio, who recalled meeting Francis on that visit.",
      "She said she cried every day when she moved to the projects four decades ago, when she was in her 40s, and only felt safe going to the parish.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a place of refuge. The poor need welcoming and love,\u201d said Di Giovannantonio, who\u2019s also volunteered with the church\u2019s food bank. On Sunday, a shopping cart stood by the church\u2019s entrance with a sign encouraging the faithful to leave food donations.",
      "Less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) away but in a different socioeconomic world, at Santa Maria in the riverside neighborhood of Trastevere, Lisa Remondino said she hopes the next pope will continue Francis\u2019 legacy, especially in helping migrants.",
      "\u201cI hope it will be a welcoming pope, and also a pope who has the courage to fight for peace. He was the only voice we had against war, the powerful, and arms,\u201d said the kindergarten teacher, who belongs to the Catholic charity Sant\u2019Egidio that has worked closely with Francis to help migrants and refugees.",
      "One of the cardinals considered top contenders to succeed him, the Rev. Matteo Zuppi of Rome, has served in various capacities both at Sant\u2019Egidio and close-by Santa Maria, whose foundation dates to the 3rd century.",
      "In the outside portico decorated with ancient marble inscriptions and swarming with tourists, Marta Finati said she hoped that the church would continue to respect dogmas, but also be open to the wider society.",
      "The next pope should embrace a moral and political leadership for peace that would provide a \u201creference point\u201d for non-Catholics too, she added.",
      "Rushing to change into an altar server robes at Sunday afternoon\u2019s Mass at Santa Maria, Mathieu Dansoko, who came to Italy from Mali a decade ago, said coming to church is \u201clike being with your family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next pope should have the basic courage to bring the neediest from the peripheries to the center,\u201d he said.",
      "Back on the periphery of Corviale, the parish priest, the Rev. Roberto Cassano, said losing Francis was \u201ca big blow\u201d for his congregation because Pope Francis\u2019 visit had \u201cinterrupted for a moment the marginalization of these people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to get back a bit to God,\u201d he added in the tidy rose garden between the church and the housing block that packs in more than 1,500 families. \u201cSo much meanness, so much egoism, so much selfishness is the fruit also of the lack of God\u2019s presence in people\u2019s lives. \u2026 Different social problems would still exist, but a little less acute.\u201d",
      "At Sunday morning Mass, several faithful stopped by the last pew to greet an occasional visitor \u2013 Cardinal Oswald Gracias of India, who was in Rome for the conclave gatherings, though having turned 80 at the end of last year, he can no longer cast a vote.",
      "Upon election, each cardinal gets a \u201ctitular\u201d parish in Rome, and on Sunday many celebrated Mass at theirs. In his homily, Gracias mentioned the different legacies of the last three popes \u2013 St. John Paul II\u2019s \u201cworld-changing\u201d geopolitical impacts, Benedict XVI\u2019s scholarship, and Francis\u2019 pastoral care. He urged the more than 100 faithful to \u201cpray that the Holy Spirit may give us a pope who meets the needs of the times.\u201d",
      "Elisabetta Bonifazi, who finds in San Paolo her \u201cpoint of reference,\u201d said in a world rife with \u201cwars and contradictions,\u201d the new pope will need all the divine guidance and prayers.",
      "\u201cHe will have to keep carrying this burden forward,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in an extremely difficult moment.\u201d",

      "BUEA, Cameroon -- A woman cried out upon seeing what looked like a corpse, a sheet-covered form lying on a stretcher. As volunteers wheeled it onto the stage, Boris Taleabong Alemnge recited a poem whose title spoke the unspoken: \u201cDeath.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe day you die, people will cry,\u201d the 24-year-old told hundreds of audience members in an embattled part of southwest Cameroon. \u201cBut this won\u2019t stop the clock from ticking or the flowers from blooming.\u201d",
      "Alemnge is among a group of artists using spoken-word poetry to denounce ongoing bloodshed in Cameroon\u2019s English-speaking regions, where separatists are fighting government forces. The supposed corpse was a stage prop, but the tears and wails that greeted it were real.",
      "The civil war has killed an estimated 6,500 people, a majority of them civilians, and displaced nearly 1 million since 2016.",
      "Spoken word has gained new prominence in Cameroon as poets like Alemnge, who performs under the stage name \u201cPenboy,\u201d believe their art form taps into the everyday dangers of war zones that many people avoid talking about.",
      "\u201cDeath is inevitable, yet many people don\u2019t even want to think about it,\u201d he said after a performance he organized in March to launch his latest album, \u201cRED.\u201d",
      "Artists have found eager audiences who say they feel moved by the rhythms of the spoken word.",
      "\u201cI have watched crowds fall silent, then rise like waves, because his words have the power to heal,\u201d said Prosper Langmi Ngunu, who watched Penboy\u2019s performance.",
      "Almost everyone in Anglophone areas has lost someone close to them. Mental health issues are common. So, too, is gang rape by members of the warring parties, contributing to a rise in teenage pregnancy.",
      "\u201cRED\u201d returns to the themes of Penboy\u2019s first album, \u201cNatives of the Universe,\u201d which advocates that people share common humanity and fight for reasons of vanity that don\u2019t justify the human cost.",
      "Despite the linguistic divides deepened by the conflict, Penboy has toured six of Cameroon\u2019s eight Francophone regions to draw people\u2019s attention to atrocities committed in English-speaking regions. There, he said, his poems found empathetic audiences and even turned some listeners into advocates for peace.",
      "International and local organizations have documented looting, killing and torture as well as mass rape and the burning of villages. The warring sides often trade blame for such abuses.",
      "The scars of colonial rule shape discord in modern-day Cameroon along linguistic fault lines. Once a German colony, Cameroon was divided between Britain and France after World War I. They ruled it as two separate entities until the early 1960s, when Cameroon became independent and united as a single, federal, bilingual state.",
      "The arrangement was short-lived. The following decade, Cameroon passed a referendum amending its constitution and dissolving sections guaranteeing the rights of the English-speaking minority.",
      "The English-speaking population makes up about 20% of the country\u2019s roughly 30 million people. They feel marginalized by the Francophone majority. Tensions spiked in 2016 when the government attempted to impose French in English-speaking regions\u2019 schools and courts, igniting protests that security forces violently repressed.",
      "The clashes prompted some English-speaking separatists to take up arms against the government. Both sides have been accused of violence against civilians.",
      "The growing popularity of spoken-word events like Penboy\u2019s March 9 gathering reflects how people are becoming less afraid to express their outrage, said another spoken-word artist who goes by Camila.",
      "\u201cSince we cannot pick guns to fight, we use the power of the spoken word to send across our message. Some find peace in it, others find healing, while some get educated,\u201d she said.",
      "Her performance drew inspiration from an October 2021 attack in which a soldier killed 5-year-old schoolgirl Caro Louise Ndialle after shooting at a car fleeing a checkpoint.",
      "\u201cHow can we forget carrying the lifeless body of our baby girl in our hands with her open skull like a trophy won from a tournament?\u201d Camila asked the audience.",
      "Her poems tap into memories of bodies strewn on city streets, and schools and hospitals that stop operating after government soldiers and separatist fighters burn them to the ground.",
      "Other works lampoon what poets see as hypocrisy and nonchalance by the warring sides.",
      "In \u201cCries Of War,\u201d spoken-word poet and writer Sandra Nyangha tells the story of people fed up with the conflict and eager for a return to peace.",
      "\u201cIf you can give the order for something such as war to start, then you can also give the order to end it,\u201d she said.",
      "For Penboy, spoken-word gatherings are part of efforts to bring the arts to crisis-affected communities. He has also worked on initiatives like the Students In Activism Project, launched last year, to help youth build self-confidence through developing their writing and performances.",
      "The war has robbed many of an education, he said.",
      "\u201cMy goal here is not just to perfect their skills. It is for them to use the art forms to bring solutions to their communities,\u201d Penboy said. \u201cArtists have the responsibility to use their craft to advocate for change.\"",

      "PARIS -- As France prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of the Nazi surrender to Allied forces, survivors of World War II reflect on painful memories of fear, deprivation and persecution shaped by the German occupation of the country and the deportation of Jews and others to death camps.",
      "In May 1940, Nazi forces swept through France. Among those caught in the chaos was 15-year-old Genevi\u00e8ve Perrier, who fled her village in northeastern France to escape the advancing German troops like millions of others. By June, France had surrendered.",
      "Three years later, Esther Senot, 15, was arrested by French police and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In 1944, 19-year-old Ginette Kolinka was sent to the same death camp.",
      "Now close to 100 years old, the women continue to share their stories, determined to keep the memory of the war alive and pass its lessons on to future generations.",
      "\u201cWe were scared,\u201d Perrier remembered as she described fleeing on bicycle with her mother, carrying only a small travel bag, while her uncle took a horse-drawn cart on the roads of eastern France.",
      "\u201cThere were lots of people fleeing, with kids in baby carriages, everyone was running away. There was a column of civilians fleeing and a column of French soldiers fleeing,\" she said.",
      "Perrier and others hid in a field when they heard bomber planes. \u201cMom had a white hat. Some told her: \u2018remove your hat!\u2019 And that\u2019s when I saw a huge bomb pass over our heads. It didn\u2019t explode. It was the chance of a lifetime.\u201d",
      "Later taking a train, Perrier found refuge for a few months in a small town in southwestern France, in an area governed by the collaborationist Vichy regime, before her mother decided they would go back home \u2014 only to live under harsh Nazi occupation.",
      "\u201cThe Resistance was big in our area,\u201d Perrier said, adding she was willing to join the so-called French Forces of the Interior (FFI). Three women from the FFI were captured and tortured by the Nazis just a few kilometers away from her home, she recalled.",
      "\u201cMy mother kept telling me: \u2018No, I don\u2019t want you to leave. I don\u2019t have a husband any more, so if you go\u2026\u2019\" she said. \"She was right, because all three of them were killed.\u201d",
      "Still, Perrier kept her spirit of resistance in her daily life.",
      "\u201cAt church, there was a Catholic hymn,\u201d she said, singing: \u201cCatholic and French, always!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bellowed it with all our might, hoping they (the Nazi soldiers) would hear,\u201d she said.",
      "When the Allied forces landed on Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944, Perrier said she didn't have much access to news and could not believe it.",
      "Later that year, she saw the troops of General Leclerc\u2019s 2nd French Division, equipped with American tanks, coming into her village. \u201cThey liberated us and there was a tank that had stopped almost on our doorstep. So I went to see the tank, of course. And then, they held a ball not far away,\u201d she said.",
      "Towards the end of the war, French men brought a German soldier they accused of having killed a baby to the village's cemetery. \u201cThey made him dig his grave. They put him in it\u2026 They killed him,\" she said.",
      "Born in Poland from a Jewish family who emigrated to France at the end of the 1930s, Esther Senot was 15 when she was arrested in Paris by French police. She was deported in Sept. 1943 to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp by cattle train. At the ramp, the Nazis selected those they could use as forced laborers.",
      "\u201cA German with his loudspeaker said: the elderly, women, children, those who are tired can get on the trucks,\u201d she recalled. \"Out of the 1,000 people we were, 650 got on the trucks.... And 106 of us, women, were selected to go back to work in the camp to forced labor.\u201d Others were gassed to death soon after their arrival.",
      "Senot survived 17 months in Auschwitz-Birkenau and other camps and made it back to France at age 17.",
      "In spring 1945, the Lutetia hotel in Paris became a gathering place for those returning from the concentration camps. Senot described the crowd of people looking for missing family members, some bringing photos of their loved ones, while walls were covered with posters listing the names of survivors.",
      "\u201cIt was bureaucratic,\" Senot said. \u201cAt the first counter, they gave us temporary identity cards. Then they gave us a fairly basic medical examination ... And those who were lucky enough to find their family, they went to an office where they were given some money and were told: \u2018Now you\u2019ve completed the formalities... you go home.\u2019\u201d",
      "Seventeen members of Senot\u2019s family were killed by the Nazis during WWII, including her mother, her father and six siblings.",
      "In a recent commemoration in front of the hotel, Senot said she had hoped her survival would \"bear witness to the absolute crime in which we were caught.\u201d But once back in France, she felt the hardest thing was the indifference to the fate of those who had been deported.",
      "\u201cFrance had been liberated for one year and people didn\u2019t expect us to return with all the misery in the world on our shoulders,\" she said.",
      "In her former Parisian neighborhood, a small crowd watched her. \"I weighed 32 kilos (70 pounds) when I came back, my hair was shaved. One year after the Liberation, people hadn\u2019t meet any woman looking like that.\"",
      "Senot said when she started to explain what happened to her, \u201cyou could see the disbelief in their eyes.\u201d \"And suddenly they got angry. They said: 'But you have gone mad, you are talking nonsense, it couldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019 And I will always remember the face of a man who looked at me and said: \u2018You came back in such small numbers, what did you do to come back and not the others?\u2018\u201d",
      "Kolinka, who was 19 when she was deported in April 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau, is well known in France for sharing her vivid memories of the concentration camps with the younger generation in the past two decades.",
      "In June 1945, when she returned to Paris, she weighed only 26 kilos (57 pounds) and was very weak. Still, compared to some others, she felt \u201clucky\u201d to find her mother and four sisters alive in France when coming back home. Her father, a brother and a sister died in death camps.",
      "She did not speak about the war for over half a century. \u201cThose who told their story, it\u2019s true that it seemed unbelievable (at the time),\u201d she said.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "In the 2000s, Kolinka joined an association of surviving deportees and began to speak out.",
      "\u201cWhat we have to keep in mind is that everything that happened was because one man (Adolf Hitler) hated the Jews,\" she said.",
      "\u201cHatred, for me, is dangerous,\u201d she added. \u201cAs soon as we say: that one is like this, that one is like that, it already proves that we make a difference when in reality, no matter whether we are Jews, Muslims, Christians, Blacks, we are human beings.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a product of sheer frustration \u2026 because women were overlooked in this automotive scene, and I thought someone has to do something about it and to bring in more women and to drive the change,\u201d Mazouzi Sobati said as she drove her Lamborghini on the road to Fujairah.",
      "Her passion for cars goes back as far as she can remember. While kids her age were watching cartoons, she says she was watching Formula 1. And the passion for supercars has now become the driving force for something even bigger: changing people\u2019s mentalities and perception over women and supercars.",
      "Mazouzi Sobati saw how it was mainly men who were invited to car experiences and automotive events. When she set up Arabian Gazelles she says she was the only woman at these events, and even then, she went instead of her husband who was the one getting the invites, despite him not being a supercar enthusiast.",
      "She said brands wouldn\u2019t support an all-woman car club at the start",
      "\u201cWe want people to stop thinking there\u2019s always a man because they see a woman in a supercar; either a husband, a partner, a sugar daddy,\u201d she said.",
      "They have come a long way however, and Mazouzi Sobati is slowly seeing perceptions change.",
      "As part of the Arabian Gazelle rally, the women were invited by BMW to test out cars on the race tracks.",
      "\u201cWe do not need permission to drive, or to choose what kind of cars to drive. We do not need permission to have this passion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not wait for a seat at the table, if the seat is not available, we create the table and we all sit.\u201d",

      "Morocco's ports have emerged as a flashpoint in protests against the country's decision to normalize ties with Israel",
      "TANGIER, Morocco -- More than a year of protests over Morocco\u2019s decision to normalize ties with Israel has emboldened activists and widened a gap between the decisions of the government and the sentiments of the governed. The fury has spilled into the country\u2019s strategic ports.",
      "Amid shipping cranes and stacked containers, 34-year-old agricultural engineer Ismail Lghazaoui marched recently through a sea of Palestinian flags and joined protesters carrying signs that read \u201cReject the ship,\u201d in reference to a vessel transporting fighter jet components from Houston, Texas.",
      "Activists are urging Moroccan port officials to try to block ships carrying military cargo to Israel, much like Spain did last year. Protests often target Danish shipping company Maersk, which helps transport components used to make Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 as part of the U.S. Defense Department's Security Cooperative Participant Program that facilitates weapons sales to allies including Israel.",
      "A similar boycott campaign landed Lghazaoui in prison last year, but that didn't deter him from turning out again for resurgent protests last month, after his release. Lghazaoui is one of more than a dozen activists pursued by Moroccan authorities for criticizing the government\u2019s ties with Israel.",
      "During a rally in November in Casablanca where Lghazaoui spoke, plainclothes officers beat him and others to prevent them from advancing toward the U.S. Consulate, he said. He later posted about Maersk on social media and was arrested and charged with incitement. He spent four months in prison, from November to February.",
      "\u201cThey try to silence people,\u201d Lghazaoui told The Associated Press. \u201cThey were using me to dissuade people or to push people away from what they were doing.\u201d",
      "Morocco is one of four Arab states that normalized ties with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords brokered in 2020 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The deal delivered something Moroccan diplomats had chased for years: U.S. support for Morocco\u2019s claims over the disputed Western Sahara. But its cost \u2014 growing public resentment toward normalization \u2014 has ballooned throughout the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve rarely seen such a chasm between public opinion and the monarchy. What the power elites are doing goes completely against what the Moroccan people want,\u201d said Aboubakr Jamai, dean of the Madrid Center at the American College of the Mediterranean.",
      "Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of Morocco since the war began. While largely made up of families, students, Islamists, leftists and union members, the protests have also drawn more radical voices. Some have burned Israeli flags or chanted against royal adviser Andr\u00e9 Azoulay, a Jewish Moroccan.",
      "Clad in riot gear, security forces have stood by and watched as protesters denounce \u201cnormalization\u201d and Morocco\u2019s expanding trade and military ties with Israel.",
      "But authorities have shown that their tolerance for dissent only goes so far.",
      "Morocco\u2019s constitution generally allows for freedom of expression, although it is illegal to criticize the monarchy or King Mohammed VI and those who do can face prosecution. Throughout the war, activists who have implicated the monarchy on social media or protested businesses targeted by boycotts due to their operations in Israel have received prison sentences.",
      "The constraints mirror Egypt and Jordan, which like Morocco have publicly sympathized with the Palestinians, maintained ties with Israel and imprisoned activists who direct their ire toward the government.",
      "However, unlike in those countries, the arrests in Morocco have done little to quell public anger or activists\u2019 demands.",
      "In recent weeks, protesters have set their sights on a new target: the country\u2019s strategic ports and the companies using them to move military cargo. Activists and port workers recently demanded that two vessels crossing the Atlantic carrying fighter jet parts that they suspected would end up in Israel be blocked from docking in Morocco.",
      "Port protests gained momentum last month when Morocco\u2019s largest labor union backed the call to block the two ships, and dozens of religious scholars and preachers, many affiliated with the anti-monarchy Islamist movement Al Adl wal Ihsan, issued an edict with a similar message.",
      "While not officially allowed to participate in politics, Al Adl wal Ihsan has mobilized large crowds and helped lead pro-Palestinian activism throughout the Israel-Hamas war, drawing in young people who feel official parties don\u2019t speak to them. On a recent Friday, the group said Moroccans took part in 110 demonstrations across 66 cities in support of Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Both Al Adl wal Ihsan and union members marched portside in Tangier and Casablanca, where the vessels eventually docked April 20.",
      "In a statement, Maersk acknowledged that ships that passed through the two Moroccan ports carried parts used in the fighter jet. But it denied activists\u2019 claims of directly shipping weapons to conflict zones, stating that they require end-use certificates to verify the final destination of military cargo.",
      "A port official in Tangier who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter said that while cargo docked and unloaded in Morocco undergoes examination, ships docking en route to other destinations do not.",
      "The Israeli military did not respond to questions about the shipments. F-35s are typically assembled in the United States, using components sourced throughout the world, including outer wings and display systems manufactured in Israel.",
      "Morocco\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions about normalization or its port policies, though diplomats have previously argued that relations with Israel allow them to press for a two-state solution and facilitate aid delivery to Gaza.",
      "Some observers in Morocco have questioned whether the focus on Gaza has diverted attention from pressing domestic struggles. Voices from Moroccan nationalist circles on social media have instead highlighted the marginalization of the Indigenous Amazigh population and the dispute over Western Sahara, which they argue are more central to national identity and sovereignty.",
      "For others, the prolonged war has prompted clear shifts. The Islamist Justice and Development Party, which once backed normalization with Israel while in power, recently invited senior Hamas officials to its congress in Rabat. However, the officials were unable to obtain visas to enter Morocco.",
      "\u201cPalestine will remain our primary cause,\u201d said Abdelilah Benkirane, a former prime minister and general secretary of the Justice and Development Party.",

      "It was the mounting rage of citizens in Viterbo, a small town north of Rome, that ended the longest papal election in the Catholic Church\u2019s history, forging for the first time the word \u201cconclave.\u201d",
      "VITERBO, Italy -- It was the mounting rage of citizens in Viterbo, a small town north of Rome, that put an end to the longest papal election in the history of the Catholic Church, forging for the first time the word \u201cconclave.\u201d",
      "The Viterbo conclave in the 13th century was a pivotal event in papal elections, lasting almost three years \u2013 exactly 1,006 days \u2013 due to deep divisions among the cardinals over the name of the new pope.",
      "Viterbo is also considered the birthplace of modern conclaves, where cardinals are confined to a single place until they elect a new pontiff, and often need to negotiate before reaching a compromise on the final name.",
      "In November 1268, the cardinals -- summoned in Viterbo to elect the successor of the late Pope Clement IV -- were split mainly between two factions and couldn\u2019t reach a consensus before September 1271.",
      "As the cardinals continued to deliberate in Viterbo, frustration rose among locals due to the lack of progress, as political and internal struggles had cast a shadow over the election.",
      "Those divisions stemmed from the cardinals\u2019 allegiance to competing parties, mainly supporters of the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. That was further complicated by personal and family ties, making any agreement on the pope's election extremely difficult.",
      "The electing marathon led citizens ,who at the time had to pay for the cardinals\u2019 room and board expenses, to resort to drastic measures.",
      "The cardinals were first locked in Viterbo\u2019s papal palace with a key, giving birth to the term conclave, which comes from the Latin words \u201ccum\u201d (with) and \u201cclavem\u201d (key).",
      "\u201cThe cardinals left us a very important testimony, a parchment, dated June 8, 1270, where they said to be locked inside a palazzo discoperto, a palace with no roof,\u201d said Elena Cangiano, an archaeologist at Viterbo\u2019s medieval Palazzo dei Papi (Palace of the Popes).",
      "Cangiano noted that, according to Viterbo oral tradition, the cardinals ended up camping inside the unroofed palace.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s reportedly testified by some holes found on the hall\u2019s floor, which could be those left by the tents\u2019 poles,\u201d she explained.",
      "Then Viterbese also restricted the cardinals\u2019 meals to bread and water to make them hurry up. As that didn\u2019t work either, they started tearing off part of the roof of the large room that hosted the college of cardinals, exposing them to the elements.",
      "Those extreme conditions only lasted three weeks, following which the cardinals were allowed access to the other rooms of the palace, but not to leave the building. It would take another 15 months before Gregory X was chosen as the new pope.",
      "That was the longest papal election ever: To avoid the same situation ever occurring again, Gregory X promulgated a new apostolic constitution \u2014 called \u201cUbi Periculum\u201d \u2014 that imposed strict regulations on the election and allowed to isolate the cardinals.",
      "Gregory\u2019s election was also seen as a \u201ccompromise,\u201d with his name chosen to unite the divided college of cardinals and bring an end to the exhausting process.",
      "That\u2019s why the Viterbo conclave is seen by historians as setting the stage for future papal elections. The rules and practices established at the time laid the foundation for many of the procedures used currently in papal conclaves.",
      "Among the new rules, Gregorio X decreed that cardinals were restricted to \u201cone meal per day,\u201d and later, to bread, water and wine, to further encourage a quick decision. The newly elected Adrian V, however, suspended those rules a few years later.",
      "Fabrizio Cardoni, 61, born and raised in Viterbo, considers the city\u2019s primacy a matter of pride.",
      "\u201dThis is the history of our city,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we care a lot about our medieval neighborhood, we care about the pope palace that is truly wonderful and, let\u2019s say, almost unique.\u201d",
      "Cristina Giusio, a tourist visiting from northern Italy, was struck by the history of the Viterbo conclave after a tour of the papal palace. \u201cIt was something quite amazing. ... I did not know that first conclave started here, so it was a real surprise,\u201d she said.",
      "Vatican history experts stress that modern conclaves still owe to Viterbo some of their key characteristics, including shorter durations.",
      "Viterbo's legacy could again play a role again in the conclave that starts on Wednesday in Rome\u2019s Sistine Chapel to choose Pope Francis\u2019 successor.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say that the timing is now almost certainly respected, also thanks to all that happened in Viterbo,\u201d said Cangiano. \u201cIn recent times, usually, it doesn\u2019t take that long to elect the pope.\u201d",

      "When the conclave's cardinals finish casting their ballots under Michelangelo's frescoed ceilings of the Sistine Chapel, the 267th pope will have to decide whether to continue Francis\u2019 policies, tweak them, or abandon them altogether. Will he prioritize migrants, the environment and the social justice policies that Francis championed, or give precedence to other issues?",
      "Among the challenges facing the new pope:",
      "Francis did more to promote women to leadership positions in the Vatican than any pope before him, and his successor will have to decide whether to continue that legacy, accelerate it or back down and change course.",
      "The issue isn't minor. Catholic women do much of the church\u2019s work in schools and hospitals and are usually responsible for passing the faith to the next generation. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men.",
      "Some are voting with their feet.",
      "Nuns are leaving in droves, either through attrition or simply quitting, leading to questions about the future of female religious orders.",
      "The Vatican says the number of nuns globally has been hemorrhaging about 10,000 per year for over a decade, with their numbers at 599,229 at the end of 2022, the last year for which there are statistics. In 2012, there were 702,529 nuns globally.",
      "The new pope will have to address women's expectations for not only a greater say in church governance, but greater recognition.",
      "\u201cWe are the great majority of the people of God,\u201d said Maria Lia Zerbino, an Argentine named by Francis to advise the Vatican on bishop nominations, a first for a woman. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of justice. It\u2019s not an achievement of feminism, it\u2019s in the church\u2019s interest.\u201d",
      "Women\u2019s Ordination Conference, which advocates for female priests, goes further. \u201cThe exclusion of women from the conclave, and from ordained ministry, is a sin and a scandal,\u201d it said.",
      "Gervase Ndyanabo, a prominent lay leader in Uganda, said there should be more participation of the laity and women in the administration of parishes and decision-making at all levels. Progress, he said, has come \u201cat a snail\u2019s speed.\u201d",
      "An anonymous letter circulated among Vatican officials in 2022, highlighting what it called Francis\u2019 \u201cdisastrous\u201d pontificate and what a new pope must do correct the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d he had wrought. Its author was Australian Cardinal George Pell, but that fact emerged only after his death in 2023. Once a close adviser to Francis but always conservative, Pell grew increasingly disillusioned with his papacy, signing the letter with the pen name, \u201cDemos\u201d \u2014 the common people.",
      "Last year, a screed by another anonymous cardinal circulated, signed by \u201cDemos II.\u201d It resumed where Pell left off, denouncing what it called Francis' \u201cautocratic, at times seemingly vindictive style of governance; a carelessness in matters of law; an intolerance for even respectful disagreement; and \u2013 most seriously \u2013 a pattern of ambiguity in matters of faith and morals causing confusion among the faithful.\u201d",
      "It blamed polarization in the church on the confusion Francis had sown and urged the next pope to focus on \u201crecovery and reestablishment of truths that have been slowly obscured or lost among many Christians.\u201d",
      "Those letters underscored the age-old divisions between traditionalists and progressives in the Catholic Church that were exacerbated during Francis\u2019 pontificate. He emphasized inclusion and \u201csynodality,\" or listening to the faithful, and cracked down on traditionalists by restricting their celebration of the old Latin Mass. While the conservatives may not have enough votes to elect one of their own, a new pope will have to try to restore unity.",
      "The polarization is keenly felt in the United States, where anyone using social media can challenge the Vatican or even the local church\u2019s perspective, said professor Steven Millies of Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.",
      "Such forms of communications \"can have a narrative of what Catholicism is that doesn\u2019t come from any ordained minister, from any bishop, and can, night after night, the world over, suggest that the pope is wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "While many church leaders would like to think clergy sexual abuse scandals are in the past, survivors and their advocates want the new pope to address it as a top priority.",
      "Francis and Pope Benedict XVI took steps to end decades of abuse and cover-ups, changing church laws to punish abusers and their clerical superiors who hid their wrongdoing.",
      "But a culture of impunity still reigns, and church authorities have barely begun to deal with other forms of spiritual and psychological abuse that have traumatized generations of faithful. Twenty years after the sex abuse scandal first erupted in the U.S., there is still no transparency from the Vatican about the depth of the problem or how cases have been handled.",
      "The new pope must deal with not only the existing caseload but continued outrage from rank-and-file Catholics and ongoing revelations in parts of the world where the scandal hasn\u2019t yet emerged.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, groups of survivors and their advocates held news conferences in Rome to publicize the problem. They created online databases to call out cardinals who botched cases and demanded the Vatican finally adopt a zero-tolerance policy to bar any abuser from priestly ministry.",
      "Peter Isely of the U.S. group SNAP said it was \u201ccrazy and bizarre\u201d that the church doesn\u2019t apply the same rigor to abusers that it does to establishing criteria for ordination.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t be a married man and a priest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a woman and a priest. \u2026 But you can be a child molester and a priest.\u201d",
      "Francis famously said, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d when asked in 2013 about a purportedly gay monsignor at the Vatican. Francis sought to assure gay people that God loves them as they are, that \u201cbeing homosexual is not a crime,\u201d and that everyone is welcome in the church.",
      "His successor must decide whether to follow in that outreach or pull back. There's plenty of support for rolling it back. In 2024, African bishops issued a continent-wide dissent from Francis\u2019 decision allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, and bishops from around the world attending his synod on the church's future backed off language explicitly accepting LGBTQ+ people.",
      "\u201cWe want a united Catholic Church, but we must stay with the fundamentals,\u201d said Ndyanabo, the Ugandan lay leader. \u201cThe gospel should not change at all because of our own human weakness.\u201d",
      "The Rev. James Martin, who seeks to build bridges with LGBTQ+ Catholics, knows the degree of opposition but remains hopeful.",
      "\u201cThe challenge for the new pope is to continue Francis\u2019 legacy of reaching out to a group who has felt excluded from their own church,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBased on the synod, I would say that many cardinals feel that there needs to be welcome of LGBTQ+ people because they know their dioceses.

      "Veteran centrist Antonescu, 65, has campaigned on retaining Romania\u2019s pro-Western orientation, while Victor Ponta, a former prime minister between 2012 and 2015, has also pushed a MAGA-style \u201cRomania First\u201d campaign and boasts of having close ties to the Trump administration.",
      "Another hopeful, Elena Lasconi, came second in last year\u2019s first round ballot and is participating in the rerun. She has positioned herself as a staunchly pro-Western, anti-system candidate, railing against what she describes as a corrupt political class.",
      "Distrust in the authorities remains widespread, especially for those who voted for Georgescu, a sizeable electorate that Simion has sought to tap into.",
      "\u201cThe anti-establishment sentiment is not like an anarchic movement, but is against the people who destroyed this country,\u201d Simion, who came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe are not a democratic state anymore.\u201d",
      "Simion said that his hard-right nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians party is \u201cperfectly aligned with the MAGA movement,\u201d capitalizing on a growing wave of populism in Europe after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s political comeback. AUR rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election, proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom,\u201d and has since doubled its support.",
      "The election redo is a crossroads moment for Romania as it seeks to restore its democracy and retain its geopolitical alliances, which have become strained since the canceled election fiasco.",
      "The decision to annul the election and the ban on Georgescu\u2019s candidacy drew criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Russia, which publicly supported his candidacy in the rerun.",
      "The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s re-elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday was greeted by well-wishers at a Sydney caf\u00e9 and said the country had voted for unity over division.",
      "Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party won an emphatic victory in elections on Saturday. As vote counting continued, the government was on track to win at least 85 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties need a majority to form an administration.",
      "Labor held 78 seats in the previous Parliament, and gaining seats in a second term is rare in Australian politics.",
      "\u201cThe Australian people voted for unity rather than division,\u201d Albanese told reporters in the crowded caf\u00e9 in the inner-suburban Leichhardt where he and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, gathered with colleagues and supporters for coffee.",
      "\u201cWe'll be a disciplined, orderly government in our second term, just like we have been in our first,\u201d he added.",

      "\u201cI did certainly think of her last night as well. She would be very proud,\u201d Albanese said of his mother, who was a member of the Labor Party.",
      "In an election result reminiscent to Canada\u2019s recent contest, conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton lost his parliamentary seat. His alliance of parties was reduced to 37 seats.",
      "Canada's opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, lost his seat after U.S. President Donald Trump declared economic war on the U.S. neighbor. Poilievre had previously been regarded as a shoo-in to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister and shepherd his Conservative Party back into power for the first time in a decade.",
      "Senior Australian lawmakers say they feared late last year they would become the first government to be tossed out after a single three-year term since the turmoil of the Great Depression in 1931.",
      "Like the center-left Canadian government, the Australian government had linked their political opponents to Trump's administration and its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Australia was hit during the five-week election campaign with 10% tariffs on exports to the United States despite trading with its bilateral free trade partner at a deficit for decades.",
      "The opposition leader was branded \u201cDOGE-y Dutton,\u201d and Labor warned that a Dutton government would slash public sector services to pay for seven government-funded nuclear power plants.",
      "Labor said Dutton never campaigned at any of the proposed power plant sites and argued the conservatives realized that nuclear reactors were not popular. There is no nuclear power generation in Australia.",
      "Labor also accused Dutton of igniting culture wars. While Albanese stands before the Australian flag and two Indigenous flags at media announcements, Dutton had said that as prime minister, he would only stand in front of the national flag.",
      "Indigenous Australians account for 4% of the population and are the nation's most disadvantaged ethnic minority.",

      "Howard\u2019s 11-year reign ended at the next election in 2007. Like Dutton, Howard also lost his seat in Parliament as well as his government. Howard\u2019s departure coincided with the start of an extraordinary period of political instability that created a revolving door for political leaders. There have been six prime ministers since Howard, including one who served in the role twice in separate stints three years apart.",
      "Albanese said the first world leader to congratulate him on his election victory was Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape, who phoned at 7:45 a.m.",

      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- It was after their tiny plane crashed into the Bolivian jungle earlier this week that their ordeal really began.",
      "After smashing into the ground, the aircraft flipped over into a lagoon infested with anacondas and alligators, plunging the pilot and four passengers \u2014 including a 6-year-old boy \u2014 into a harrowing 36 hours spent clinging to the plane\u2019s wreckage before being rescued Friday in the northeast of this Andean nation.",
      "The doctor who treated the five survivors told The Associated Press on Saturday all were conscious and in stable condition, with only the young boy's 37-year-old aunt still hospitalized for an infected gash to her head. The rest were discharged and recovering from dehydration, minor chemical burns, infected cuts, bruises and insect bites all over their bodies.",
      "\u201cWe couldn't believe it, that they weren't attacked and left for dead,\u201d Dr. Luis Soruco, director of the hospital where the survivors were delivered in Bolivia\u2019s tropical Beni province, said by phone after sending the pilot and two of the women home with a strong course of antibiotics.",
      "The pilot, 27-year-old Pablo Andr\u00e9s Velarde, emerged Friday to tell the story that has transfixed many Bolivians \u2014 a rare piece of uplifting news for a nation badly in need of it after years of a spiraling economic and political crisis.",
      "\u201cThe mosquitoes wouldn\u2019t let us sleep,\" Velarde told reporters from his hospital cot in the provincial capital of Trinidad, where Dr. Soruco said he was in surprisingly good health and spirits. \u201cThe alligators and snakes watched us all night, but they didn't come close.\u201d",
      "Shocked that the caimans (pronounced KAY-men), a species of the alligator family native to Central and South America, didn\u2019t lunge at them, Velarde speculated it was the stench of jet fuel spilling from the wreckage that had kept the predatory reptiles at bay, although there's no scientific proof that's an effective alligator repellent.",
      "Velarde said that the five of them survived by eating ground cassava flour that one of the women had brought as a snack. They had nothing to drink \u2014 the lagoon water was filled with gasoline.",
      "The small plane had set off Wednesday from the Bolivian village of Baures, bound for the bigger town of Trinidad farther south, where Patricia Coria Guary had a medical check-up scheduled for her 6-year-old nephew at the pediatric hospital, Dr. Soruco said. Two other women, neighbors from Baures ages 32 and 54, joined them.",
      "Such flights are a common form of transportation in this remote Amazonian region carved with rivers. Heavy rains wash away unpaved roads this time of year.",
      "But just 27 minutes \u2014 almost halfway \u2014 into the flight, the plane's lone engine cut out. Velarde said he reported their imminent crash over a portable radio to a colleague.",
      "He recalled in interviews with local media that he scanned the vast emerald green canopy below him and aimed for a clearing near a lagoon.",
      "\u201cThere was no ranch or road along the route,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just swamp.\u201d",
      "Instead of skidding across the shore as planned, the plane smashed into the ground and flipped upside down \u2014 injuring everyone on board and leaving Coria Guary with an especially deep cut to her forehead \u2014 before splashing into the water.",
      "\u201cThe landing was very rough,\u201d Velarde said.",
      "As the plane flooded, the five of them managed to clamber on top of the fuselage, where they stayed for two terrifying nights surrounded by caimans and anacondas and attacked by swarms of mosquitoes and other insects.",
      "They waved shirts and sheets to no avail and screamed each time they heard the thud of propellers or revving of a boat engine. On Friday, at the sound of approaching motorboats, \u201cwe started shining our cell phone flashlights and shouting,\u201d Velarde said.",
      "A group of fishermen noticed, and helped them into their canoe. They called the authorities and delivered them to an army helicopter some hours later.",

      "Cardinal \u00c1lvaro Ramazzini is taking to his first conclave the same spirit that guided his decades-long front-line ministry among the migrants, poor and Indigenous people in Guatemala\u2019s highlands",
      "ROME -- Cardinal \u00c1lvaro Ramazzini is taking the same spirit to his first conclave that's guided his decades-long front-line ministry among the migrants, poor and Indigenous people in Guatemala\u2019s highlands \u2014 ensuring that the Gospel isn\u2019t preached \u201cin the abstract.\u201d",
      "Advocating for migrants was a priority of Pope Francis, who made Ramazzini a cardinal in 2019. Being elevated to the top hierarchy of the Catholic Church didn\u2019t faze the bishop of Huehuetenango, whose continued commitment to social justice led to many threats of violence. His native Guatemala is struggling through political turmoil and remains a hot spot of migration to the United States.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a duty of conscience for the cardinals, now that we have the responsibility to name a new pope, that we don\u2019t lose sight that we\u2019ve been coming along a path and this path needs to continue to grow and grow and grow,\u201d Ramazzini told The Associated Press on Saturday, four days before Catholic cardinals gather to elect Francis\u2019 successor. \u201cI\u2019m talking about supporting, welcoming, and protecting the rights of migrants.\u201d",
      "Ramazzini said the church has to advocate for migrants forced by dire poverty to migrate along cartel-controlled routes where they\u2019re often extorted or trafficked, both by helping them with shelters and other humanitarian aid and by lobbying for comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "\u201cBut this we haven't achieved,\u201d Ramazzini said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t achieve it with Clinton, we didn\u2019t achieve with Obama, we didn\u2019t achieve it with Biden, and far, far less will we succeed with Mr. Trump.\u201d",
      "Still, the church shouldn\u2019t abandon migrants or the \u201cpastoral line\u201d of advocating for social justice, peace and fairer economic relations between countries that started gaining prominence with the Second Vatican Council and reached new heights under Francis, Ramazzini said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a line of continuity and I am sure that this will be a task for the next pope,\u201d the cardinal said in the hilltop headquarters of the Scalabrinians, a missionary order founded by an Italian bishop in the late 19th century to serve migrants and refugees. \u201cWe need to be the voice of all these people who don\u2019t have access oftentimes to lobbies that we can reach.\"",
      "For most of the 50-plus years since his ordination, Ramazzini has been bishop in San Marcos and then Huehuetenango, mountainous regions that were particularly hard-hit during Guatemala\u2019s civil war, which ended in 1996. Today, they continue to struggle with extreme poverty and drug-trafficking, pushing hundreds of thousands of local youths to migrate to the United States.",
      "Cardinals are sworn to secrecy about the ongoing deliberations regarding the direction of the church as they prepare to enter the conclave on Wednesday. But Ramazzini said he\u2019s heartened by the \u201cglobal vision\u201d shared by the unusually large number of cardinals electors \u2014 133, all but a couple of whom are already in Rome.",
      "He added that he trusts the next pope will pick up the pending task of reforming church institutions and its financial structure that Francis began, as well as continue the \u201cgreat sign\u201d of including more women in positions of leadership.",
      "Ramazzini also highlighted that spirituality and social justice action must go hand-in-hand.",
      "\u201cThis is the true spirituality, which is fed by prayer, by reflection on the word of God, but that has to be projected toward the other,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next pope will have his own spirituality. But the important thing is that nobody forgets that you can\u2019t have real spirituality without putting the Gospel concretely into practice.\u201d",
      "And his own beliefs are keeping him from being nervous about participating for the first time in the election of the next leader of the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not worried because I know that nothing will happen that our Lord Jesus Christ won\u2019t permit,\u201d Ramazzini said. \u201cIn the end, he\u2019s the master of the church, we are his servants. \u2026 So he will help us come out of this well.\u201d",
      "That's reassuring \u2014 as is the certainty that he won\u2019t be picked, Ramazzini joked.",

      "NEW YORK -- Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cThunderbolts\" opened with $76 million in domestic ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, kicking off the summer box office with a solid No. 1 debut that fell shy of Marvel\u2019s more spectacular launches.",
      "All eyes had been on whether \u201cThunderbolts\u201d \u2014 a team-up of antihero rejects similar to \u201cAvengers\u201d \u2013 could restore the Walt Disney Co. superhero factory to the kind of box office performance the studio once enjoyed so regularly. The results \u2013 similar to the debuts of \u201cThe Eternals\u201d ($71 million) and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp\u201d ($75 million) \u2014 suggested Marvel\u2019s malaise won\u2019t be so easy to snap out of.",
      "Some had expected a bigger opening for \u201cThunderbolts\u201d because of the film's good word-of-mouth. Unlike most recent MCU entries, reviews (88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been excellent for \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d directed by Jake Schreier and starring Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Sebastian Stan. Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "That kind of response should power the movie to strong business in the coming weeks. Though bigger MCU films \u2014 including 2024\u2019s \u201cDeadpool vs. Wolverine\u201d (with a $211 million opening on the way to $1.34 billion worldwide) \u2014 have monopolized movie screens immediately, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d could gather steam more steadily. Or, it could go down as another example of Marvel struggling to rekindle its golden touch.",
      "Marvel spent about $180 million to produced the movie, which added $86.1 million in overseas sales. The film also teases the next MCU chapter, \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d due out July 25.",
      "\u201cMarvel set the bar so high for so many years that a $76 million opening may seem to some like it should have done $100 million or something like that,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThis is a great reset. They're hitting the reset with \u2018Thunderbolts.\" The great reviews and the word-of-mouth should hold it (in) good stead.\u201d",
      "The Walt Disney Co. also might not have expected such stout competition from Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners.\u201d The Warner Bros. release, which had led the box office the last two weeks, continued to hold remarkably well. In its third week, it grossed $33 million, a dip of only 28%.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown, has proven a spring sensation in theaters. It has collected $179.7 million domestically and $236.7 million globally thus far.",
      "Warner Bros. also nabbed third place with \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the smash-hit video game adaptation. In its fifth weekend, it rung up another $13.7 million to bring its North American gross to nearly $400 million. Worldwide, it has totaled $873.4 million. Warner Bros. added \u201cBlock Party Edition\u201d screenings over the weekend for a sing-along and \u201cmeme-along\u201d experience. The film has seen some rowdy screenings from TikTok-inspired moviegoers.",
      "More than three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set, the Alec Baldwin western \u201cRust\u201d arrived in theaters. Its release brought some closure to one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest tragedies. Distributor Falling Forward Films didn't report box office, but estimates suggested \u201cRust\u201d grossed approximately $25,000 in 115 theaters.",
      "Following Hutchins\u2019 death, the film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was sentenced to prison for involuntary manslaughter. First assistant director David Halls was sentenced to probation after pleading no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon. Involuntary manslaughter charges against Baldwin, a co-producer on the film, were twice dismissed, in 2023 and again in 2024.",
      "As part of a wrongful death settlement, Matt Hutchins, Hutchins' husband, was made an executive producer on the film.",
      "Also opening over the weekend was \u201cThe Surfer,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage as a man trying to surf a \u201clocals-only\u201d Australian beach. The Madman Films release collected a modest $674,560 from 884 theaters.",

      "When Warren Buffett announced at his annual shareholder meeting that he is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, he elevated a 62-year-old Canadian executive named Greg Abel who has long been one of his top lieutenants",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- When Warren Buffett announced at his annual shareholder meeting Saturday that he is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, he elevated a low-key 62-year-old Canadian executive named Greg Abel who has long been one of his top lieutenants.",
      "For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshire\u2019s BNSF railroad and its treat makers See\u2019s Candies and Dairy Queen along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years.",
      "He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world.",
      "Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffett\u2019s successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffett\u2019s shadow although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews.",
      "Berkshire's board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.",
      "Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire\u2019s eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate\u2019s massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshire\u2019s board who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffett\u2019s successor have praised Abel\u2019s brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses.",
      "Buffett once said Berkshire is \u201cso damn lucky\u201d to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffett\u2019s remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire\u2019s massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett that made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over.",
      "\u201cIs he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren,\u201d Olson said. \u201cHe is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.\"",
      "Buffett has said for years that Abel\u2019s main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire\u2019s unique decentralized culture built on independence, integrity and trust. In fact, Munger\u2019s comment that gave away Abel\u2019s future role was that \u201cGreg will keep the culture.\u201d",
      "Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he\u2019s always available when they need him though he will challenge them.",
      "\u201cWhen I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,\u201d Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. \u201cThe intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.\"",
      "Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honored him in 2018.",
      "Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather\u2019s Omaha grocery store as a kid.",
      "\u201cI think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,\u201d Abel said in 2018.",
      "Abel lives about two hours from Buffett\u2019s hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids\u2019 hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralized that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.",

      "Flights at Newark Liberty International Airport face long delays, cancellations.",
      "NEW YORK -- Passengers with flights to or from Newark Liberty International Airport encountered long delays and cancellations Saturday due to an air traffic controller shortage, a nationwide problem the Trump administration has pledged to fix.",
      "The busy airport outside New York City experienced disruptions all week. Faulting the Federal Aviation Administration's alleged failure to address \u201clong-simmering\u201d challenges related to the air-traffic control system, United Airlines cut 35 daily flights from its Newark schedule starting Saturday.",
      "United CEO Scott Kirby said the technology used to manage planes at the New Jersey airport failed more than once in recent days. The flight delays, cancellations and diversions the equipment problems caused were compounded when more than one-fifth of Newark's traffic controllers \u201cwalked off the job,\u201d he said.",
      "\"This particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, it\u2019s now clear \u2014 and the FAA tells us \u2014 that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,\" Kirby wrote in a letter to customers.",
      "Airport status reports from the FAA data said staffing issues were causing average delays of nearly two hours for some arriving flights at Newark, and average delays of 45 minutes for departures.",
      "Two days earlier, Newark Liberty International Airport pointed to both staffing issues and \u201cconstruction\u201d when warning travelers about delays.",
      "The Trump administration says it\u2019s been trying to \u201csupercharge\u201d  the air traffic controller workforce and make moves to address the nation's shortage of controllers. The U.S. transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, on Thursday announced a program to recruit new controllers and give existing ones incentives not to retire.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a workers\u2019 union, said at the time that those moves could help address staffing shortages, but it also said the system is \u201c long overdue for technology and infrastructure upgrades.\u201d",
      "Duffy said on Friday that he visited with \u201cour hard working air traffic controllers as we work to fix these equipment outages caused by outdated technology.\u201d",
      "United's decision to pare back its flight schedule in Newark come at an already uncertain time for U.S. airlines. Potential customers across the industry are reconsidering whether to fly for work or for vacation given all the unknowns about what President Donald Trump's trade war will do to the economy.",
      "Uncertainty is so high that United recently made the unusual move to offer two separate forecasts for how it could perform financially this year: one if there were a recession, and one if not.",
      "From Newark, United flies to 76 U.S. cities and 81 international destinations.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Billionaire Warren Buffett shocked an arena full of shareholders Saturday by announcing that he will retire at the end of the year, bringing the curtain down on a six-decade run leading Berkshire Hathaway that made him the most influential investor in the world.",
      "Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board on Sunday that Vice Chairman Greg Abel should replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,\u201d Buffett said.",
      "Abel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed that he would not take over until after Buffett's death. Previously the 94-year-old Buffett always said he had no plans to retire.",
      "Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question and answer period without taking any questions about it. He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning.",
      "Abel returned an hour later without Buffett to conduct the company's formal business meeting, and he responded to the news.",
      "\u201cI just want to say I couldn\u2019t be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\u201d Abel said.",
      "Many investors have said they believe Abel will do a good job running Berkshire, but it remains to be seen how good he will be at investing Berkshire's cash. Buffett endorsed him Saturday by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.",
      "\u201cI have no intention \u2014 zero \u2014 of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg\u2019s management than mine.\u201d",
      "Thousands of investors in the Omaha arena gave Buffett a prolonged standing ovation after his announcement in recognition of his 60 years leading the company.",
      "During that period Berkshire nearly doubled the returns of the S&P 500, with a 19.9% compounded annual growth rate compared with the index\u2019s 10.4% gain.",
      "Buffett had such a devoted following among investors that markets would move when his investments were disclosed because so many people copied him.",
      "CFRA research analyst Cathy Seifert said it had to be hard for Buffett to decide to step down.",
      "\u201cThis was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think there will be an effort at maintaining a \u2018business as usual\u2019 environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.\u201d",
      "In many respects, Abel has already been running much of the company for years. But he hasn't been managing Berkshire's insurance operations or deciding where to invest all of its cash. He will now take those tasks on, but Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will remain to help oversee the insurance companies.",
      "Investment manager Omar Malik of Hosking Partners in London said before Buffett\u2019s announcement that he wasn\u2019t worried about Berkshire\u2019s future under Abel.",
      "\u201cNot really (worried). He\u2019s had such a long time alongside Warren and a chance to know the businesses,\u201d Malik said about Abel. \"The question is will he allocate capital as dynamically as Warren? And the answer is no. But I think he\u2019ll do a fine job with the support of the others.\u201d",
      "Cole Smead of Smead Capital Management said he wasn't surprised Buffett is stepping down after watching him Saturday because the 94-year-old wasn't as sharp as in past years. At one point, he made a basic math mistake in one of his answers. At other points, he got off track while telling stories about Berkshire and his investing without answering the question he was asked.",
      "Abel is well regarded by Berkshire's managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years. But he will have a hard time matching Buffett's legendary performance, and since he doesn't control 30% of Berkshire's stock like Buffett does, he won't have as much leeway.",
      "\u201cI think the challenge he\u2019s going to have is if anyone is going to give him Buffett or (former Vice Chairman Charlie) Munger\u2019s pass card? Not a chance in God\u2019s name,\" Smead said. Buffett always enjoyed a devoted following among shareholders.",
      "Buffett has said that Abel might even be a more hands-on manager than he is and get more out of Berkshire\u2019s companies. Managers within the company say they have to be well prepared before talking to Abel because they know he will ask tough questions.",
      "Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, said he never thought he would see Buffett retire.",
      "\u201cI didn't think he would retire while his mind is still working so well, nor did I think it'd happen at the annual meeting,\u201d Check said. \u201cBut overall I'm very happy for him.\u201d",
      "Earlier Saturday, Buffett warned of dire global consequences from President Donald Trump's tariffs while telling the thousands of investors gathered at his annual meeting that \u201ctrade should not be a weapon\u201d but \"there's no question that trade can be an act of war.\u201d",
      "Buffett said Trump's trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don\u2019t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,\u201d Buffett said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting.",
      "While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.",
      "Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, so Berkshire is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \u201cbombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\u201d",
      "Buffett said the recent turmoil in the markets that generated headlines after Trump's tariff announcement last month \u201cis really nothing.\u201d He dismissed the recent drop as relatively small. He cited when the Dow Jones industrial average went from 240 on the day he was born in 1930 down to 41 during the Great Depression as a truly significant drop in the markets. Currently the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits at 41,317.43.",
      "\u201cThis has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,\" he said.",
      "Buffett said he hasn't bought back any of Berkshire's shares this year either because they don't seem to be a bargain either.",
      "Investor Chris Bloomstran, who is president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, told the Gabelli investment conference Friday that a financial crisis might be the best thing for Berkshire because it would create opportunities to invest at attractive prices.",
      "\u201cBerkshire needs a crisis. I mean Berkshire thrives in crisis,\u201d Bloomstran said.",
      "The meeting attracts some 40,000 people every year who want to hear from Buffett, including some celebrities and well-known investors. This year, Hillary Rodham Clinton also attended. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly because he has shied away from politics and any controversial topic in recent years for fear of hurting Berkshire\u2019s businesses.",
      "One investor even camped outside the arena overnight to be first in line.",
      "Devan Bisher, 72, said he has faith in Berkshire's future and does not plan to sell the stock he started buying in the 1980s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a good train to ride,\u201d Bisher said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to stay with it.\u201d",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs will indefinitely idle three steel plants this summer, saying Friday that it is being buffeted by sluggish demand and pricing for some products, including high carbon steel sheets.",
      "The company said the idling of two Pennsylvania plants, one in Steelton and one in Conshohocken, and one in Riverdale, Illinois, is due to \u201cinsufficient demand and pricing\u201d and nothing to do with President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "\u201cThese temporary, indefinite idles are a necessary response to insufficient demand and pricing for the products the affected facilities produce, including rail, specialty plate, and high-carbon sheet; all of which fall outside of Cliffs\u2019 core business focus,\u201d the company said.",
      "The idlings will be indefinite, and start around June 30, at the end of a 60-day notice period required by federal law. About 950 workers will be out of work during the shutdowns, Cleveland Cliffs said.",
      "It said its flat-rolled steel production levels will not be affected.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs in recent weeks had announced that it will idle or partially idle two iron ore mines in Minnesota, affecting 630 workers. It also said in March that it will idle a steel plant in Dearborn, Michigan, affecting about 600 workers, citing \u201cweak automotive production in the United States.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Tesla sales plunged by more than half last month in several European countries in a sign that Elon Musk could struggle to revive the company after he shifts from his Washington work to running the automaker again.",
      "Tesla sales collapsed in April by more than two-thirds from a year earlier in Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, according to auto groups and government agencies Friday. Sales at the Austin, Texas, company dropped by 59% in France and 38% in Norway.",

      "In Germany, where he told voters their country was lost if they didn't vote for a candidate widely derided for her extreme views, sales plunged 62% in the first three months this year. German sales for April are not out yet.",
      "Financial analysts covering Tesla are worried about the Musk backlash but caution it's not clear exactly how much to blame politics for the hit. Other factors suppressing sales include Tesla's aging model lineup and new offerings from rival electric vehicles makers, such as China BYD.",
      "Tesla also had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply. And the company is still waiting for European regulators to approve its partial self-driving features in its cars, a big selling point in the U.S. and China.",

      "Guacamole has been spared from tariffs for now",
      "Guacamole has been spared from tariffs for now. But salsa may not be so lucky.",
      "While threatened tariffs on Mexican avocados have been put on pause, the U.S. government plans to put a nearly 21% duty on fresh Mexican tomatoes starting July 14. A duty \u2014 like a tariff \u2014 is a tax on imports, and this one will impact the 4 billion pounds of tomatoes the U.S. imports from Mexico each year.",
      "Proponents say the duty will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange, a trade group.",
      "\u201cUnless we even the playing field in terms of fair pricing, you\u2019re not going to have a domestic industry for fresh tomatoes in the very near future,\u201d said Robert Guenther, the executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange. Florida and California are the top U.S. producers of tomatoes, but most of California\u2019s crop is turned into sauces and other products.",
      "Opponents say the duty will make fresh tomatoes more expensive for U.S. buyers. NatureSweet, a San Antonio-based company that grows tomatoes in Mexico as well as the U.S., said it will be paying millions of dollars each month in duties if the decision isn\u2019t reversed.",
      "\u201cWe will look for ways to adapt or streamline our operations, but the truth is, we are always doing that so we run an efficient business already,\u201d said Skip Hulett, NatureSweet\u2019s chief legal officer. \u201cProduce is not a large-margin business. We\u2019re determining what portion of the cost we could absorb, but these added costs will most certainly need to be passed on to the consumer.\u201d",
      "Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, expects U.S. retail prices for tomatoes to rise by around 10.5% if the tariffs go through.",
      "Mexico\u2019s government said last month it was convinced it could negotiate over the issue. But if the duty goes into effect, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum hinted that Mexico could take similar action against imported chicken and pork legs from the U.S.",
      "The tug-of-war over tomatoes has a long history. In 1996, shortly after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, the U.S. Department of Commerce investigated allegations that Mexico was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping.",
      "The U.S. government agreed to suspend the investigation if Mexico met certain rules, including selling its tomatoes at a minimum price. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides have always reached an agreement that avoided duties.",
      "But last month, the Commerce Department announced its withdrawal from the latest agreement, saying it has been \u201cflooded with comments\u201d from U.S. tomato growers who want better protection from Mexican imports.",
      "Guenther, of the Florida Tomato Exchange, said even though Mexican exporters are required to charge a minimum price, shipments are only spot-checked, so exporters can get around that. But more generally, Mexico hurts the U.S. industry because it costs 40% to 50% less to grow tomatoes there, Guenther said. Land is cheaper, labor is cheaper and inputs like seeds and fertilizer cost less, he said.",
      "Tomatoes are a labor-intensive crop, Guenther said, and the U.S. industry typically relies on immigrant workers through the H-2A visa program. That program required farmers to pay workers an average of $16.98 per hour last year, an amount that has jumped as labor has become harder to find. Richards estimates that workers on Mexican tomato farms earn about one-tenth that rate.",
      "NatureSweet acknowledges that it\u2019s more cost-effective to grow tomatoes in Mexico, but says climate is one of the biggest reasons. The company\u2019s Mexican greenhouses don\u2019t need lighting, heating or cooling systems because of the year-round weather conditions.",
      "\u201cYou can relocate some industries, but you can\u2019t relocate climate agriculture,\u201d Hulett said.",
      "Lance Jungmeyer, the president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes, said Florida doesn\u2019t produce the vine-ripened tomatoes that U.S. consumers increasingly favor. Florida tomatoes are picked when they\u2019re green and shipped to warehouses to ripen, he said.",
      "\u201cFlorida doesn\u2019t grow the kinds of specialty tomatoes that have taken off, but they want to get protection,\u201d Jungmeyer said. \u201cTheir market share is dropping for reasons of their own choice.\u201d",

      "Adrian Burciaga, co-owner of Don Artemio, an upscale Mexican restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, wouldn\u2019t want to switch to a U.S. producer. He compares it to fine wine; if he wants a good cabernet sauvignon, he gets it from Napa, California, but if he wants a good tomato that remind him of his childhood, he gets it from Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe know the flavors they are going to bring to the salsas and moles. We don\u2019t want to compromise flavors,\u201d Burciaga said.",
      "Burciaga said his restaurant uses 300 to 400 pounds of Roma tomatoes from Mexico every week. He currently pays $19 for a 25-pound crate of tomatoes. He doesn\u2019t relish paying the additional cost, but he feels he has no choice.",
      "Burciaga said the tomato duty and the threat of other tariffs against Mexico \u2013 which were put in place in February but then paused \u2013 are making it difficult to run his business.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty part concerns us. A small or medium restaurant budgets things out. We know in advance that in six months things will increase, so we\u2019re able to adjust,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know these things in advance. How do you plan and how do you react?\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to clear the way for Elon Musk \u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to access Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans.",
      "The emergency appeal is the first in a string of applications to the high court involving DOGE's swift-moving work across the federal government.",
      "It comes after a judge in Maryland restricted the team's access to Social Security under federal privacy laws. The agency holds personal records on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents.",
      "The government says the team needs access to target waste in the federal government. Musk, now preparing to step back from his work with DOGE, has been focused on Social Security as an alleged hotbed of fraud. The billionaire entrepreneur has described it as a \u201c Ponzi scheme \u201d and insisted that reducing waste in the program is an important way to cut government spending.",
      "Solicitor General John Sauer argued Friday that the judge\u2019s restrictions disrupt DOGE\u2019s important work and inappropriately interfere with executive-branch decisions. \u201cLeft undisturbed, this preliminary injunction will only invite further judicial incursions into internal agency decision-making,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He asked the justices to block the order from U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "An appeals court previously refused to immediately to lift the block on DOGE access, though it split along ideological lines. Conservative judges in the minority said there\u2019s no evidence that the team has done any \u201ctargeted snooping\u201d or exposed personal information.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by a group of labor unions and retirees represented by the group Democracy Forward. The Supreme Court asked them for a response to the administration's appeal by May 12.",
      "More than two dozen lawsuits have been filed over DOGE's work, which has included deep cuts at federal agencies and large-scale layoffs.",
      "Hollander found that DOGE's efforts at Social Security amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d based on \u201clittle more than suspicion\u201d of fraud.",
      "Her order does allow staffers to access data that has been made anonymous, but the Trump administration has said DOGE can't work effectively with those restrictions.",
      "Elizabeth Laird with the nonprofit group Center for Democracy and Technology said wide-ranging access to sensitive personal data poses a serious threat. \u201cIf DOGE gets a hold of this information, it opens the floodgates on a host of potential harms. It also normalizes a very dangerous practice for other federal agencies,\u201d she said.",
      "The nation's court system has been ground zero for pushback to President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping conservative agenda, with about 200 lawsuits filed challenging policies on everything from immigration to education to mass layoffs of federal workers.",
      "Among those that have reached the Supreme Court so far, the justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration but have rejected the government\u2019s broad arguments in other cases.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is planning on Friday to unveil President Donald Trump's 2026 budget, a sweeping framework that is expected to propose steep reductions, if not a wholesale zeroing out, of various federal programs as part of his administration's priorities.",
      "Budgets do not become law but serve as a touchstone for the upcoming fiscal year debates. Often considered a statement of values, this first budget since Trump's return to the White House carries the added weight of defining the Republican president's second-term pursuits, alongside his party in Congress.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025, confirmed Friday's planned release. It is expected to be the so-called \u201cskinny\u201d version of topline numbers, with more details to come.",
      "\u201cDetails soon,\u201d Vought said during a Cabinet meeting this week at the White House.",
      "The nation's estimated $7 trillion-plus federal budget has been growing steadily, with annual deficits fast approaching $2 trillion and the annual interest on the debt almost $1 trillion. That's thanks mostly to the spike in emergency COVID-19 pandemic spending, changes in the tax code and climbing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and other programs, largely to cover the nation's health needs as people age. The nation's debt load, at $36 trillion, is ballooning.",

      "\"We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Meantime, Cabinet officials are expected to start making the trek to Capitol Hill to testify about their various requests in the president's budget.",
      "It's Congress, under its constitutional powers, that decides the spending plans, approves the bills that authorize federal programs and funds them through the appropriations process. Often, that system breaks down, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap spending bills to keep the government funded and avoid federal shutdowns.",
      "Vought is also expected on Capitol Hill in the weeks ahead as the Trump administration presses its case to Congress for funds.",
      "Among the more skilled conservative budget hands in Washington, Vought has charted a career toward this moment. He served during the first Trump administration in the same role and, for Project 2025, wrote an extensive chapter about the remaking of the federal government.",
      "Vought has separately been preparing a $9 billion package that would gut current 2025 funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which involves Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Trump signed an executive order late Thursday that instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for PBS and NPR.",

      "European Union privacy watchdogs have fined TikTok 530 million euros",
      "LONDON -- European Union privacy watchdogs fined TikTok 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday after a four-year investigation found that the video sharing app's data transfers to China breached the EU's strict data privacy rules.",
      "Ireland's Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months.",
      "The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok's lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company's European headquarters is based in Dublin.",
      "\u201cTikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,\u201d Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement.",
      "TikTok said it disagreed with the decision and plans to appeal.",
      "The company said in a blog post that the decision focuses on a \u201cselect period\u201d ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building three data centers in Europe.",
      "\u201cThe facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm,\" said Christine Grahn, TikTok's European head of public policy and government relations. \u201cThe decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures.\u201d",
      "TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal information of its users amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk over user data sent to China. In 2023, the watchdog fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate child privacy investigation.",
      "The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address \u201cpotential access by Chinese authorities\u201d to European users' personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as \u2018materially diverging\u2019 from EU standards.\u201d",
      "Grahn said TikTok has \u201chas never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.\u201d",
      "Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection.",
      "The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok's privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved \u201cremote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China.\u201d",
      "TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information to throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn't store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn't until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers.",
      "Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments \u201cvery seriously\" and \u201cconsidering what further regulatory action may be warranted.\u201d",

      "But Reform appears to have momentum. National polls now suggest its support equals or surpasses that of Labour and the Conservatives, and it hopes to displace the Conservatives as the country\u2019s main party on the right before the next national election, due by 2029.",
      "The local elections held Thursday in many areas of England were a sobering rebuff to Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government, 10 months after it was elected in a landslide.",
      "Farage\u2019s party is targeting working-class voters who once backed Labour. Starmer\u2019s popularity has plunged as his government struggles to kick-start a sluggish economy. The government has raised the minimum wage, strengthened workers\u2019 rights and pumped money into the state-funded health system \u2014 but also hiked employer\u2019 taxes and cut welfare benefits.",
      "Starmer said that he understood why many voters are discontented.",
      "\u201cMy response is: We get it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.\u201d",
      "The results were an even bigger blow to the Conservatives, whose voters switched to Reform in droves.",
      "Reform, which didn't exist when these areas last voted four years ago, won hundreds of municipal seats in the elections for six mayoralties and the control of 23 local councils, mostly at the Tories' expense.",
      "Reform won control of several county-level local authorities, including previous Conservative strongolds Staffordshire and Lincolnshire in central England, Durham in the north and Farage's home county of Kent in the southeast.",
      "Reform candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative lawmaker, won the newly created mayoralty of the Greater Lincolnshire region of east-central England. Labour retained three other mayoralties and the Conservatives won one.",
      "The victories will bring pressure for Reform to deliver on transport, garbage collection, potholes and all the other unglamorous demands of everyday politics.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who could now face a party revolt, posted on X that she was \u201cdetermined to win back the trust of the public and the seats we\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "The results give only a partial snapshot of voter sentiment. Many areas, including London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, didn't hold elections. Turnout for local polls is typically much lower than in a national election.",
      "And Reform isn't the only story. The centrist Liberal Democrats made gains by winning more affluent, socially liberal voters away from the Conservatives.",
      "Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran hard-right politician who was crucial in taking Britain out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum. A charismatic campaigner, he is a divisive figure who has said that many migrants come to the U.K. from cultures \u201calien to ours.\u201d",
      "Reform blends Farage\u2019s long-standing political themes \u2014 strong borders, curbing immigration \u2014 with policies reminiscent of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. During the campaign Farage said that he plans \u201ca DOGE for every county\u201d in England, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s contentious spending-slashing agency.",
      "University of Strathclyde political scientist John Curtice said that the results showed that politics in Britain, long dominated by the two big parties, has fragmented.",
      "\u201cReform are now posing a big threat to both Conservative and Labour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "As to whether two-party dominance will continue, \u201cthe question mark on that has just got three or four times bigger,\u201d Curtice said.",

      "Wall Street extended its gains to a ninth straight day, marking its longest winning streak since 2004 and reclaiming the ground it lost since President Donald Trump escalated his trade war in early April",
      "Wall Street extended its gains to a ninth straight day, marking its longest winning streak since 2004 and reclaiming the ground it lost since President Donald Trump escalated his trade war in early April. The rally on Friday was spurred by a better-than-expected report on the job market and resurgent hope of a ratcheting down of the trade showdown with China. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.5%. Treasury yields rose in the bond market after the government reported that employers added more jobs than forecast in April.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Stocks rallied in afternoon trading on Wall Street Friday following a stronger-than-expected report on the U.S. job market.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 1.6%, putting the index on track for a ninth straight day of gains. That would mark the longest winning streak for the benchmark index in two decades.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 582 points, or 1.4%, as of 2:35 p.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq composite rose 1.8%.",
      "The gains were broad. Roughly 90% of stocks and every sector in the S&P 500 advanced. Technology stocks were among the companies doing the heaviest lifting. Microsoft rose 2.6% and Nvidia rose 3%. Apple, however, fell 4% after the iPhone maker estimated that tariffs will cost it $900 million.",
      "Banks and other financial companies also made solid gains. JPMorgan Chase rose 2.4% and Visa added 1.3%.",
      "Employers added 177,000 jobs in April. That marks a slowdown in hiring from March, but it was solidly better than economists anticipated. However, the latest job figures don\u2019t yet reflect the effects on the economy of President Donald Trump\u2019s across-the-board tariffs against America\u2019s trading partners. Many of the more severe tariffs that were supposed to go into effect in April were delayed by three months, with the notable exception of tariffs against China.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "The S&P 500 slumped 9.1% during the first week of April as Trump announced a major escalation of his trade war with more tariffs. The market has now clawed back its losses since then, helped by a string of resilient earnings reports from U.S. companies, hopes for de-escalation of trade tensions with China and expectations that the Federal Reserve will still be able to cut rates a few times this year.",
      "The job market is being closely watched for signs of stress amid trade war tensions. Strong employment has helped fuel solid consumer spending and economic growth over the last few years. Economists are now worried about the impact that taxes on imports will have on consumers and businesses, especially about how higher costs will hurt hiring and spending.",
      "The economy is already showing signs of stress. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year. It was slowed by a surge in imports as businesses tried to get ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The current round of tariffs and the on-again-off-again nature of Trump\u2019s policy has overshadowed planning for businesses and households. Companies have been cutting and withdrawing financial forecasts because of the uncertainty over how much tariffs will cost them and how much they will squeeze consumers and sap spending.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump will roll back some of his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries. China has been a key target, with tariffs of 145%. Its Commerce Ministry said Beijing is evaluating overtures from the U.S. regarding the tariffs.",
      "Investors had a relatively quiet day of earnings reports following a busy week. Exxon Mobil was up 0.6%, recovering from an early slide, after reporting its lowest first-quarter profit in years. Rival Chevron rose 1.6% after it also reported its smallest first-quarter profit in years.",
      "Falling crude oil prices have weighed on the sector. Crude oil prices in the U.S. are down about 17% for the year. They fell below $60 per barrel this week, which is a level at which many producers can no longer turn a profit.",
      "Block slumped 20.5% after reporting a sharp drop in first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The financial technology company behind Cash App cited a pullback in consumer spending on travel and other discretionary items as a key reason for the results.",
      "Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.22% late Thursday.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Nearly four months after wildfires reduced thousands of Los Angeles-area homes to rubble and ash, some residents are starting to rebuild.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, construction workers recently began placing wooden beams to frame a house on a lot where only a charred fireplace remains standing. In the seaside city of Malibu and foothills neighborhood of Altadena, many land parcels where homes once stood are being cleared of debris.",
      "Hundreds of homeowners have sought city or county approval for new home designs and other permits to eventually rebuild or repair damaged homes, though few have gotten the green light to break ground.",
      "Some 17,000 homes, businesses and other structures burned to the ground in the Jan. 7 fires. It's uncertain how much will be rebuilt.",
      "Many homeowners will not be able to afford it, even those with insurance. Some are still trying to figure out whether it\u2019s safe to return to their properties, given limited data on the degree to which toxins from the fires, including lead and asbestos, may have permeated their land. Roughly 400 land parcels are already for sale in the fire-ravaged areas.",
      "Facing overwhelming loss and the chaos that comes with sudden displacement, those looking to rebuild must navigate an often confusing and time-consuming process. In most cases, it will take years for them to rebuild.",
      "LA issued its first building permit nearly two months after the fires started. It took more than seven months before the first building permit was issued following the Woolsey Fire in 2018.",
      "\u201cPutting this in context of other disasters, the speed is actually probably faster than expected,\u201d said Sara McTarnaghan, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studied the aftermath of urban wildfires in recent years in Colorado, Hawaii and California.",
      "Kathryn Frazier, a music publicist and life coach, had lived in her four-bedroom, three-bath house in Altadena for 10 years and raised her two children there. After her home burned to the ground, she was in shock and questioned whether it made sense to come back.",
      "But after conversations with neighbors, she became determined to rebuild.",
      "\"I\u2019m not leaving,\" Frazier said. \"That\u2019s what kept coming up for everybody, and the more we all talked to each other the more we were all like \u2018hell yes.\u2019\u201d",
      "She is making progress. Frazier hired a crew to clear the property of debris and she is nearly through the first phase of permitting, which involves getting county review and approval for her new home's design. The next phase before receiving approval to begin construction includes reviews of electrical, plumbing and other aspects of the design.",
      "Frazier, 55, is rebuilding her home without major changes to its size or location in order to qualify for an expedited building permit approval process.",
      "\u201cWe are hoping to be building by June or July, latest,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that maybe by February or March of 2026 we could be back in our home.\"",
      "For now, Frazier is getting quotes on windows, skylights and other home fixtures in hopes of locking in prices before they go up as more construction projects ramp up, or in response to the Trump administration's ongoing trade war.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing things like scouring Home Depot, finding slate tiles that look modern and beautiful, but they\u2019re actually really cheap,\" she said.",
      "DeAnn Heline, a TV showrunner, knows what it\u2019s like to build her dream house from the ground up.",
      "She waited more than two years for construction to be completed on the five-bedroom, eight-bath home with ocean views. Once the project was done, her husband vowed to never build another house. The family lived there for six years before it was destroyed in the Palisades Fire.",
      "\u201cIt was ash. There was nothing,\u201d Heline said.",
      "The couple, who have two daughters, have lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years. They couldn\u2019t imagine giving up and not rebuilding.",
      "\u201cNot only are we building another house, we\u2019re building the exact same house again,\u201d Heline said, noting the new home will have some upgrades including fire-resistant materials and sprinklers for the exterior of the house.",
      "Recently, they cleared debris from the land where the house once stood, a particularly onerous task because the home featured a large basement into which much of the structure collapsed as it burned.",
      "Heline isn't sure when construction will begin, but figures it could be two or three years. She wonders, however, what the neighborhood will look like by then.",
      "\u201cWhat are you going back to? You\u2019re going back to a moonscape? Are you there and no one else is on your block, or are you going back to a construction zone for many more years?\" she said.",
      "The Eaton wildfire destroyed many of the more than 270 historic Janes Cottages in Altadena, including the three-bedroom home Tim Vordtriede shared with his wife and two young children.",
      "The family had only lived in the roughly 100-year-old house for three years.",
      "\u201cWe just loved the storybook cottage and the vibe, and of course the grander vibe of Altadena,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect.\u201d",
      "Vordtriede, 44, has decided to rebuild, but not just yet. For now, he is using his experience as a construction project manager to help others who also lost their homes.",
      "He co-founded Altadena Collective, a group providing assistance with home designs and guidance on how to navigate the complex and lengthy approval process for rebuilding permits. Of the roughly two dozen clients that the group is serving, at reduced cost, three are in the early stages of the permitting process.",
      "Even after projects reach shovel-ready status, homeowners will have to wait perhaps more than a year before they can move in, he said.",
      "\u201cMy first statement when anyone walks in the door is: We\u2019re not here to help you design your dream home,\u201d Vordtriede said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream time. This is a nightmare, and our job is to get you out of the nightmare as soon as possible.\u201d",

      "A homebuyer now needs to earn at least $114,000 a year to afford a $431,250 home -- the national median listing price in April, according to data released Thursday by Realtor.com",
      "The analysis assumes that a homebuyer will make a 20% down payment, finance the rest of the purchase with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and that the buyer\u2019s housing costs won't exceed 30% of their gross monthly income \u2014 an often-used barometer of housing affordability.",
      "Based off the latest U.S. median home listing price, homebuyers need to earn $47,000 more a year to afford a home than they would have just six years ago. Back then, the median U.S. home listing price was $314,950, and the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hovered around 4.1%. This week, the rate averaged 6.76%.",
      "The annual income required to afford a median-priced U.S. home first crossed into the six figures in May 2022 and hasn't dropped below that level since. Median household income was about $80,600 annually in 2023, according to the U.S. Census bureau.",

      "Rock-bottom mortgage rates turbocharged the housing market during the pandemic, fueling bidding wars for homes that pushed up sale prices sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars above a seller initial asking price. U.S. home prices soared more than 50% between 2019 and 2024.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Republican-controlled U.S. House voted Thursday to block California from enforcing first-in-the-nation rules phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The move comes a day after the chamber voted to halt California standards to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "\u201cThe passage of these resolutions is a victory for Americans who will not be forced into purchasing costly EVs because of California\u2019s unworkable mandates,\u201d House Republicans Brett Guthrie of Kentucky and Morgan Griffith of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cIf not repealed, the California waivers would lead to higher prices for both new and used vehicles, increase our reliance on China, and strain our electric grid.\u201d",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government's. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 announced plans to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035, as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "State regulators then formalized the rules, some other states announced plans to follow them, and the Biden administration approved the state's waiver to implement them in December, a month before President Donald Trump returned to office.",
      "This week's House votes fell largely along party lines, though some Democrats joined Republicans to advance them. That would be against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, who sides with the U.S. General Accountability Office in saying California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",
      "Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "But the California standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, wrote in a letter to Congress in March.",
      "Newsom said the effort is another signal of Republicans' ideological shift over the decades from an era in which former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan signed landmark environmental laws to one in which Trump is pushing for environmental rollbacks on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change.",
      "\u201cClean air didn\u2019t used to be political,\" Newsom said in a statement. \u201cOur vehicles program helps clean the air for all Californians, and we\u2019ll continue defending it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which passed the vehicle emission standards, said the agency \u201cwill continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.\u201d",
      "It is unclear what will happen in the Senate. The Senate Parliamentarian in April reaffirmed the GAO\u2019s findings that California\u2019s Clean Air Act waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, according to California Sen. Adam Schiff's office.",
      "\u201cWe will fight this latest attack on California\u2019s power to protect its own residents, and I will urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the severe implications of proceeding with this violation of states\u2019 rights, as well as the dangerous precedent it would set by flouting the unanimous opinion of Congress\u2019 trusted arbiters,\" the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, called the use of the Congressional Review Act a \u201cbackdoor move\u201d that \u201cshows just how recklessly Republicans behave.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- State parks would be protected from pickleball courts, golf courses and hotel development under a bill passed unanimously by the Florida House on Thursday in response to last summer's statewide outcry over plans for these kinds of projects.",
      "The bill now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis for final approval, and his office hasn't said if he'll sign it. The Republican governor distanced himself from the proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land. DeSantis leads and appoints the heads of all state agencies.",
      "The issue created a dilemma for Republican lawmakers who have traditionally defended the governor\u2019s administration, and increased scrutiny of DeSantis' record on environmental conservation.",
      "Protections for state parks are reflected \u201cloud and clear\u201d in the bill, said state Rep. John Snyder.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve put real plans in place to make sure that, for generations to come, our state parks will be preserved,\u201d said Snyder, who represents a district about an hour north of Palm Beach. He noted the parks are enjoyed by millions of residents and tourists alike.",
      "The bill doesn\u2019t ban all types of development. But any projects must be \u201cconservation-based recreational uses\u201d that support things like hiking, swimming, horseback riding, boating, studying nature and other similar activities, according to a House staff analysis.",
      "Snyder said the bill's language was strengthened by an amendment proposed in the Senate, which also added a name change for a state park in Tallahassee.",
      "The public first got wind that DeSantis' environmental agency was looking for recreational development plans in state parks when the Great Outdoors Initiative was leaked last August. Hundreds of people protested at parks and the state's environmental protection headquarters, waving signs like \u201cParks Over Profit\u201d and \u201cSave Don\u2019t Pave.\u201d",

      "The environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intensified scrutiny and bipartisan criticism of the initiative. In November, DeSantis appointed a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",

      "Eli Lilly's stock wobbled Thursday after a looming coverage hit was detailed for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound.",
      "CVS Health said the drugs Wegovy and Saxenda from rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk will become the preferred options on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.",
      "This could complicate access to a drug that many patients cannot afford to pay for on their own.",
      "The formulary is maintained by CVS Health\u2019s pharmacy benefits management business, which runs prescription drug coverage for millions of people. Employers and insurers \u2014 who pay most of the prescription bill \u2014 use the formulary to decide which drugs get coverage.",
      "They can customize their coverage plans to include Zepbound. But CVS Health spokesman David Whitrap said most employers wind up using the standard formulary because of the discounts negotiated for them.",
      "Patients taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy if the Lilly drug is excluded from their coverage, Whitrap said.",
      "CVS Health also said Thursday that it will start selling Wegovy at a discounted price of about $500 monthly at thousands of drugstores for people without coverage. Novo had announced its new lower price last month.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity due to the amount of weight people lose while taking the injections. Coverage of these drugs has been patchy due to in part to their cost and the wide swath of patients who could take them.",
      "Shortages of the drugs also have made access challenging, but those have eased recently. That allows pharmacy benefit managers to pit the products against each other to negotiate lower prices in exchange for inclusion on a formulary.",
      "Lilly may have to make some price cuts to restore formulary access, said Daniel Barasa, who follows the company for Gabelli Funds. But he said he thinks big employers will still include both treatments on their lists of covered drugs, leaving the choice on what to use up to patients and doctors.",
      "Lilly said late last year that a head-to-head study of the two drugs showed that Zepbound helped patients drop more pounds.",
      "Zepbound has emerged as one of Lilly's top sellers. Its sales jumped to $2.3 billion in the recently completed first quarter. That\u2019s up from $517 million a year ago, during the drug\u2019s first full quarter on the market.",
      "Lilly shares shed more than $90 in value, falling nearly 11% to $804.06 Thursday afternoon. Broader indexes, meanwhile, rose slightly.",

      "\u201cThe great thing about the Triple Crown is that not many horses are able to do it,\u201d Mott said, referring to American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018. \u201cI believe that he\u2019s a big, strong horse and if you\u2019re ever going to look at one and say, OK, if that\u2019s your goal and the goal of the owner, it\u2019s still in the best interest of the horse.

      "The Preakness is the shortest race at 1 3/16 mile, but its quick two-week turnaround from the 1 1/4-mile Derby often gives pause for trainers and ownership groups.

Neither will have an easy time coming up, with the Stars facing either league-best Winnipeg or red-hot St. Louis and Connor McDavid and the Oilers taking on Vegas, which has home-ice advantage.",
      "In the East, defending Stanley Cup champion Florida faces Toronto \u2014 trying to reach its first conference final since 2002 \u2014 while Alex Ovechkin and Washington play Carolina in a series that won't get the attention of Panthers-Maple Leafs but has the potential to be must-see entertainment.",

      "\u201cI think it just settles down a little bit (after) everybody is so amped up at the beginning of the playoffs,\u201d Capitals coach Spencer Carbery said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ultracompetitive, and it\u2019s going to be physical and it\u2019s playoff hockey. But I think it\u2019ll be teams that are settled in and very, very focused on what they need to do to gain the upper hand against their opponent.\u201d",
      "After dispatching cross-state rival Tampa Bay in five games, the Panthers are favorites to repeat at odds of just over 4-1 on BetMGM Sportsbook, followed by the Oilers, Hurricanes and Stars. Edmonton is favored to win the West and set up a Cup final rematch in June, but there's a lot of hockey to be played first.",
      "This one is expected to start Wednesday night, either in Texas or Manitoba, pending the result of Blues-Jets Game 7 later Sunday night. It's no surprise that the Central Division bracket produced the two longest series, given the depth of legitimate contenders.",

      "Now they're poised to get their top defenseman, Miro Heiskanen, and leading goal-scorer, Jason Robertson, back at some point in the second round after not having either against Colorado. Heiskanen has been out since having surgery on his left knee in early February, while Robertson got injured in the final game of the regular season and was immediately considered week to week.",
      "Dallas also has goaltender Jake Oettinger in mid-playoff form. He stopped 25 of 27 shots in Game 7 and believes he and his teammates may have already survived perhaps their toughest test.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time believing that there\u2019s any team that\u2019s much better than Colorado out there,\u201d Oettinger said. \u201cMaybe try to win Game 1.\u201d",
      "Beginning Tuesday night at the \u201cFortress\u201d just off the Strip, the Oilers and Golden Knights meet in the playoffs for a second time in three years. Vegas won that series on the way to capturing the Stanley Cup in the franchise's seventh season of existence.",
      "Much has changed since, including Edmonton firing Jay Woodcroft and hiring Kris Knoblauch as coach and reaching Game 7 of the final before losing to Florida last year. The Oilers still have McDavid and MVP finalist Leon Draisaitl.",
      "\u201cThey changed their head coach, and they use their depth players more,\u201d Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. \u201cThey still rely on their two big guys, obviously, but they won games with depth against LA.\u201d",
      "The Golden Knights found great success in putting centers Jack Eichel and William Karlsson on the top line with captain Mark Stone in beating Minnesota 4-2 in the first round. They'll hope for more against Edmonton.",
      "\u201cBoth teams have some pretty high-end talent,\u201d Eichel said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be a tough series.\u201d",
      "Going into their series beginning Monday night in Toronto, the Panthers and Leafs largely have the same cores as they did when they met in the second round in 2023, though neither really plays the same way. And Toronto has three players \u2014 defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, forward Steven Lorentz and goaltender Anthony Stolarz \u2014 who were with Florida for its Cup run last year.",
      "The Leafs\u2019 strength is a daunting, five-forward power play unit of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander, Matthew Knies and John Tavares. The Panthers emphasized getting stronger and deeper on the penalty kill at the trade deadline, one of many reasons why GM Bill Zito went out and got Brad Marchand and Nico Sturm.",
      "\u201cYou get the chance to play hockey in late April, May, hopefully June,\u201d Sturm said. \u201cI want to play meaningful games. And these are about as meaningful as it gets, against the best players in the world.\u201d",
      "The Capitals-Hurricanes game April 2 featured two fights, eight misconducts and a total of 142 penalty minutes. Jalen Chatfield's takedown of Connor McMichael at the end of their bout did not please Carbery and his players, and Brandon Duhaime fought Chatfield when they played nine nights later.",
      "These teams have not met in the playoffs since 2019, but playing twice in the final few weeks of the season built up plenty of animosity between division rivals who know each other well and don't particularly like each other all that much.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to dictate play and worry about our game and make sure we\u2019re really focused and dialed in, because there\u2019s not going to be a lot of time and space out there,\u201d Capitals winger Tom Wilson said. \"You\u2019re going to have two fast, big teams in the East going at it.

      "A month after breaking Wayne Gretzky\u2019s NHL career goal-scoring record, Alex Ovechkin is in the second round of the playoffs for the first time since leading the Washington Capitals to the Stanley Cup in 2018",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin is four months away from turning 40 and still was among the Washington Capitals' most consistent hitters in the first round of the NHL playoffs.",
      "Color his teammates unsurprised.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of a kind,\" Tom Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s a machine. He\u2019s built different.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin led the Capitals into the second round for the first time since captaining them to the Stanley Cup in 2018, scoring four goals and finishing with 19 hits to set up a showdown with the Carolina Hurricanes.",
      "The best-of-seven series starts Tuesday, exactly a month after Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky's career goals record, and he's expected to keep this up moving forward because he has been a physical force his entire career with a style that fits perfectly in playoff hockey.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done it ever since I\u2019ve been here, so I don\u2019t see why he won\u2019t keep doing it,\u201d said Wilson, who has played with Ovechkin since 2013. \"He\u2019s definitely our energy. He\u2019s kind of our everything on any given night. He goes out there and leads the way, and that\u2019s what a captain does. He can be a guy that goes out and gets the momentum going for us early in a game or whenever we need it.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin's first act of his 16th trip to the postseason was a hit on Montreal's Mike Matheson 20 seconds into that series opener, which he finished with his first overtime playoff goal. He laid out Jake Evans with a (penalized) open-ice check late in the second period of a Game 4 comeback victory, then scored again in the Game 5 clincher.",
      "\u201cHe was outstanding the whole series,\u201d said Spencer Carbery, who's expected to win the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year for getting Washington to the top of the Eastern Conference above preseason expectations.",
      "\u201cHe scored some big goals, I felt like, through this series. And I\u2019m proud of him because it\u2019s a long time to sit on last year and last year\u2019s playoffs and have to run that through your mind.\u201d",
      "Last year's playoffs did not go well for Ovechkin and the Capitals. They were swept by the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers, and Ovechkin did not register a point in a series for the first time in his two decades in the NHL.",
      "Ovechkin looked like a motivated competitor this time, even though he brushed off the concept of redeeming himself for not scoring in the Rangers series.",
      "\u201cI mean, you just take it game by game,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWhat happened in the past and what happened in the regular season is over.\u201d",
      "What happened in the regular season was Ovechkin taking over the spotlight in sports and beyond it by chasing Gretzky's record of 894 that was long thought to be unapproachable and becoming the league's all-time leading goal scorer by getting a flurry of six in five games.",
      "He also did it with enough time left in the regular season for Ovechkin and the Capitals to move past the record and set their sights on a second championship.",
      "\u201cFor him to break the record and then be able to reset and refocus, and now (say), \u2018OK, this is what means more to me than the record,\u2019 which is amazing in itself, to get himself to the spot where he played this playoffs comparatively to last year, it\u2019s night and day,\u201d Carbery said. \"He\u2019s a year older. He\u2019s 39 years old. And that\u2019s a credit to him. He just continues to do things that you just can\u2019t wrap your head around in this sport, in this league \u2014 and then at the most difficult time of the year, the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\u201d",
      "Linemate Dylan Strome, Washington's leading scorer in the first round with nine points, thinks Ovechkin is doing the same things he has been all season, with a little more physicality mixed in.",
      "\u201cStill getting his shots off, still has great chances to score, still finding ways to get open, and I thought he\u2019s done a really good job,\u201d said Strome, who this season assisted on 23 of Ovechkin's 44 goals to get him to 897 in his career. \"He kind of leads the way for our team in setting the tone and getting the first goal usually, so he kind of brings our team into it and we just follow behind.\u201d",
      "Wilson, Strome and John Carlson have lived that for a long time. Anthony Beauvillier has quickly since joining at the trade deadline in March found out what it's like to play alongside Ovechkin and watch up close as he drags the Capitals into the fight.",
      "\u201cHe wants to show the way, and everyone jumps on the boat with him,\" Beauvillier. \"To see him do that and score big goals and have some big hits, how can you not get fired up and follow him?\u201d",

      "The Dodgers have won the first two games of the series to improve to 5-0 against Atlanta this year. Los Angeles' three-game sweep at home early in the season left the Braves 0-7.",
      "Sasaki (1-1) allowed three runs and six hits over five innings in a game pushed back more than three hours because of rain. The 23-year-old right-hander gave up a home run to Ozzie Albies but received plenty of offensive support in his seventh big league start since arriving from Japan to much fanfare.",

      "Ohtani threw 35 pitches in the bullpen before the game as he continues his comeback from 2023 elbow surgery in his plan to become a two-way player again. Ohtani, who has appeared only at designated hitter this season, still has not faced hitters and has not thrown sliders. \u201cFrom what I hear he was ramping it up a little more with his velocity,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.",

      "Mikko Rantanen would have never believed that he would have a hat trick in a Game 7 against Colorado",
      "DALLAS -- Mikko Rantanen figures he would have left the room in disbelief had someone told him at the beginning of this season that he would score a hat track in a Game 7 against Colorado.",
      "After all, that was the organization with which he made his NHL debut just weeks before his 19th birthday. He was there for 9 1/2 years and went to the playoffs each of the past seven seasons with the Avalanche in a run that included their 2022 Stanley Cup title.",
      "But twice traded in a six-week span earlier this year, Rantanen did exactly that and more against his original team.",
      "Rantanen assisted on Wyatt Johnston's tiebreaking power-play goal in between his first career postseason hat trick \u2014 all coming in the third period of Game 7 for the Dallas Stars on Saturday night. They overcame a two-goal deficit for a 4-2 win over the Avs to wrap up the first-round Western Conference series.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s emotional for sure because everything happened so quick,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a couple of months since I was still with them, playing with them, and chasing a playoff spot and stuff. And all of a sudden, a couple of months later, playing against them in a Game 7.\u201d",
      "After a four-point second period in a loss at Colorado two nights earlier, Rantanen became only the second player in NHL history to have four points in the third period of a Game 7. He also is the only of the nine players with a Game 7 hat trick to score all his goals in the final period.",
      "\u201cWe also had the benefit of a motivated guy. You know, this was Colorado and the team that he had played for for a decade,\u201d Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know all the behind the scenes what went on there, but he was a motivated guy to make an impact in this series. And he just got better and better.\u201d",
      "Rantanen, who could have become a free agent after this season, was first traded from Colorado to Carolina on Jan. 24. He played only 13 games for the Hurricanes before they sent him to Dallas in a deadline deal March 7 that included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know revenge,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to win as a team in the playoffs. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is.\u201d",
      "In 81 career playoff games for the Avalanche, Rantanen had 101 points (34 goals, 67 assists). His last game with them was Jan. 22, but the regular season ended with him still as their third-leading scorer with 64 points (25 goals, 39 assists) in his 49 games behind Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar.",
      "Rantanen had five goals and seven assists in the seven-game series against the Avs.",
      "\u201cWhat he did in the second period the other night ... that\u2019s the thing with Mikko, is it\u2019s not about all his creating multiple chances every time he touches the puck, but big moments,\u201d Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"That\u2019s what he is, he\u2019s a pure goal scorer. He did that in the third.\u201d",
      "And sent the Avalanche home for the summer.",

      "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Canelo Alvarez beat William Scull in a unanimous points decision Sunday to become undisputed super middleweight champion again.",
      "Alvarez is a four-weight world champion and entered the fight with the WBA, WBC and WBO titles at 168 pounds.",
      "He was stripped of the IBF belt last July when he declined to make a mandatory defense against Scull. He\u2019d owned that title since November 2021 when he defeated Caleb Plant.",
      "Alvarez became an undisputed titlist in the division for the second time when the judges scored it 115-113, 116-112, 119-109. The 34-year-old Mexican champion improved to 63-2-2, with 39 knockouts, and is unbeaten in 10 fights in the super middleweight category.",
      "The fight against IBF champion Scull didn\u2019t live up to the hype. The Cuba-born Scull entered unbeaten in 23 professional fights. He constantly moved around, dodging, shuffling and frustrating Alvarez, who later said he hated fighting that style of boxer.",
      "Moments after the decision was declared, the promotion for a proposed Sept. 12 fight between Alvarez and Terence Crawford began, with both men facing each other in the ring.",
      "Alvarez was fighting outside the U.S. or Mexico for the first time and had to make plenty of adjustments, including to the time zone. The fighters walked into the ring and the anthems started around 6:20 a.m. local time (11:20 p.m. ET Saturday) for the main bout in Riyadh, timed so it was in prime time on the U.S. West Coast.",
      "The opening rounds were slow with both boxers feeling for range and the intensity gradually lifted with Scull throwing many more punches but not landing enough. Alvarez, by contrast, stayed patient and was landing body shots. In the end, Alvarez threw almost half as many punches as Scull (152-293) but landed one more (56-55), predominantly power shots to the body.",
      "\u201cIt's OK, we won. We're here with the title as the champion,\" Alvarez said, adding that neither the timing of the bout nor the quality of the contest was a problem because he'd plenty of time to prepare. \u201cI'm a champion. I\u2019m a professional, so that\u2019s all, no excuse or anything.\u201d",
      "As for the September showdown against Crawford, who will be stepping up a weight to take on Alvarez?",
      "\u201cI feel great. Crawford is one of the best out there and, you know, I like to share the ring with that kind of fighter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d",
      "Crawford was in the crowd watching in the Saudi capital.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m feeling great. I'm feeling blessed. Things happen for a reason, and there\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m here,\" he said. \u201cIn September I\u2019m showing the world what greatness look like.\u201d ___",

      "BOSTON -- Fans of the hugely popular video game series Grand Theft Auto will have to wait a little longer to play the latest version.",
      "In a post on X Friday, Rockstar Games said it delayed the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI until May 26, 2026. It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didn't provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year.",
      "\u201cWith every game we have released, the goal has been to try and exceed your expectations and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe hope you understand we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\u201d",
      "Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar\u2019s parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.",
      "Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision. He said it still expects a \u201cgroundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence,\u201d Zelnick said in a statement. \"As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.\u201d",
      "Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.",
      "On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldn't be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around.",
      "One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak.",
      "That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia.",
      "It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",

      "Two major scientific societies say they will fill the void from the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two major scientific societies on Friday said they will fill the void from the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States.",
      "The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they will work together to produce peer-reviewed research documents assessing the current and future national impacts of climate change because a science-based report required by law is suddenly in question and being reassessed by President Donald Trump's White House.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump's Republican administration told about 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment that they were no longer needed and that the report was being reevaluated. That report, coming once every four to five years, is required by a 1990 federal law and was due out around 2027. Preliminary budget documents show slashing funding or eliminating offices involved in coordinating that report, scientists and activists said.",
      "\u201cWe are filling in a gap in the scientific process,\u201d AGU President Brandon Jones said. \u201cIt's more about ensuring that science continues.\u201d",
      "Meteorological society past president Anjuli Bamzi, a retired federal atmospheric scientist who has worked on previous National Climate Assessments, said one of the most important parts of the federal report is that it projects 25 and 100 years into the future.",
      "With the assessment \u201cwe're better equipped to deal with the future,\u201d Bamzi said. \u201cWe can't be an ostrich and put our head in the sand and let it go.\u201d",
      "Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, also chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said the two organizations joining to do this report \u201cis a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available.\u201d",
      "Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and 2023, said \u201cpeople are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it\u2019s the size of the storm sewer pipes they\u2019re installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.\"",
      "They need that knowledge to figure out how to adapt to harms in the future and even the present, Hayhoe said.",
      "The national assessment, unlike global United Nations documents, highlights what\u2019s happening to weather not just in the nation but at regional and local levels.",
      "Jones said he hopes the societies' version of the assessment can be done in just one year.",
      "The last climate assessment report, released in 2023, said that climate change is \u201dharming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security.\"",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, the assessment was just as blunt, saying: \"Climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.\"",
      "But University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who led one of 2018's two national reports, said he worries about what kind of document this new administration will try to issue, if any.",
      "\u201cI think they'll put out something that will, like, it'll be be scientifically based, but it will be pretty crappy,\u201d Wuebbles told The Associated Press.",
      "Watering down or killing the national assessment will not keep the message about the importance of climate change from getting out, Wuebbles said. The scientific societies' efforts to fill the void will have some value because it will be a statement of the scientific community, and, in the end, he said, science is about data and observations.",
      "\u201cWe know this is an extremely important problem. We know it is human activities driving it. So the question is: What do you do about it?\u201d Wuebbles said.",
      "Storms and wildfires don't care if it's a red state or a blue state, Hayhoe said.",
      "\u201cClimate change affects us all,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cIt doesn't matter how we vote.\u201d",

      "A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite",
      "NEW YORK -- Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times \u2014 often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.",
      "Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.",
      "Hoping to protect himself from snake bites \u2014 and out of what he calls \u201csimple curiosity\u201d \u2014 he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.",
      "\u201cAt first, it was very scary,\" Friede said. \u201cBut the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.\u201d",
      "While no doctor or emergency medical technician \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.",
      "Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.",
      "\u201cI wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I\u2019m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it,\" he said.",
      "But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.",
      "And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.",
      "When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, \u201cOh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.\u201d",
      "In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.",
      "It's very early research \u2014 the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.",
      "\u201cDespite the promise, there is much work to do,\u201d said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.",
      "Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.",
      "Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: \u201cDon't do it,\" he said.",

      "A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly within the first two weeks of May.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph (242 kph), if it remains intact.",
      "\u201cWhile not without risk, we should not be too worried,\u201d Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\u201d",
      "The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus (nearly 500-kilogram) spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \u201cit'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\u201d",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \u201cchances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\u201d Langbroek said.",

      "She can groove to rock and electronica. But the 15-year-old California sea lion's talent shines most in bobbing to disco hits like \u201cBoogie Wonderland.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",
      "Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some primates. But then there\u2019s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the meaning of music.",
      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",
      "Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
      "What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.",
      "\u201cScientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners \u2014 like humans and parrots \u2014 could learn to find a beat,\u201d said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico\u2019s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.",
      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",
      "To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",
      "Ronan was the top diva.",
      "\u201cNo human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\u201d said Cook, adding that \"she's much better than when she was a kid,\u201d indicating lifetime learning.",
      "The new study confirms Ronan's place as one of the \u201ctop ambassadors\u201d of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers plan to train and test other sea lions. Cook suspects other sea lions can also bob to a beat \u2014 but that Ronan will still stand out as a star performer.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not how our AI should operate,\" Kaplan said on X. \"We\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\u201d",
      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

      "Today the members of Picuris Pueblo live about 170 miles west of Chaco Canyon, between Santa Fe and Taos.",

      "The genetic analysis was led by the Picuris. The researchers said this model of collaboration contrasts with a long history of archaeologists and geneticists seizing and studying artifacts and remains without the consent of Indigenous groups.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d to begin the collaboration with scientists, said co-author and Picuris Gov. Wayne Yazza. \u201cThis is life-changing data.\u201d",

      "The U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement that will give the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast critical mineral resources",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Ukraine on Wednesday signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral resources, finalizing a deal months in the making that could enable continued military aid to Kyiv amid concerns that President Donald Trump might scale back support in ongoing peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The two sides offered only barebone details about the structure of the deal, which they called the United States-Ukraine Reinvestment Fund. But it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a critical moment in the three-year war as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides. The signing comes two months after a different but similar agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump has long criticized Zelenskyy, saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to win the war and blaming him for prolonging the killing by not giving up Crimea, but in recent days has rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin as well, saying he was complicating negotiations with \u201cvery bad timing\u201d in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.",
      "Trump said Wednesday night on NewsNation that the deal, \u201cin theory,\u201d means that the U.S. will get more from Ukraine than it contributed. \u201cI wanted to be protected,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to be looking \u201cfoolish\u201d by not getting money back for the investment.",
      "For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.",
      "\u201cTruly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,\u201d said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \u201cThis is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal.",
      "\u201cTogether with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment to our country,\u201d she said in a post on X after the signing.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bessent said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House \u2014 hours after Ukrainian officials indicated a deal was nearly finalized \u2014 that there was still work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said when asked about reports that Ukraine was ready to agree to the pact. \"We\u2019re sure that they will reconsider that. And we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are.\u201d",
      "He didn't elaborate as to the late changes he said Ukraine made.",
      "The U.S. has been seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday, empowering Svyrydenko to sign it in Washington. The deal still needs to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it can take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.",
      "Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money \u2014 a complaint he repeated Wednesday during his Cabinet meeting. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.",
      "\u201cWe are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,\" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.",
      "Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.",
      "The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.",

Their return had been delayed by a day due to strong winds and low visibility. The area is prone to sandstorms this time of year.",
      "The astronauts, Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, were launched to the Tiangong space station in October, and they turned over control of the station Tuesday to the new crew that recently arrived to replace them.",

      "The Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station has made China a major player in a new era of space exploration and the use of permanent stations to conduct experiments in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns.",

      "The three Chinese astronauts have carried out experiments and improvements to the space station during their time in space. Two of the astronauts, Cai and Song, conducted a nine-hour spacewalk, the world\u2019s longest, during their mission, China's space agency said.",
      "The country\u2019s space program has grown rapidly in recent years. The space agency has landed an explorer on Mars and a rover on the far side of the moon. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has issued a new policy for terminating international students' legal status",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status.",
      "The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status canceled in recent weeks with little explanation.",
      "In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.",
      "On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be canceled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the U.S.",
      "Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status. In the past, if a student had their visa revoked, they could stay in the U.S. to finish their studies \u2014 they simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "\u201cThis just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Banias said.",
      "Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.",
      "Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated \u2014 and then reinstated \u2014 this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.",
      "In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped \u2014 information that is also in NCIC.",
      "Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: \u201cPlease terminate all in SEVIS.\u201d That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.",
      "Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.",
      "\u201cAll of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,\u201d said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated \u201can utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.\u201d",
      "When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.",
      "Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled \u201cfailure to maintain status.\u201d Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an \u201cinvestigative red flag.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Patel is lawfully present in the U.S.,\u201d Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. \u201cHe is not subject to immediate detention or removal.\u201d",
      "Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.",

      "He described the Constitution as what \"binds us all together.\"",
      "BOSTON -- Former Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday repeatedly invoked the Constitution and said it is what \u201cbinds us all together\u201d after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.",
      "Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The award recognizes Pence \u201cfor putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,\u201d the JFK Library Foundation said.",
      "\u201cTo forge a future together, we have to find common ground,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI hope in some small way my presence here tonight is a reminder that whatever differences we may have as Americans, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand. It's what binds us across time and generations. .... It's what makes us one people.\u201d",
      "His comments came hours after an interview with Trump aired in which he was asked whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Trump was noncommittal.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not a lawyer. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said when pressed in an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker. It was taped Friday at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida and aired Sunday.",
      "Pence never mentioned Trump during his 10-minute speech but made several references to the Trump administration.",
      "Referencing what he called \u201cthese divided times, in these anxious days,\u201d he acknowledged that he probably had differences with the Democrats in the room but also with his own Republican Party \u201con spending, tariffs and my belief that America is the leader of the free world and must stand with Ukraine until the Russian invasion is repelled and a just and lasting peace is secured.\"",
      "Trump pressured Pence to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president falsely claimed the vote was marred by fraud. Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority. When a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Pence was whisked away by Secret Service agents, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the rioters.",
      "\u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,\u201d Trump wrote at the time on X, formerly Twitter, as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building.",
      "Pence rejected the Secret Service\u2019s advice that he leave the Capitol, staying to continue the ceremonial election certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory once rioters were cleared.",
      "In describing his role, Pence told the audience that \u201cby God's grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America.\u201d",
      "\u201cJan. 6 was a tragic day but it became a triumph of freedom. History will record that our institutions held,\u201d he said in his speech. \u201cLeaders in both chambers, in both political parties reconvened the very same day and finished democracy's work under the Constitution.\u201d",
      "JFK\u2019s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, who along with his grandson Jack Schlossberg presented the award, said Pence\u2019s actions that day were a reminder that you cannot take democracy for granted.",
      "\u201cAt the time I thought Vice President Pence was just doing his job,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly later did I realize that his act of courage saved our government and warned us about what could happen and is happening right now.\u201d",
      "The Profile in Courage Award, named for a book Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president, honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences. Previous recipients of the award include former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford.",
      "Pence has emerged as one of the few Republicans willing to take on the Trump administration.",
      "His political action group, Advancing American Freedom, campaigned against the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation\u2019s health agencies. He\u2019s delivered speeches urging the president to stand with longtime foreign allies and posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d",

      "A federal judge on Friday issued a permanent ruling barring the Trump administration from implementing an executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, describing President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on law firms as an unconstitutional and \"unprecedented attack\" on the basic foundations of the rule of law.",
      "\"No American president has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers,'\" U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said in a scathing opinion accompanying her ruling.",
      "\"In a cringe-worthy twist on the theatrical phrase 'Let's kill all the lawyers,' EO 14230 takes the approach of 'Let's kill the lawyers I don't like,' sending the clear message: lawyers must stick to the party line, or else,\" she added.",
      "The ruling from Howell is a rapid rebuke of the government's actions in a case that is just one challenge of several against Trump's efforts to target law firms that have either represented his political opponents or employed them.",
      "Trump's executive order, which cited Perkins Coie's former representation of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, sought to strip security clearances from the firm's lawyers, virtually halting any dealings with the federal government and restricting its attorneys from accessing most federal buildings.",
      "In March, Howell issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from implementing key parts of the executive order.",
      "During a court hearing on April 23, as Howell contemplated a longer lasting block, she again voiced concerns about the constitutionality of Trump's move and sharply questioned government lawyers.",
      "On the day of that hearing, Trump took to social media to criticize the judge by name over her assignment to the case.",
      "Trump has issued similar executive orders targeting four other law firms, while at least nine law firms have entered into controversial deals with the White House, offering millions of dollars in pro bono work on causes supported by conservatives to avoid being targeted.",

    "story": [
      "\"Prices are still going up,\" one expert said.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday claimed grocery and gas prices are falling, an assertion he's made repeatedly since taking office.",
      "In a post on social media, Trump touted the price levels alongside job growth and tax revenue in a list of gains delivered by his tariff policy.",
      "\"We're only in a TRANSITION STAGE, just getting started!!!\" Trump said.",
      "The claim of a reduction in prices for those essential goods, however, is potentially misleading, economists told ABC News. Since Trump took office, price hikes for food have accelerated and gas prices have stood essentially flat, federal government data shows.",
      "To be sure, overall inflation has eased slightly during Trump's tenure. In January, the year-over-year inflation rate stood at 3%; as of March, the most recent month on record, that rate registered at 2.4%, government data showed. That figure comes in well below a peak attained in 2022.",
      "Even a relatively low level of inflation indicates an increase in price levels, however, since inflation measures the pace of change in prices, David Bieri, an economist at Virginia Tech University, told ABC News.",
      "\"Prices are still going up \u2013 they're just not going up as rapidly,\" Bieri told ABC News.",
      "On April 24, Trump told reporters at the Oval Office: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump repeated the claim on social media on Friday, saying, \"Groceries (and eggs!) down.\"",
      "Grocery prices, which make up a significant share of household budgets, are measured in government price data under the category of \"food at home,\" which sets such items apart from those purchased at restaurants or other dine-out venues.",
      "In January, food at home prices increased 1.9% compared to a year earlier. As of March, the year-over-year inflation rate for such products had accelerated to 2.4%, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed.",
      "When asked about Trump's claim that food prices are falling, Tucker Balch, a finance professor at Emory University, said: \"I'm not aware of any data that supports that.\"",
      "Egg prices -- another cost highlighted by Trump -- have climbed over the early months of Trump's term. In March, egg prices soared 60% higher than a year prior, BLS data showed.",
      "Bird flu has continued to decimate the egg supply, lifting prices, researchers at the University of Tennessee and Mississippi State University found in February.",
      "By contrast, wholesale egg prices -- the amount grocers pay to suppliers -- have dropped significantly since Trump took office, food economists previously told ABC News. It remains unclear when and to what extent that decline in wholesale egg prices will translate into relief for consumers, they said.",
      "While food prices are rising overall, costs for some food items are dropping. Staples like rice, pasta, potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes registered lower prices in March than they had a year prior, BLS data showed.",
      "\"You can always find particular food prices that are falling,\" Carola Binder, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies inflation, told ABC News. \"There are probably some people out there whose basket of prices is falling because of what they're buying.\"",
      "Trump claimed last month that gasoline prices had fallen as low as $1.98 in a couple of states. On Friday, Trump voiced a similar assertion on social media, saying, \"Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years.\"",
      "The nationwide average price of a gallon of gasoline stands at $3.18, AAA data shows. No state boasts an average price close to $1.98, the data shows.",
      "In Mississippi, the state with the lowest average price, a gallon of gas costs $2.66, AAA says.",
      "Even more, government data shows average gas prices are little changed since Trump took office.",
      "Over the week ending on Jan. 20, the national average price of a gallon of gas stood at $3.10, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA. As of the week ending on April 28, the most recent on record, the average price landed at $3.13, EIA says.",
      "\"That puts gas prices right around where they were when Trump took office,\" Binder said.",
      "By contrast, oil prices have plummeted about 25% since Trump took office. In theory, the decline in the price of oil should eventually push down the price of gasoline, since oil makes up the key input in the refined product that ends up in vehicles, Binder said.",
      "The drop in oil prices is not necessarily a positive indicator, they added. Falling oil prices often suggest expectations of an economic slowdown that would diminish energy demand.",
      "Balch, of Emory University, said the decline in oil prices resulted from expectations of a slowdown in global trade in the aftermath of Trump's tariffs.",
      "\"It's a measure of the expected use of energy in our economy,\" Balch said. \"It is because of Trump's policies but it's not an endorsement of his policies.\"",

      "A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a lopsided margin among the small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk\u2019s employees at SpaceX. With all the votes in, the tally was 212 in favor to 6 against, according to results published online by the Cameron County Elections Department.",
      "Musk celebrated in a post on his social platform, X, saying it is \u201cnow a real city!\u201d",

      "The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaire\u2019s popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump\u2019s federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.",
      "SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area.",
      "But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk\u2019s personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.",
      "Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new town\u2019s mayor and city council.",
      "All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year.",
      "The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes.",
      "SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they to want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "\u201cWe need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,\u201d Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot.",
      "The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as \u201cthe provisions of schooling and medical care\u201d for those living on the property.",
      "SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.",
      "Critics say beach closure authority should stay with the county government, which represents a broader population that uses the beach and park. Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr. has said the county has worked well with SpaceX and there is no need for change.",
      "Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn\u2019t comply with an order to evacuate the beach.",
      "The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which has organized protests against the city vote and the beach access issue, held another demonstration Saturday that attracted dozens of people.",

      "The White House on Friday released President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, which calls for $163 billion in cuts to federal spending.",
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, in a letter to Congress alongside the proposal, said the cuts to discretionary funding would lead to \"significant savings.\"",
      "\"The President is proposing base non-defense discretionary budget authority $163 billion -- 22.6 percent below -- current-year spending, while still protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure,\" Vought wrote.",
      "While budget proposals are essentially a wish-list for the administration, they serve to illustrate the president's priorities and what the White House hopes is a jumping off point for negotiations with Congress.",
      "The cuts proposed would come from the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, USAID and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others.",
      "However, Trump is proposing a 13% increase to defense spending to bring it to $1.01 trillion for the next fiscal year, Vought said.",
      "The administration's also proposing $175 billion to go toward the southern border and $134 million to strengthen trade enforcement.",
      "Trump's proposal was met with criticism from Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who pushed back on the White House account of defense spending.",
      "\"For the defense budget, OMB has requested a fifth year straight of Biden administration funding, leaving military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms,\" Wicker wrote in a statement.",
      "\"OMB is not requesting a trillion-dollar budget. It is requesting a budget of $892.6 billion, which is a cut in real terms. This budget would decrease President Trump's military options and his negotiating leverage,\" Wicker said.",
      "Several Republicans who have been unafraid to challenge President Trump also issued statements critical of his budget request.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she has \"serious objections to the proposed freeze in our defense funding given the challenges we face the proposed funding cuts to -- and in some cases elimination of -- programs like LIHEAP, TRIO, and those that support biomedical research.",
      "\"Ultimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse,\" she said.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, also took issue with the defense spending numbers in Trump's proposal.",
      "\"America cannot expect our allies to heed calls for greater annual defense spending if we are unwilling to lead by example. Fortunately, Presidential budget requests are just that: requests. Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power -- and the credibility of our commitments -- are appropriately resourced. I hope and expect that my colleagues will join me in placing America's national security first as we begin the FY26 appropriations process,\" McConnell said.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed alarm the request could severely slash programs many Americans rely on.",
      "\"President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: he wants to outright defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with his reckless tariffs,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "\"This preliminary budget proposal is exceptionally light on details we desperately need -- but this much is clear: Trump wants to eviscerate programs that matter most to working families,\" Murray said.",
      "Where Trump's 2026 budget proposal would cut funding",
      "The budget proposal takes aim at programs that the administration has attacked in the past.",
      "It would cut funding at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which a senior White House official said had \"abusive regulatory decrees\" on gun owners. Cuts would also be in store for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which the official claimed is used to \"target conservative organizations.\"",
      "The budget also calls for huge cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services, including for programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). It also has many cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",
      "The proposed budget also eliminates USAID's foreign aid, instead putting some foreign aid under the State Department's budget.",
      "There was one notable program that the administration is looking to gut: a benefit program called LIHEAP, which helps subsidize energy bills for low-income individuals across the U.S.",
      "The cutting of funds to this program also runs counter to one of President Trump's campaign promise that he will lower energy bills for Americans on Day 1. A senior White House official, when asked about the proposed cuts to LIHEAP, claimed there was abuse and fraud relating to the program.",
      "\"We don't need a benefit hammock that keeps people out of the workforce. So LIHEAP is actually a fairly critical one of our reductions for accomplishing a lot of trying to get people back to work and dealing with the excessiveness of that, of that benefit,\" the senior White House said.",

      "Experts say gender-affirming care is safe and improves youth mental health.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released what it called a \"comprehensive review\" of transgender care for children and teens on Thursday, calling for broader use of psychotherapy for young people with gender dysphoria rather than gender-affirming care.",
      "The more than 400-page document details alleged harms from medical interventions for youth, including the use of puberty blockers, and alleged risks, such as infertility.",
      "The \"review of evidence and best practices report\" is a response to a January executive order issued by President Donald Trump, saying the federal government would not \"fund, sponsor, promote, assist or support\" transition care for those under age 19.",
      "\"Our duty is to protect our nation's children -- not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement on Thursday. \"We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.\"",
      "Gender-affirming care is supported by multiple major medical organizations. It can range from allowing a child to pick their pronouns to treatments typically prescribed for older teens. Studies show treatments are generally safe and that care has a positive impact on mental health, which psychotherapy alone cannot provide, experts said.",
      "\"Requiring that somebody [go] through a prescribed course of therapy can be misused by governments to try to essentially block access to care,\" Dr. Dan Karasic, professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, told ABC News. \"There just isn't evidence that psychotherapy resolves gender dysphoria.\"",
      "Safety of puberty blockers, hormone therapies",
      "One of the most common treatments in gender-affirming care is the use of puberty blockers, which are used to delay the onset of puberty among transgender and gender-diverse youth.",
      "The report claimed its review of studies found low evidence that puberty blockers are safe or that they improved mental health among children with gender dysphoria, and \"high certainty evidence\" that they often cause infertility.",
      "The reported also stated, \"Low certainty evidence suggests that puberty blockers may compromise bone health.\"",
      "However, studies have shown that adults who used puberty blockers in the past experienced menstrual cycles, childbirth and miscarriages at similar rates to those of the general population.",
      "Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, a clinical professor in pediatrics at Stanford University in California, said puberty blockers have been used as a treatment for more than 30 years, primarily for a condition called CPP, or central precocious puberty, which is when puberty begins too early.",
      "\"These medications are immensely well-studied,\" she told ABC News. \"The long-term effects of puberty-pausing medications, when used in children, for temporary periods of time, do function as a completely reversible pause button.\"",
      "She said side effects related to sexual function or bone density are usually seen among adults, who may take the medications for prostate cancer in order to reduce testosterone, or endometriosis.",
      "The HHS report also discussed cross-sex hormones, more commonly known as hormone therapies, claiming there is \"high certainty evidence\" that hormone therapies have \"physiological effects\" and that many studies were \"not specifically designed to capture the full range of long-term outcomes.\"",
      "Although hormones can carry side effects, like any medicine, they can greatly improve the mental health of those with gender dysphoria, studies show.",
      "Ladinsky said hormone therapies are often used with older adolescents who have had sustained gender dysphoria over a long period of time.",
      "Hormone therapies \"are all used and have been used in pediatric and adolescent medicine, for a long, long, long time,\" she said. \"Any person who's ever used combination birth control pills has taken oral estrogen. So, it's not that these medicines are unique, experimental, pulled off a shelf. They're standard pharmacology in the practice of medicine.\"",
      "Controversy around surgeries",
      "The review said it found three studies on surgeries for children or adolescents with gender dysphoria \"with most considering mastectomy only.\"",
      "Gender-affirming mastectomy, known colloquially as \"top surgery,\" is a surgical procedure that removes breast tissue to create a more masculine-looking chest.",
      "The report said authors found low certainty of evidence on the effects of gender-affirming surgeries on adolescents including suicidality, depression, asexual function, quality of life and regret.",
      "Ladinsky said there are no gender-affirming genital surgeries that occur on minors and no other gender-affirming surgeries being performed on young children.",
      "\"There is a very small group of trans-masculine older teens, meaning 17-ish, 18, who -- in our evidence-based, guideline-driven standard of care -- does allow for a tiny group of these older trans-masculine teens with overwhelming and sustained gender dysphoria to have masculinizing chest surgery,\" she said.",
      "Ladinsky continued, \"That is very, very rare and that procedure can only be done with long periods of oversight around gender dysphoria with doctors, immense parental consent and professional endorsement by those caring for the young person.\"",
      "HHS advocates for psychotherapy",
      "The HHS report advocates for the use of psychotherapy as a treatment for children and adolescents with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"Psychotherapy is a noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria,\" the report stated. \"Systematic reviews of evidence have found no evidence of adverse effects of psychotherapy in this context.\"",
      "Karasic said certain kinds of psychotherapy can be used to treat symptoms of anxiety and depression among both cisgender and transgender individuals, but psychotherapy should not be considered a substitute for gender-affirming care.",
      "\"There's absolutely no evidence that psychotherapy is a substitute for those people who need medical care,\" he told ABC News. \"There's substantial evidence for the benefits of [gender-affirming] care for minors, and that's why all mainstream medical and mental health groups support this versus no evidence of psychotherapy being a substitute.\"",
      "Karasic said psychotherapy is not bad, but rather that it has its place and, very often, children and teenagers receive psychotherapy along with medical intervention.",
      "\"If people are proposing the availability of therapy for people who need it, I think everyone would agree with that,\" he said. \"But when people are saying that medical intervention should not be provided because therapy can be used instead, that's wrong. There's just no evidence to support that.\"",
      "Response from the medical community",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement on Thursday saying it is \"deeply alarmed\" by the HHS report.",
      "\"For such an analysis to carry credibility, it must consider the totality of available data and the full spectrum of clinical outcomes rather than relying on select perspectives and a narrow set of data,\" the statement read in part. \"This report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.\"",
      "AAP also released a statement with several groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Psychiatric Association, opposing an infringement on medical care.",
      "\"Our organizations have consistently opposed any legislation, regulation or executive action that interferes in the confidential relationship between a patient and their physician or undermines the provision of evidence-based standards of patient care and physician training and education,\" the statement, released on Thursday, read. \"Patients must must be able to discuss health issues with their trusted physician to determine together what care is best for them.\"",
      "More than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced throughout the 2024 legislative session, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Ladinsky said these bills are harmful and they don't resolve gender dysphoria for anyone.",
      "\"If government-sanctioned, blatant misinformation is utilized to make policy decisions that affect millions of Americans, we are opening a Pandora's box to greatly diminish the health of all people, rather than elevating it,\" she said. \"The other thing important is that we know from 25 states that have rendered illegal elements of this care, it hasn't made any children of trans identity no longer trans.\"",

      "In the photo, taken by a Reuters photographer, the names of people Waltz had been texting included Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy.",
      "White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of the app on Thursday afternoon, saying, \"Signal is an approved app that is loaded onto our government phones. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"",
      "Waltz came under fire in March after he inadvertently invited a journalist, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal group chat with other national security officials, such as Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, where they discussed a U.S. attack on terrorists in Yemen.",

    "story": [
      "The former presidential candidate spoke as she considers re-entering politics.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stayed largely out of the political limelight since leaving office, sharply criticized President Donald Trump \u2013 her opponent in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 over tariffs, government cuts, and the direction his administration is taking the country, during remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco.",
      "Her remarks, delivered at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office, came as the Trump administration celebrates its accomplishments in its first 100 days \u2013 a date Harris acknowledged.",
      "\"Now I know tonight's event happens to coincide with 100 days after the inauguration, and I'll leave it to others to give a full accounting of what's happened so far,\" Harris told the audience.",
      "\"But I will say this, instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\" she said.",
      "Harris has had few public appearances since departing the White House and has limited her political activity, but on Wednesday night, she called out Trump by name.",
      "\"We all know President Trump, his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,\" Harris said.",
      "\"But what they're overlooking, what they've overlooked, is that fear isn't the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious,\" Harris said to raucous cheers.",
      "Harris had brought up similar themes \u2013 including the \"courage is contagious\" line \u2013 during remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April.",
      "That courage, Harris added on Wednesday, extends to Americans protesting against what she called \"the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.\"",
      "\"Americans across the political spectrum who are declaring that the president's reckless tariffs hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials; devastate the retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into; and paralyze American businesses, large and small forcing them to lay off people, stop hiring, or pause investment decisions,\" she said.",
      "Trump and the White House have argued that tariffs will help Americans be better off economically in the long run and will level the playing field between the U.S. and its trading partners.",
      "Later in her remarks, speaking more broadly about the White House's actions, Harris said she would describe the current moment in America as a \"high-velocity event\" to implement an agenda she claimed was \"decades in the making\" to shrink and privatize government while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\"It's an agenda, a narrow self-serving vision of America, where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power and leave everyone to fend for themselves, all while abandoning allies and retreating from the world,\" Harris said. \"And folks, what we are experiencing right now is exactly what they envision for America.\"",
      "Americans should be ready, if the \"checks and balances\" such as Congress \"ultimately collapse,\" Harris said, to work together and raise their voices.",
      "\"I am not here tonight to offer all the answers, but I am here to say this, you are not alone, and we are all in this together -- and straight talk, things are probably going to get worse before they get better, but we are ready for it. We are not going to scatter. We are going to stand together, everyone a leader,\" Harris said.",
      "At the end of her remarks, Harris struck a populist note: \"Always remember this country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to We The People.\"",
      "The former Democratic nominee for president has had few public appearances since departing the White House, and has limited her political activity.",
      "Harris' speech came as she is set to possibly re-enter politics in the coming months. Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.",
      "Some Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.",
      "Whether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "In remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "And in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"",
      "Harris and her spouse, Doug Emhoff, have been the target of recent actions by Trump.",
      "Trump issued a memo in March that revoked the security clearances and access to classified information of his previous presidential opponents -- Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris -- as well as more than a dozen former administration officials. On Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been dismissed from the board of trustees of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as the White House confirmed it had removed board members.",

      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting pointed out that Congress controls its funding, not the president.",
      "\"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,\" Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the CPB, said in a statement Friday. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.\"",

      "Trump signed the executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to \"cease direct funding to NPR and PBS\" on his way to Florida aboard Air Force One on Thursday",
      "The order blocks federal funding to NPR and PBS to the maximum extent allowed by law, according to a fact sheet from the White House. It also prevents indirect funding to PBS and NPR by prohibiting local public radio and television stations, and any other recipients of CPB funds, from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations.",
      "The order mandates that the CPB revise its 2025 General Provisions to explicitly prohibit direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS. It directs all federal agencies to terminate any direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS and to review existing grants and contracts for compliance. Additionally, it instructs the Federal Communications Commission and relevant agencies to investigate whether NPR and PBS have engaged in unlawful discrimination.",
      "In the fact sheet, the White House claims the two news organizations \"have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "In an interview with ABC News on Friday, PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said a loss in federal funding would hit audiences in rural communities hard. Kerger said that their access to stations has been historically dependent on government funding and that content from children's programming to backup emergency alerts could be negatively impacted by cuts.",
      "\"They formed PBS as a way that we could bring the dollars together from around the country from all of our stations,\" Kerger said. \"That would help us create the kids content that people have loved for many decades and that have really raised generations of children.\"",
      "For some stations, the situation could be dire, she said.",
      "\"For a number of smaller stations, it really could be an existential challenge,\" Kerger said. \"That means the existence of those very stations.\"",
      "Kerger and the head of NPR testified at a House hearing in March about their funding.",
      "\"I hear, respect and understand your concerns regarding bias and whether public media is relevant in a commercial landscape,\" NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said at the hearing. \"It is critical for NPR's newsroom to operate with the highest journalistic standards. That means they do their jobs independently, and as CEO I have no editorial role at NPR.\"",
      "NPR and PBS are primarily funded through a combination of public and private sources. The CPB, a federal agency, provides a portion of the funding, along with private donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. The CPB oversees dozens of media organizations in addition to NPR and PBS, including everything from American Public Media to Native Public Media and Public Media in Mid-America.",

      "President Donald Trump has dispatched Vice President JD Vance all over the world in the opening months of the administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When JD Vance was running for vice president, he walked across an airport tarmac in Wisconsin one August day when his campaign travels happened to intersect those of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and approached Air Force Two. Besides wanting to take a poke at Republican Donald Trump's rival for avoiding the press, Vance said, \"I just wanted to check out my future plane.\u201d",
      "It's an aircraft he now knows well.",
      "In the opening months of Trump's term, Vice President Vance has traveled all over the globe \u2014 family in tow \u2014 to conduct top-level diplomacy for the administration, in addition to taking a number of domestic trips. His international forays have featured a mix of meetings with world leaders, sharply crafted speeches advancing U.S. policy, \u201csoft power\u201d appearances to build goodwill and family time at tourist sites along the way.",
      "Vance's trips have included a five-day trip to Europe in February, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland in March and a tour of Italy and India in April that was notable for the vice president's brief meeting with Pope Francis the day before the pontiff died.",
      "In his first big moment on the world stage in February, Vance pressed Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d message at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and spoke of maintaining U.S. dominance in the surging industry. From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark.",
      "There's been dealmaking, too.",
      "In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official.",
      "Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights.",
      "The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany.",
      "Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance\u2019s office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations.",
      "\u201cYou try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you\u2019re honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting,\u201d he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy.",
      "It\u2019s also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public\u2019s expense, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops.",
      "\u201cPart of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential,\u201d he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance.",
      "At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office.",
      "Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job.",
      "\u201cGenerations\u201d author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation.",
      "\u201cThe research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers,\u201d she said.",
      "Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany \u2014 and autographed the \u201ckegerator\u201d built by one airman \u2014 after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India.",
      "Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump\u2019s tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there.",
      "On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries.",
      "A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports.",
      "American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours.",
      "The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public.",
      "Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well.",
      "As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too.",
      "Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world.",
      "Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there.",
      "In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with my new nuclear family,\u201d the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. \"We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope,\" she said.",
      "One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism.",
      "When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world.",
      "Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of \u201cDo Running Mates Matter?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image,\" Devine said. \u201cHe's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.\u201d",

      "The University of Florida plans to hire school president Santa Ono away from the University of Michigan",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- The University of Florida plans to hire school president Santa Ono away from the University of Michigan.",
      "Ono was recommended as the search committee's only finalist to be considered by the board of trustees on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cDr. Ono\u2019s proven record of academic excellence, innovation and collaborative leadership at world-class institutions made him our unanimous choice,\u201d said Rahul Patel, chair of the school's presidential search committee.",
      "The school's board selects the president and the appointment is subject to confirmation by the Florida Board of Governors, per state law.",
      "Ono is expected to be on campus Tuesday for a series of opportunities to connect with students, faculty, and administrators.",
      "\u201cFew moments in higher education are as exciting as this one at the University of Florida,\u201d Ono said. \u201cNo other public university combines UF\u2019s momentum, its role as the flagship of one of the nation\u2019s most important states, the extraordinary support from state leaders, and a shared vision across its entire community.\"",
      "Ono is set to replace Kent Fuchs, who became the school's interim president last summer after ex-U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse stepped down. Sasse left the U.S. Senate, where he represented Nebraska, to become the university\u2019s president in 2023.",
      "Sasse announced in July he was leaving the job to focus on his family after his wife was diagnosed with epilepsy.",
      "Soon thereafter, there were reports that Sasse gave six former staffers and two former Republican officials jobs with salaries that outstripped comparable positions and spent over $1.3 million on private catering for lavish dinners, football tailgates and extravagant social functions in his first year on the job.",
      "The amount was about double the spending of his predecessor, Fuchs, who was brought back to head the university on a temporary basis.",
      "\u201cIf I could select a dream candidate for the University\u2019s next president, it would be Santa Ono,\u201d Fuchs said. \u201dHis demonstrated record of success at the best universities, his leadership style, and caring personality have allowed him to work effectively with faculty, students, alumni, staff and other stakeholders everywhere he has been.\"",
      "Nearly three years ago, the University of Michigan hired Ono after he led the University of British Columbia. He previously served as president of the University of Cincinnati and senior vice provost and deputy to the provost at Emory University in Georgia.",
      "As U.S. colleges pull back on diversity, equity and inclusion practices as they respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices, the University of Michigan was among the first schools to make major DEI rollbacks to avoid federal scrutiny. Ono had said the school will find other ways to support students, including an expansion of scholarships for low-income students.",

      "Ohio authorities say they\u2019ve solved the more than decade-old murder of a Cleveland Clinic nurse and announced murder charges against her former divorce attorney who already served jail time for lying to police",
      "CLEVELAND -- Ohio authorities said they\u2019ve solved the more than decade-old fatal stabbing of a Cleveland Clinic nurse, announcing recent murder charges against her former divorce attorney who already served jail time for lying to police during the investigation.",
      "Friday's arrest of 51-year-old Gregory J. Moore marks the latest twist in a cold case that has eluded Ohio authorities since 2013. Aliza Sherman was stabbed more than 10 times, her body found on a downtown Cleveland sidewalk near where she was set to meet Moore to discuss her divorce.",
      "Moore was indicted on charges for murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping and conspiracy, according to documents unsealed Friday. He was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Texas, where he remained in custody Sunday, according to online records.",
      "\u201cThe Sherman family has waited over a decade for answers regarding their mother\u2019s homicide,\u201d said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O\u2019Malley in a statement Friday. \u201cThrough the tenacious work of multiple law enforcement agencies, evidence was accumulated that paints the unmistakable picture that Gregory Moore orchestrated and participated in the brutal murder of Aliza Sherman.\u201d",
      "Moore was not a stranger to authorities.",
      "In 2017, he pleaded guilty to falsification for statements he made to police about his whereabouts during Sherman\u2019s killing. He also admitted to calling in bomb threats in 2012 as a way to delay trials. His law license was suspended in 2017 and he resigned it the following year. He served six months in jail.",
      "At the time, he said that he regretted his past actions.",
      "According to Friday's indictment, Moore allegedly planned to kidnap Sherman as a delay tactic for her upcoming divorce trial. The unsealed documents include messages between Moore and Sherman showing how he called her to the office, which was locked. She arrived and waited over an hour before deciding to return to her car, according to the indictment.",
      "\u201cDuring this timeframe, an individual who was either Moore or an unknown co-conspirator approached Sherman \u2026 circled behind her, chased her \u2026 and then stabbed her over 10 times,\u201d the indictment reads.",
      "Moore swiped into the office later that evening and messaged Sherman to mislead investigators, according to the indictment.",
      "Moore did not respond to an email message Sunday. Court records did not list an attorney. A defense attorney who previously represented Moore did not respond to a phone message Sunday.",
      "Moore was expected to be arraigned at a later date, according to prosecutors who said teamwork with the FBI led to the arrest. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation took over the cold case in 2021.",
      "Sherman, 53, was a mother of four and has been remembered as a beloved fertility nurse. Rallies and vigils to honor her memory have been held on the anniversary of her death.",
      "Her daughter, Jennifer Sherman, thanked authorities \u201cfor their unwavering dedication in seeking justice for Aliza,\u201d according to a Sunday statement issued through her attorney, Adam Fried. \u201cThis is an exceptionally difficult time for the family, and we kindly request privacy during this period.\u201d",
      "Harry Czinn, Aliza Sherman's brother, didn\u2019t immediately return a message Sunday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in shock because after 12 years, you don\u2019t expect it,\u201d Czinn, told Cleveland Jewish News . \u201cThe best word to sum up my feelings at this point would be bittersweet \u2014 glad they got the person, but the memories are painful.\u201d",

      "Democrats are looking for the right message and messengers to lead the opposition to President Donald Trump in his second term",
      "ATLANTA -- The billionaire heir and the former bartender.",
      "Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Donald Trump and his second administration. But two disparate figures, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party.",
      "The governor, a 60-year-old heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the congresswoman, the 35-year-old with working-class roots, both won their first elections in 2018. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists.",
      "But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? And beyond the message itself, what qualities should the best messenger have?",
      "What links them, said one prominent Democrat, is \u201cassertiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,\u201d said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez \u201care both effective national figures \u2013- but in very different ways.\u201d",
      "Pritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics. Like Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues.",
      "He chaired Illinois\u2019 Human Rights Commission before running for governor. In office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions. His family\u2019s hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events.",
      "When Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state.",
      "\u201cTake it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,\u201d Pritzker said in Chicago.",
      "Since Harris\u2019 defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. One of the nation\u2019s highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich.",
      "\u201cIf you think I\u2019m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,\u201d the governor said his joint budget and State of the State address on Feb. 19. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.\u201d",
      "Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside \u201cdecades of stale decorum\u201d and urged voters into the streets.",
      "\u201cNever before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,\u201d he said. Democrats, he added, \u201cmust castigate (Republicans) on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.\u201d",
      "It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Pritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it \u201cterrible hypocrisy\u201d for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump's pardons of the rioters.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive who earned degrees in international relations and economics and worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics. With support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary.",
      "Like Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers. Also like Trump, she is an economic populist. But she comes from the left wing of U.S. politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump\u2019s right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites.",
      "She has recently headlined \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s next political move seems less certain than Pritzker\u2019s. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders' movement.",
      "She freely criticizes Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she\u2019s made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades.",
      "\u201cFor years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,\u201d she said in Folsom, California. She advocated for \u201cliving wages \u2026 stable housing \u2026 guaranteed health care,\u201d and blasted \u201cthe agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare.\u201d",
      "She also played up her roots: \u201cFrom the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.\u201d",
      "Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker are allied against a common opponent, Trump, and not each other. Advisers to Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker did not respond to questions.",
      "Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a \u201ctraitor to his class\u201d in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. An East Coast patrician, Roosevelt authored the New Deal\u2019s federal expansion to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s.",
      "\u201cHow powerful would it be if a billionaire was the one helping to lead the charge against corrupt billionaires and corrupt billionaire corporations that are trying to crack the Constitution and loot the American people?\u201d Green said, adding that \u201ccontinued silence\u201d on \u201cbillionaire issues\u201d should disqualify Pritzker. \u201cWe have to be speaking to the shake-up-the-system vibe that people want to see.\u201d",
      "Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a \u201cmore stable\u201d version of Trump\u2019s argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump\u2019s biggest liability, Bennett said, is \u201cchaos\u201d that negatively affects people\u2019s lives.",
      "\u201cPeople are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he\u2019s rich,\u201d Bennett said of the Tesla CEO who is leading Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. \u201cThey\u2019re mad at him because he\u2019s vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.\u201d",
      "A relative of the governor, Rachel Pritzker, chairs Third Way\u2019s board of trustees.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word \u201coligarchy\u201d didn't resonate with working-class voters. It was an implicit rebuke of the Ocasio-Cortez-Sanders\u2019 tour.",
      "Shortly after Slotkin's comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: \u201cPlenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.\u201d",
      "Bennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters' frustration \u201cover their needs not being met.\u201d It's a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the U.S.",
      "Whatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice.",
      "\u201cShe's very good at what she does. She\u2019s formidable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- It's what one historian calls an \u201celaborate, clunky machine,\u201d one that's been fundamental to American democracy for more than two centuries.",
      "The principle of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d is rooted in the Constitution's design of a national government with three distinct, coequal branches.",
      "President Donald Trump in his first 100 days tested that system like rarely before, signing dozens of executive orders, closing or sharply reducing government agencies funded by Congress, and denigrating judges who have issued dozens of rulings against him.",
      "\u201cThe framers were acutely aware of competing interests, and they had great distrust of concentrated authority,\u201d said Dartmouth College professor John Carey, an expert on American democracy. \u201cThat\u2019s where the idea came from.\u201d",

His successor, Thomas Jefferson, and Secretary of State James Madison ignored them. William Marbury, an Adams justice of the peace appointee, asked the Supreme Court to compel Jefferson and Madison to honor Adams\u2019 decisions.",
      "Chief Justice John Marshall concluded in 1803 that the commissions became legitimate with Adams' signature and, thus, Madison acted illegally by shelving them. Marshall, however, stopped short of ordering anything. Marbury had sued under a 1789 law that made the Supreme Court the trial court in the dispute. Marshall's opinion voided that law because it gave justices \u2013 who almost exclusively hear appeals \u2013 more power than the Constitution afforded them.",
      "The split decision asserted the court\u2019s role in interpreting congressional acts -\u2013 and striking them down \u2013- while also adjudicating executive branch actions.",
      "Congress and President George Washington chartered the First Bank of the United States in 1791. Federalists, led by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, favored a strong central government and wanted a national bank that could lend the government money. Anti-Federalists, led by Jefferson and Madison, wanted less centralized power and argued Congress had no authority to charter a bank. But they did not ask the courts to step in.",
      "Andrew Jackson, the first populist president, loathed the bank, believing it to be a sop to the rich. Congress voted in 1832 to extend the charter, with provisions to mollify Jackson. The president vetoed the measure anyway, and Congress failed to muster the two-thirds majorities required by the Constitution to override him. In 1836, the Philadelphia-based bank became a private state bank.",
      "During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus \u2014 a legal process that allows individuals to challenge their detention. That allowed federal authorities to arrest and hold people without granting due process. Lincoln said his maneuver might not be \u201cstrictly legal\u201d but was a \u201cpublic necessity\u201d to protect the Union. The Supreme Court\u2019s Roger Taney, sitting as a circuit judge, declared the suspension illegal but noted he did not have the power to enforce the opinion.",
      "Congress ultimately sided with Lincoln through retroactive statutes. And the Supreme Court, in a separate 1862 case challenging other Lincoln actions, endorsed the president\u2019s argument that the office comes with inherent wartime powers not expressly allowed via the Constitution or congressional act.",
      "After the Civil War and Lincoln\u2019s assassination, \u201cRadical Republicans\u201d in Congress wanted penalties on states that had seceded and on the Confederacy's leaders and combatants. They also advocated Reconstruction programs that enfranchised and elevated formerly enslaved people (the men, at least). Johnson, a Tennessean, was more lenient on Confederates and harsher to formerly enslaved people. Congress, with appropriations power, established the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau to assist newly freed Black Americans. Johnson, with pardon power, repatriated former Confederates. He also limited Freedmen\u2019s Bureau authority to seize Confederates\u2019 assets.",
      "For a century, nearly all federal jobs were executive branch political appointments: revolving doors after every presidential transition. In 1883, Congress stepped in with the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. Changes started with some posts being filled through examinations rather than political favor. Congress added to the law over generations, developing the civil service system that Trump is now seeking to dismantle by reclassifying tens of thousands of government employees. His aim is to turn civil servants into political appointees or other at-will workers who are more easily dismissed from their jobs.",
      "After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles called for an international body to bring countries together to discuss global affairs and prevent war. President Woodrow Wilson advocated for the League of Nations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Republican Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, brought the treaty to the Senate in 1919 with amendments to limit the League of Nation\u2019s influence. Wilson opposed the caveats, and the Senate fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to ratify the treaty and join the League. After World War II, the U.S. took a lead role, with Senate support, in establishing the United Nations and the NATO alliance.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt met the Great Depression with large federal programs and aggressive regulatory actions, much of it approved by Democratic majorities in Congress. A conservative Supreme Court struck down some of the New Deal legislation as beyond the scope of congressional power. Roosevelt answered by proposing to expand the nine-seat court and pressuring aging justices to retire. The president's critics dubbed it \u201ca court-packing scheme.\u201d He disputed the charge. But not even the Democratic Congress seriously entertained his idea.",
      "Roosevelt ignored the unwritten rule, established by Washington, that a president serves no more than two terms. He won third and fourth terms during World War II, rankling even some of his allies. Soon after his death, a bipartisan coalition pushed the 22nd Amendment that limits presidents to being elected twice. Trump has talked about seeking a third term despite this constitutional prohibition.",
      "The Washington Post and other media exposed ties between President Richard Nixon's associates and a break-in at Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate Hotel during the 1972 campaign. By summer 1974, the story ballooned into congressional hearings, court fights and plans for impeachment proceedings. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Nixon in his assertion that executive privilege allowed him not to turn over potential evidence of his and top aides' roles in the cover-up \u2014 including recordings of private Oval Office conversations. Nixon resigned after a delegation of his fellow Republicans told him that Congress was poised to remove him from office.",
      "Presidents from John F. Kennedy through Nixon ratcheted up U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia during the Cold War. But Congress never declared war in Vietnam. A 1973 deal, under Nixon, ended official American military involvement. But complete U.S. withdrawal didn't occur until more than two years later \u2013 a period during which Congress reduced funding for South Vietnam's democratic government. Congress did not cut off all money for Saigon, as some conservatives later claimed. But lawmakers refused to rubber-stamp larger administration requests, asserting a congressional check on the president's military and foreign policy agenda.",
      "A Democratic-controlled Congress overhauled the nation\u2019s health insurance system in 2010. The Affordable Care Act, in part, tried to require states to expand the Medicaid program that covers millions of children, disabled people and some low-income adults. But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that Congress and President Barack Obama could not compel states to expand the program by threatening to withhold other federal money already obligated to the states under previous federal law. The court on multiple occasions has upheld other portions of the law. Republicans, even when they have controlled the White House and Capitol Hill, have been unable to repeal the act.",

      "BOSTON -- Former Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday will receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election.",
      "The award recognizes Pence \u201cfor putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,\u201d the JFK Library Foundation said, when it made the announcement last month. Pence will receive the award at the JFK Library in Boston.",
      "Trump pressured Pence to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president falsely claimed the vote was marred by fraud. Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority. When a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Pence was whisked away by Secret Service agents, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the rioters.",
      "\u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,\u201d Trump wrote at the time on X, formerly Twitter, as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building.",
      "Pence rejected the Secret Service\u2019s advice that he leave the Capitol, staying to continue the ceremonial election certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory once rioters were cleared.",
      "The Profile in Courage Award, named for a book Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president, honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences. Previous recipients of the award include former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford.",
      "\u201cPolitical courage is not outdated in the United States. At every level of government, leaders are putting country first, and not backing down,\u201d Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg, JFK\u2019s daughter and grandson, both of whom will present Pence with the award, said in a statement. \"His decision is an example of President Kennedy\u2019s belief that an act of political courage can change the course of history.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "International students in the U.S. are reconsidering their travel plans this summer after a wave of student status terminations and visa revocations",
      "On summer break from a Ph.D. program, an international student at University of California, San Diego, was planning a trip with a few friends to Hawaii. But after seeing international students across the United States stripped of their legal status, the student decided against it.",
      "Any travel, even inside the U.S., just didn't seem worth the risk.",
      "\u201cI probably am going to skip that to ... have as few interactions with governments as possible,\" said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted.",
      "International students weighing travel to see family, take a vacation or conduct research are thinking twice because of the Trump administration's crackdown, which has added to a sense of vulnerability.",
      "Even before students suddenly began losing permission to study in the U.S., some colleges were encouraging international students and faculty to postpone travel, citing government efforts to deport students involved in pro-Palestinian activism. As the scale of the status terminations emerged in recent weeks, more schools have cautioned against non-essential travel abroad for international students.",
      "University of California, Berkeley, for one, issued an advisory last week saying upcoming international travel was risky due to \u201cstrict vetting and enforcement.\u201d",
      "At least 1,220 students at 187 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records.",
      "The number of affected students appears far higher, though. At least 4,736 international students\u2019 visa records were terminated in a government database that maintains their legal status, according to an April 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement response to inquiries from Congress.",
      "Suddenly at risk for deportation, some students went into hiding while others left the country on their own. Many of the students said they had only minor infractions on their records or didn't know why their records were removed.",
      "After federal judges raised due process concerns in several students' cases, the U.S. government reversed the terminations but then issued new guidance expanding the reasons international students can lose their legal status in the future.",
      "Under the new policy, valid reasons for status termination include the revocation of the visas students used to enter the U.S. In the past, if a student\u2019s visa was revoked, they generally could stay in the U.S. to finish school. They simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "The fast-evolving situation has left colleges struggling to advise students.",
      "A Michigan college employee who helps international students navigate the visa process said they are inquiring more than ever about summer travel. The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said he often has been unable to give sufficient answers.",
      "Last year, the U.S. hosted around 1.1 million international students, a source of essential tuition revenue at many schools. Advocates say that number is likely to shrink as the crackdown hurts America's appeal.",
      "Over the past few weeks, Rishi Oza's immigration law firm in North Carolina has received calls about travel risks almost daily from people of varied immigration status, including international students.",
      "\u201cYou kind of shake your head and say, \u2018Is this the character of the country we want?'\u201d Oza said. \u201cIt just seems that it\u2019s a bit out of whack that people are fearful of leaving and whether they'll be able to come back.\u201d",
      "Students in the U.S. with a visa need to decide if their travels are critical, Oza said.",
      "When attempting reentry after leaving the country, they should bring immigration documents, school transcripts and even court documents if they were charged with a crime and the court dismissed the case. Ultimately, lawyers can't foretell what will happen at the airport, he said.",
      "The unpredictability has put one international student at the University of Illinois in distress. The student, who requested anonymity to avoid being targeted, has laid low since one of his classmates left the country after their legal status was terminated.",
      "The student's plan to travel to his home country in Asia this summer causes feelings of panic, but he has nowhere else to stay. He bought his plane ticket and is committed to the trip. His anxiety over what could happen when he returns, however, is still there.",

      "JOSEPH CITY, Ariz. -- Brantley Baird never misses a chance to talk history, from how his great-grandmother helped settle the town of Snowflake long before Arizona was granted statehood to tales of riding to school bareback and tethering his horse outside the one-room schoolhouse.",
      "His family worked the land and raised livestock, watching the railroad come and go and cattle empires rise and fall. Then came the coal-fired power plants, built throughout northern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico to power progress in distant Western cities.",
      "The plants would play their own role in the history of the region and could wind up at the center of its uncertain future.",
      "The Cholla Power Plant stands just down the road from where Baird, 88, has been building a museum to showcase covered wagons, weathered farm implements and other remnants of frontier days. For years the plant powered the local economy, providing jobs and tax revenues for the unincorporated community of Joseph City, its schools and neighboring towns, but now the vapors from its stacks have dissipated.",
      "These days, change is in the air. Cholla is the latest in a long line of U.S. coal-fired plants to retire, shutting down in March. Arizona Public Service said it had become too costly to operate due to strict environmental regulations. The mandates were aimed at reining in coal-burning utilities, long viewed by scientists as major contributors to warming the planet.",
      "Last month, however, President Donald Trump reversed course, signing new executive orders aimed at restoring \u201c beautiful, clean coal \u201d to the forefront of U.S. energy supplies. He urged his administration to find ways to reopen Cholla and delay the planned retirements of others. As part of his push toward energy independence, Trump has pledged to tap domestic sources \u2014 coal included \u2014 to fuel a new wave of domestic manufacturing and technology, namely innovations in artificial intelligence.",
      "In the West, where the vision of far-off politicians sometimes crashes against reality, Baird and many of his neighbors were encouraged that Trump put Cholla in the spotlight, but there's some skepticism about what the utilities will do with the plants.",
      "\u201cAs many jobs as it gives people, as much help just to our school district right here that we get out of there, we\u2019re hoping that it will come back, too,\u201d said Baird, who used to work at the Cholla plant and has served on the Joseph City School Board.",
      "Yet, he and others wonder if it's too late for coal.",
      "Just weeks before Trump announced his plans, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected a 65% increase in retirements of coal-fired generation in 2025 compared with last year.",
      "The largest plant on that list is the 1,800-megawatt Intermountain Power Project in Utah. It\u2019s being replaced by a plant capable of burning natural gas and hydrogen.",
      "Utilities, already looking to increase capacity, aren't sure Trump's orders will lead them back to coal.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that those plants that are scheduled or slated to retire are probably still going to move in that direction, for a couple of reasons,\" said Todd Snitchler, CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents power plant owners. \"One of which is it\u2019s very difficult to plan multimillion- or billion-dollar investments for environmental retrofits and other things on an executive order versus a legislative approach.\u201d",
      "Last month, Republicans in the Arizona Legislature sent a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum warning that the economic fallout from the 2019 closure of the Navajo Generating Station is still reverberating. The stacks were demolished, and the mine that supplied the plant closed.",
      "At the San Juan Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico, operations ended in 2022.",
      "Stuck in the middle are Joseph City and other communities where life revolves around a power plant. Residents hope Trump can help keep them in the energy race for another generation. From Joseph City to Springerville, they've been preparing to absorb major hits to the job market, tax rolls and school enrollment. Options are slim in Apache and Navajo counties \u2014 two of Arizona\u2019s poorest.",
      "Utility executives told Arizona regulators recently that reopening Cholla would be costly for customers and that they plan to push ahead with renewable energy. The plant\u2019s infrastructure would be preserved as a possible site for future nuclear or gas-fired power generation, and the Springerville Generating Station could be repurposed once the last units are retired in 2032.",
      "The utility that runs the coal-fired Coronado Generating Station, just 30 miles (48 kilometers) away in St. Johns, also has plans to convert to natural gas.",
      "In Springerville, the idea of spoiling the surrounding grasslands and ancient volcanic fields with 112 wind turbines \u2014 with blades standing taller than Seattle's Space Needle \u2014 provokes outrage. Banners and posters objecting to the proposal are plastered around town.",
      "\u201cThey all know that this won\u2019t work, that we can\u2019t rely on wind and solar,\u201d said Doug Henderson, a Springerville plant retiree who now sits on the town council. He says coal-fired generation can accommodate swings in demand, regardless of whether there\u2019s sunshine or wind.",
      "Springerville Mayor Shelly Reidhead and others are fighting to keep the wind farm from happening, saying repurposing the Springerville coal plant would mean more jobs and preserve the surrounding landscape.",
      "\u201cWe also survive on tourism and people don't want to come here and look at that,\u201d Reidhead said of the turbines.",
      "The Western Drug and General Store is adorned with tiny American flags tacked up outside. A sign advertises canning supplies, but locals joke that you can get anything here \u2014 from slippers to rifles.",
      "Andrea Hobson works the register and knows everyone by name. She moved to Springerville about 20 years ago from California and says it's hard to imagine the community without the power plant.",
      "\u201cIt would be a ghost town. It really would,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the heart of this town.\u201d",
      "Springerville\u2019s leaders have lost sleep trying to figure out what industries might fill the void. At stake are about 350 jobs, dozens of contract employees and the businesses they support \u2014 from the general store and the new frozen yogurt shop to the hospital and local churches.",
      "Some workers drive an hour to the Springerville plant every day, meaning other communities also will lose out, said Randel Penrod, a former crew manager at the plant. With retirement looming, the plant has trimmed its workforce.",
      "Henderson, the Springerville town council member, fears it could take years to permit a new plant.",
      "Reidhead is more hopeful after attending meetings with members of Arizona\u2019s congressional delegation and utility executives. She thinks the Trump administration can reduce the \u201cred tape\u201d and get new plants up and running. The development of artificial intelligence and its thirst for power gives the mission a sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cI think our politicians at a state level have realized with AI\u2019s need for the power, that if we don\u2019t get on board and get on board soon we\u2019re going to be left behind,\u201d she said.",
      "Some energy analysts say Trump\u2019s support of coal is mostly symbolic, since utilities hold the keys. Others say diversifying energy sources is a must as the U.S. sees increases in power demand predicted for the first time in decades.",
      "\u201cAI may be artificial, but the electricity it needs is very real \u2014 and in some regions, coal still keeps the lights on when other sources may blink,\u201d said Scott Segal, a partner with the Washington D.C.-based firm Bracewell LLP.",
      "He said power markets don\u2019t care about politics \u2014 just reliability, affordability and sustainability.",
      "Just outside of Joseph City, crews are building what will be one of the largest solar and battery storage projects in Arizona. The solar panels will be installed on leased private land, including Baird\u2019s sprawling ranch.",
      "While not a fan of all the dust being kicked up, Baird knows the advent of solar is just another of many changes he has seen in his lifetime \u2014 and he has no idea what the next 100 years might look like.",
      "\u201cHell, who knows?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, when it comes right down to it, we\u2019ll just wait and see.\u201d",

      "The Legislature adjourned the legislative session late Friday without a budget prepared to be signed by DeSantis, who wields the power of the line-item veto to only approve specific appropriations in a budget package. Lawmakers extended the session until early June after announcing they have a framework for a budget. The governor would need to sign it before July 1, when the fiscal year begins.",
      "The opposition presents a whole new challenge for the term-limited governor who may have aspirations to run for president in 2028. And DeSantis has been amping up his rhetoric against legislators, labeling them the \u201cHouse of Pettiness.\u201d",
      "Here are some key issues that didn't necessarily go in DeSantis' favor:",
      "In January, Republican lawmakers opened and then immediately ended a special session called by DeSantis on Trump's immigration agenda. Determined to tackle the issue on their own terms, they then gaveled back in, tossed out the governor's proposals and presented their own.",
      "The rebuke to DeSantis would have been unthinkable in previous years.",
      "A weekslong standoff ended with the governor signing negotiated immigration measures, which went beyond Trump's executive orders by mandating the death penalty for immigrants without legal status who commit capital offences in Florida.",
      "A Florida House subcommittee began a probe of Hope Florida, an initiative by First Lady Casey DeSantis.",
      "Initially, it focused on a $10 million donation to the Hope Florida Foundation as part of a $67 million settlement between Centene Corporation, the state's largest Medicaid contractor, and a state agency.",
      "DeSantis had asked legislators to create a Hope Florida Office under the governor's oversight. This would have helped boost the first lady's key initiative ahead of the 2026 election, when she is expected to campaign to replace her husband as governor.",
      "Instead, DeSantis has spent weeks criticizing lawmakers' probes into the initiative, accusing lawmakers of drawing negative attention toward the initiative to \u201cattack the first lady.\u201d",
      "Rep. Alex Andrade, who chaired the state subcommittee, announced April 24 that the investigation had ended and he was \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d several parties were involved in a misuse of $10 million in Medicaid funds.",
      "In February, the governor recommended his own $115.6 billion budget proposal for lawmakers to consider.",
      "The proposal included key measures such as $505 million for immigration enforcement and $1.5 billion for Everglades restoration and water quality projects. It also had $2.2 billion in tax relief through some provisions like repealing business rent tax and providing more sales tax holidays.",
      "Yet the House and the Senate still haven't agreed on a budget. House Speaker Daniel Perez told lawmakers to expect to return in June to finalize budget approvals prior to the effective date in July.",
      "The House is seeking a smaller $113 billion budget, contrary to the Senate's $117.4 billion spending plan. One main provision in the House is a 0.75% cut to sales tax, which DeSantis has lambasted. He is instead pushing to roll back the state's property taxes. The Senate plan doesn't include that sales tax cut.",
      "Throughout April, DeSantis repeatedly criticized the House for disagreements on the budget, whether related to Everglades restoration, law enforcement funding or tax cuts.",
      "\u201cThey are the least-productive Florida House of Representatives that we have had in the modern history of the Florida Republican Party,\u201d DeSantis said in an April 16 press conference in Fort Myers.",
      "The initial special session for immigration in January also was meant to address condominium issues, since owners are facing hikes in property insurance rates and increased association costs. Instead, legislators focused on these provisions in the final weeks of session.",
      "A 2022 law passed after the Surfside condominium collapse means condo owners have faced higher costs because associations are legally required to have enough reserves for major repairs. The law also requires a survey of reserves every decade.",
      "This session, lawmakers aimed to relieve some of these cost hikes for condo owners, which mostly affect residents in South Florida and retirees on fixed incomes. The bill was sent to the governor Wednesday, allowing condo associations to fund reserves through lines of credit and give residents more flexibility to pause payments to their reserves while handling repairs and maintenance.",
      "In the weeks leading to the bill's passage, the House and Senate presented two different versions, with the House version widely criticized by the governor. In April, DeSantis said the House bill would allow people to be \u201cdriven out of their homes\u201d and \u201cpave the way for developers to make more money.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet's recognize that these consequences are not what we want, and let's provide reforms to be able to keep people in their condo units,\" DeSantis said of the House version.",

Besides shops offering original artwork, the Village is home to Betsy, a 30-foot-tall, 40-foot-long (9-meter-tall, 12-meter-long) sculpture of a Florida Keys spiny lobster.",
      "Sande Keil, who owns Rain Barrel Village with her husband, said the Keys became part of her family\u2019s heartbeat after the Miami couple bought a vacation home on Islamorada in 1978.",
      "\u201cWhen the Rain Barrel Village came up for sale in 2007, I didn\u2019t see a business. I saw a way to continue our story in the Keys,\u201d Keil said. \u201cThe Village already had a soul. I just knew it needed someone to preserve it and to help grow it.\u201d",
      "Named after the large cisterns that once provided drinking water to the Keys, Rain Barrel Village isn\u2019t just about selling souvenirs, it is about supporting a community, Keil said. As an artist herself, Keil is proud to support other artists, artisans and small business owners and give them a space where they also can build something real.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve poured love, hard work and intention into the Rain Barrel,\u201d Keil said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created something that reflects who we are.\u201d",

      "Artist Richard Blaze completed Betsy in 1985. The fiberglass statue originally was commissioned for a local restaurant, but the business had closed by the time Betsy was done. The giant lobster was placed at another Islamorada attraction, Treasure Village, but she ended up in storage after the location became a charter school. Betsy was relocated to Rain Barrel Village in 2009.",
      "After stopping to see Betsy, visitors can discover the cluster of small, unique shops, along with a garden area and two cafes.",
      "Megan Stennes was visiting the Keys with her family in April and made sure they stopped at Rain Barrel Village on their way back to Palm Beach Gardens. She knew her mother would enjoy all the stores, which she discovered by accident on a previous visit.",

      "William Purser, owner of Sculptured Glass, has been at the Rain Barrel Village for more than two decades. Visitors can watch as he shapes molten glass into detailed figurines of fish, birds and other wildlife common to the Florida Keys.",
      "He discovered the village while visiting art galleries in the Keys and liked the idea of being surrounded by other artists.",
      "\u201cWe all have something in common, and doing your artwork is what it\u2019s all about, whatever your media is,\u201d Purser said. \u201cWe all want the same things from our work. You want to progress, you don\u2019t want to stay stagnant. You just keep growing and growing.\u201d",
      "A place like Rain Barrel Village is great for visitors because the inventory is always changing depending on what the artists are inspired to create, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a type of place, if you\u2019ve been here once, you\u2019ll probably be back,\u201d Purser said. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back again and again to see what\u2019s new. We\u2019re always constantly making different pieces.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good atmosphere,\u201d Chesher said. \u201cThe thing about the Keys is you don\u2019t usually get hassled. Just don\u2019t break any real serious laws, and you don\u2019t have to wear shoes.\u201d",

      "A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a lopsided margin among the small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk\u2019s employees at SpaceX. With all the votes in, the tally was 212 in favor to 6 against, according to results published online by the Cameron County Elections Department.",

Trump's action drew rebukes from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and among Italians.",
      "The image, shared Friday night on Trump's Truth Social site and later reposted by the White House on its official X account, raised eyebrows on social media and at the Vatican, which is still in the period of nine days of official mourning following Francis' death on April 21. Catholic cardinals have been celebrating daily Masses in his memory and are due to open the conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday.",
      "The death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics, for whom the pope is Christ\u2019s vicar on Earth. That is all the more true in Italy, where the papacy is held in high esteem even by nonreligious Italians.",
      "The image featuring Trump in a white cassock and pointed miter, or bishop\u2019s hat, was the topic of several questions during the Vatican\u2019s daily conclave briefing Saturday. Italian and Spanish news reports lamented its poor taste and said it was offensive, given that the period of official mourning is still underway.",

      "\u201cI have no preference. I must say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out a place called New York who's very good. So we'll see what happens,\u201d he said.",
      "Dolan, 75, is one of 10 U.S. cardinals who will be voting in the conclave, but Trump\u2019s pitch might have cost Dolan support.",
      "The reason conclaves are held in secrecy, with cardinals sequestered for the duration, is to prevent outside secular powers from influencing their choice, as occurred in centuries past.",
      "There is an old saying about campaigning for the job of pope or of being promoted excessively, especially by outsiders: If you \u201center a conclave as pope, you leave as a cardinal.\u201d",
      "While Trump attended Francis\u2019 funeral, he and Vance have clashed with U.S. bishops in general and Francis in particular over the administration\u2019s hard line stance on immigration and its efforts to deport migrants en masse. Right before he was hospitalized in February for pneumonia, Francis issued a strong rebuke of the administration's mass deportation plans and Vance's theological justification of it.",
      "Over 12 years as pope, Francis tried to remake the U.S. Catholic hierarchy more in his image, elevating pastors who prioritized social justice and migration issues over culture warriors who were more favored by his more doctrinaire predecessors St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI. A new pope who is more conservative could reverse that effort.",
      "Trump has nominated as his ambassador to the Holy See Brian Burch, whose Catholicvote.org has been aggressively covering the pre-conclave days at the Vatican. It was one of the main disseminators in English-speaking media of a report, flatly and officially denied by the Vatican, that Cardinal Pietro Parolin had had a health scare this past week that required medical attention.",
      "Parolin was the secretary of state under Francis and is seen as a leading contender to be pope. He is also the main architect of the Vatican\u2019s China policy and its controversial 2018 deal with Beijing over bishop nominations -- a deal that the was sharply criticized by the first Trump administration.",

      "The deadline to get a REAL ID is fast approaching after years of postponements and delays",
      "NEW YORK -- The deadline to get a REAL ID is fast approaching after years of postponements and delays.",
      "Starting May 7, your license or identification card will need to be REAL ID-compliant to fly domestically in the U.S.",
      "Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like there will be another delay in the deadline this time. So, if you\u2019re confused about how to get a REAL ID, why you even need one in the first place, and what happens if you don\u2019t have one by May 7, here are some things to know:",
      "It\u2019s a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that the DHS says is a more secure form of identification. Besides needing a REAL ID to fly domestically, you will also need one to access certain federal buildings and facilities.",
      "When the REAL ID Act was signed into law in 2005, it enacted a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission that the government set security standards for state-issued driver\u2019s licenses and IDs.",
      "\u201cREAL ID is a coordinated effort by the federal government to improve the reliability and accuracy of driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards,\u201d John Essig, the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s Security Director for airports in the New York City region said in a press release on April 3. \u201cThe improvements are intended to inhibit terrorists\u2019 ability to evade detection by using fraudulent identification.\u201d",
      "The REAL ID Act was supposed to begin rolling out in 2008, \u201cbut has faced repeated delays due to state implementation challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Nina Ruggiero, senior editorial director for Travel + Leisure. \u201cThe combination of varying state processes and shifting deadlines has added to the overall confusion around REAL IDs and likely led some travelers to take the deadlines less seriously.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019ve gotten a new ID in the last few years, it could already be REAL ID-compliant.",
      "\u201cI also hear from travelers who are confused as to whether or not they already have a REAL ID,\u201d Ruggiero said. \u201cSome people who have recently renewed their license may already have a compliant ID and not know it,\u201d so you may want to double-check yours before starting the process.",
      "A REAL ID-compliant driver\u2019s license has a symbol ( in most states, a star ) in the top corner of the card.",
      "If you live in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont or Washington, it\u2019s possible you could have an \u201cenhanced\u2033 ID card instead, which permits you to cross land and sea borders into Mexico and Canada from the U.S. It does not, however, allow you to fly into either of those countries.",
      "Enhanced IDs will have an American flag icon, as well as the word \u201cenhanced\u201d at the top of the card.",
      "The requirements vary by state, so you will need to visit the website of your state\u2019s driver\u2019s licensing agency to find out the specific steps, including whether you\u2019ll need to make an appointment at a DMV and what documentation you\u2019ll need when you get there.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a REAL ID by the deadline and you\u2019re planning to board a domestic flight, you will need to bring your passport or another TSA-approved form of identification when you travel.",
      "Otherwise, you could face \u201cdelays, additional screening and the possibility of not being permitted into the security checkpoint,\u201d warns TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein.",
      "In mid-April, a group of state senators from Kentucky asked the agency to delay implementing the new requirements yet again. They said the state has limited appointments available to people seeking the new cards and that there has been a rush to meet the May 7 deadline.",
      "However, TSA spokesperson Dan Velez told the AP that the agency does not intend to delay the REAL ID deadline again.",
      "As of late April, 81% of travelers at TSA checkpoints were presenting acceptable identification, including a state-issued REAL ID, according to DHS.",

      "The deaths of at least six foreign nationals in a fiery van crash in eastern Idaho are a reminder that many visitors to two of the busiest U.S. national parks, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and nearby areas come from around the world",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- The deaths of at least six Italian and Chinese tourists in a fiery van crash in Idaho near Yellowstone National Park are a reminder that the roads leading into the popular international destination can be as dangerous as the region\u2019s grizzly bears and boiling hot pools.",
      "The van collided with a pickup truck Thursday on a highway just west of Yellowstone. Both vehicles caught fire, and the survivors were taken to hospitals with injuries, according to police. The tourists who were killed were from Italy and China, officials said.",
      "The Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco said eight Chinese citizens were injured in the crash. The accident comes after a crash in 2019 of a bus from Las Vegas carrying Chinese tourists that rolled over near southern Utah\u2019s Bryce National Park, killing four people and injuring dozens more.",
      "Where the van in Thursday's accident was coming from and going was unknown. Some Yellowstone roads, including the one south of Old Faithful \u2014 the park's most famous geyser \u2014 were still closed after the snowy winter.",
      "The highway where the accident happened south of West Yellowstone, Montana, offers a way to get between Yellowstone and Grand Teton at this time of year, before a north-south route is plowed and the park fully opens for summer.",
      "According to the most recent data from the International Trade Administration, 36% of international visitors who arrived to the U.S. by air listed visits to national parks and national monuments as their top leisure activity while in the U.S.",
      "Seventeen percent of Yellowstone's visitors came from other countries in 2016, according to a park visitor use study with the most recent comprehensive data available.",
      "Visitors from Europe and Asia accounted for the majority of travelers from outside the U.S., with 34% from China, 11% from Italy and 10% from Canada.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic changed those numbers significantly, said Brian Riley whose Wyoming-based business, Old Hand Holdings, markets the Yellowstone region in China and runs tours.",
      "\u201cEvery Chinese is taught how great Yellowstone is in their elementary school,\u201d Riley said Friday.",
      "The pandemic put a sharp brake on tourism of all kinds but especially from China, which has yet to recover, Riley observed. Now, visits by people already living in the U.S. account for most visits by Chinese, he said.",
      "\u201cForeigners in general they don\u2019t feel safe over here like they did before,\u201d Riley said Friday. \u201cThe Chinese are kind of preaching that behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "The U.S. tourism industry expected 2025 to be another good year for foreign visitors. But several months in, international arrivals have been plummeting. Angered by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists being arrested at the border, some citizens of other countries are staying away from the U.S. and choosing to travel elsewhere.",
      "Riley, who grew up in Jackson, Wyoming, just south of Grand Teton and lived in China for a time to learn Mandarin and why Chinese wanted to visit the U.S., is more focused of late on getting them to visit Hawaii, a state perceived as less dangerous.",
      "Yellowstone's crowds peak in the summer, but international tourism peaks in spring and fall, according to Riley and West Yellowstone Mayor Jeff McBirnie.",
      "Many foreign visitors are parents of international students at U.S. colleges and universities.",
      "\u201cThey're like, 'Hey let's drop our kid off and go on vacation for a week.' Or kid's graduating, let's get them through college and go on vacation,'\u201d said McBirnie, who owns a pizza place in town. \u201cThey really bring a huge economic impact to this town.\u201d",
      "Yellowstone suffered a one-two punch between the pandemic and devastating floods in 2022 that cut off access to parts of the park for months.",
      "Tourism rebounded with 4.7 million visitors last year, Yellowstone's second-busiest on record.",
      "Winding roads and natural distractions help fuel numerous accidents in and around the park.",
      "The first death involving a passenger vehicle in Yellowstone came just a few years after the park was completely motorized and a fleet of buses replaced the stage coaches and horses used for transport in the park\u2019s early years.",
      "In 1921, a 10-passenger bus went off the road in the Fishing Bridge area of the park and down an embankment, killing a 38-year-old Texas woman when her neck was broken, according to park historian Lee Whittlesey.",
      "Whittlesey in his book \u201cDeaths in Yellowstone.\u201d chronicles deaths by all means \u2013- from drownings in hot springs, to bear maulings, airplane crashes and murders. Auto deaths, Whittlesey wrote, are \u201clegion\u201d in the park, to the point that he felt them too ordinary to include in his tally of fatalities.",
      "Another accounting of deaths in Yellowstone says at least 17 people died inside the park in motor vehicle crashes since 2007, ranking it the second most common cause of deaths behind medical issues.",
      "Whittlesey presaged the chapter of his book covering road deaths with a quote attributed to the 15th century soothsayer Mother Shipton: \u201cCarriages without horses shall go, And Accidents fill the world with woe.\u201d",

      "THIMISTER-CLERMONT, Belgium -- The memory of blood dripping from trucks loaded with the mangled bodies of U.S. soldiers arriving at a nearby war cemetery straight from the battlefield in 1945 still gives 91-year-old Marcel Schmetz nightmares.",
      "It also instilled a lifelong sense of gratitude for the young soldiers from the United States and around the world who gave their lives battling the armies of Adolf Hitler to end World War II in Europe.",
      "Schmetz even built a museum at his home in the Belgian Ardennes to honor their sacrifice.",
      "\u201cIf the Americans hadn\u2019t come, we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d the Belgian retiree said.",
      "That same spirit also pervades Normandy in northern France, where the allied forces landed on June 6, 1944, a day that became the tipping point of the war.",
      "In Normandy, Marie-Pascale Legrand is still taking care of the ailing Charles Shay, a 100-year-old American who stormed the bloodied beaches on that fateful D-Day as a teenager and fought to help liberate Europe for many more months.",
      "\u201cGratitude for me means that I am eternally indebted, because I can live free today,\u201d Legrand said.",
      "After D-Day, it would take almost another year of fierce fighting before Germany would finally surrender on May 8, 1945. Commemorations and festivities are planned for the 80th anniversary across much of the continent for what has become known as Victory in Europe Day, or V-E Day, one of the most momentous days on the continent in recent centuries.",
      "Ever since, for generation upon generation in the nations west of the Iron Curtain that sliced Europe in two, it became a day to confirm and reconfirm what were long seen as the unbreakable bonds with the United States as both stood united against Soviet Eastern Europe.",
      "No more.",
      "Over the past several months, the rhetoric from Washington has become increasingly feisty.",
      "The Trump administration has questioned the vestiges of the decades-old alliance and slapped trade sanctions on the 27-nation European Union and the United Kingdom. Trump has insisted that the EU trade bloc was there to \u201cscrew\u201d the United States from the start.",
      "The wartime allies are now involved in a trade war.",

      "\u201cFor all those that criticize the Americans, we can only say that for us, they were all good,\u201d Schmetz said. \u201cWe should never forget that.\u201d",
      "After watching the horrors of the dead soldiers at the nearby Henri-Chapelle cemetery as an 11-year-old, Schmetz vowed he would do something in their honor and gathered war memorabilia.",

      "Charles Shay, who is now bedridden in Normandy, was also part of the 1st Infantry Division and came through the Ardennes region too before heading to Germany. He survived the Korean War too and started making visits to the D-Day beaches around two decades ago. Over the years, he became increasingly sick and Legrand, who has helped veterans in one way or another for more than 40 years, took him in to her home in 2018.",
      "He has been living there ever since.",
      "The moment everything changed for Legrand was listening to then U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1984 speaking on a Normandy bluff of the sacrifice and heroism of American soldiers.",

      "Central in Trump's criticism of European NATO allies is that they have happily hunkered far too long under U.S. military supremacy since World War II and should start paying much more of their own way in the alliance. He has done so in such terms that many Europeans sincerely fear the breakup of the trans-Atlantic bonds that were a core of global politics for almost a century.",
      "\u201cThe naive belief that the Americans will, by definition, always be an ally \u2014 once and for all, that is gone,\u201d said Vos. It also raises a moral question for Europeans now.",

      "HANOVER, N.H. -- Sachi Schmidt-Hori has never played Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows, but facing an onslaught of online harassment from its fans, she quickly developed her own gameplay style: confronting hate with kindness.",
      "Schmidt-Hori, an associate professor of Japanese literature and culture at Dartmouth College, worked as a narrative consultant on the latest installment in the popular Ubisoft video game franchise. The game launched March 20, but the vitriol directed at Schmidt-Hori began in May 2024 with the release of a promotional trailer.",
      "\u201cOnce I realized that I was by myself \u2014 nobody was defending me \u2014 I just decided to do what I knew would work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to hate someone up close.\u201d",
      "Set in 16th century Japan, the game features Naoe, a Japanese female assassin, and Yasuke, a Black African samurai. Furor erupted over the latter, with gamers criticizing his inclusion as \u201cwokeness\u201d run amok.",
      "They quickly zeroed in Schmidt-Hori, attacking her in online forums, posting bogus reviews of her scholarly work and flooding her inbox with profanity. Many drew attention to her academic research into gender and sexuality. Some tracked down her husband\u2019s name and ridiculed him, too.",
      "\u201cImagine that! Professional #WOKE SJW confirms fake history for Ubisoft,\u201d one Reddit user said, using an acronym for \u201csocial justice warrior.\u201d Another user called her a \u201csexual degenerate who hate humanity because no man want her.\u201d",
      "Learning Yasuke was based on a real person did little to assuage critics. Asian men in particular argued Schmidt-Hori was trying to erase them, even though her role involved researching historical customs and reviewing scripts, not creating characters.",
      "\u201cI became the face of this backlash,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople wanted to look for who to yell at, and I was kind of there.\u201d",
      "Ubisoft told her to ignore the harassment, as did her friends. Instead, she drew inspiration from the late civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis.",
      "\u201cI decided to cause \u2018good trouble,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI refused to ignore.\u201d",
      "Schmidt-Hori began replying to some of the angry emails, asking the senders why they were mad at her and inviting them to speak face-to-face via Zoom. She wrote to an influencer who opposes diversity, equity and inclusion principles and had written about her, asking him if he intended to inspire the death threats she was getting.",
      "\u201cIf somebody said to your wife what people are saying to me, you wouldn\u2019t like it, would you?\u201d she asked.",
      "The writer didn\u2019t reply, but he did take down the negative article about Schmidt-Hori. Others apologized.",
      "\u201cIt truly destroyed me knowing that you had to suffer and cancel your class and received hate from horrible people,\u201d one man wrote. \u201cI feel somehow that you are part of my family, and I regret it. I\u2019m sorry from the bottom of my heart.\u201d",
      "Anik Talukder, a 28-year-old south Asian man living in the United Kingdom, said he apologized at least 10 times to Schmidt-Hori after accepting her Zoom invitation to discuss his Reddit post about her.",
      "On May 16, feeling surprised and disappointed about Yasuke as a protagonist, he posted a screenshot that included photos of Schmidt-Hori, her professional biography from the Dartmouth website and a description of a book she wrote.",
      "\u201cI felt like maybe they were doing too much of like racial inclusion and changing things,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAn Asian male could have been the role model for so many people.\u201d",
      "Though he didn\u2019t criticize Schmidt-Hori directly, others responded negatively and the image was picked up and shared in other forums.",
      "He was shocked the professor reached out to him and hesitant to speak to her at first. But they ended up having a thoughtful conversation about the lack of Asian representation in Western media and have stayed in touch ever since.",
      "\u201cI learned a massive lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have made this person a target for no reason whatsoever.\u201d",
      "Ubisoft officials declined to be interviewed about the criticism of the game or the harassment Schmidt-Hori faced. In a statement, the company said it carefully researches historical settings and collaborates with internal and expert witnesses, but the games remain works of fiction and artistic liberties are taken.",
      "\u201cWe do not condone harassment or bullying in any form,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are committed to creating a supportive and collaborative environment and we\u2019re constantly learning how we can improve this process. We commend and appreciate Sachi Schmidt-Hori for addressing these topics directly and are grateful for her approach and expertise.\u201d",
      "Unlike the professor at Dartmouth, in Hanover, New Hampshire, most people who become the target of online hate end up retreating to protect themselves, said Kate Mays, an assistant professor of public communication at the University of Vermont.",
      "Online forums allow people to post anonymously without seeing how their words are received and algorithms boost more aggressive content, she said, creating a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for people to become hateful.",
      "\u201cThe intervention that she did was pretty brilliant in terms of sort of stopping that toxic train in its tracks and putting another spin on how people are engaging with her,\u201d Mays said. \u201cShe\u2019s sort of breaking the spell of that online disinhibition community involvement and forcing people to address her as a human and an individual.\u201d",

The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the private CPB, which has said that it is not a federal executive agency subject to Trump\u2019s orders.",
      "The heads of PBS, NPR and CPB all suggested Friday that the order was illegal, and a court fight seems inevitable.",
      "The White House has also said it will be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. Local stations operate on a combination of government funding, donations and philanthropic grants, and stations in smaller markets are particularly dependent on the public money.",
      "WMMT, based in the eastern Kentucky community of Whitesburg, can be heard in parts of five Appalachian states. The station\u2019s general manager, Teddy Wimer, said listeners \u201cwant to hear people that sound like folks that they know from Appalachia,\u201d and the station, which currently operates from a renovated Winnebago called the Possum Den, relies on CPB funding.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in an economically disadvantaged area of the country,\u201d Wimer said. \u201cMost of our listeners who really rely upon our programming don\u2019t have the funds to ramp up their support.\u201d",
      "Livingston said about 30% of their funding comes from the CPB. Right now, he says, it\u2019s too early to know if the cuts will actually happen or what they would impact if they do come through.",
      "Along the West Virginia-Virginia border, more than three hours from Washington, D.C., residents can pick up signals from radio stations far away. But those \u201caren\u2019t going have the local flavor and impact that we do,\u201d said Scott Smith, general manager of Allegheny Mountain Radio. \u201cThis is the only game in town for that sort of thing.\u201d",
      "In his home base of Monterey, Virginia, Smith said there\u2019s about a 4 -square-mile (10.3-square-kilometer) area of cell coverage with one cell tower. The station has proven to be a vital source of information during natural disasters. In 2012, residents relied on it after a derecho knocked out power to 680,000 customers across West Virginia and it took nearly two weeks for some areas to get their service restored.",
      "\u201cYeah, we play music. Yeah, we get on the air and joke around,\" he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re here providing basic level services of information, emergency information, that sort of thing, to our communities. And as part of that, we\u2019re a pretty critical link in this area for the emergency alert system.\u201d",
      "Smith, who has a staff of 10 people, said 68% of Allegheny Mountain Radio\u2019s annual budget comes from CPB.",
      "\u201cWhat CPB does fund the most is small rural radio,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen you take 60% of our income away, that\u2019s not readily or easily replaceable.\u201d",
      "Smith calls it a \u201cwait-and-see game\u201d on whether Congress will act on the CPB funding.",
      "\u201cThe answer to how we move forward is vague,\" Smith said. \"We will still continue to be here as long as we can be.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "More than half of first-time buyers received financial help from their family to make house purchases last year, according to estimates by estate agency Savills.",
      "An average of \u00a355,572 was given in loans and gifts by the so-called bank of mum and dad to buyers, it said.",
      "Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase.",
      "More recently, changes to stamp duty led to a rush of new buyers before the end of March, but greater costs for anyone who missed that deadline.",
      "More help, better deal",
      "The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family.",
      "This was a slightly lower proportion than the 57% of the previous year, but higher than every other year since 2013.",
      "Family assistance peaked in 2009 during the fallout from the financial crisis, when 70% of first-time buyers received help, the estate agency's figures suggest.",
      "It estimated 173,500 first-time buyers received assistance last year, receiving a total of \u00a39.6bn.",
      "The findings are based on first-time buyer and average loan-to-value data, as well as how this relates to responses from various surveys about family support.",
      "The average rate for all new two and five-year fixed mortgages last year was between 5% and 6%, figures from financial information service Moneyfacts show.",
      "That rate would be higher for many first-time buyers unable to offer a large deposit, and much higher than a few years earlier.",
      "Buyers facing that scenario \"took advantage of greater family support to try and secure a deal at a lower mortgage rate\", according to Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills.",
      "\"First-time buyers are still feeling the impact of higher mortgage rates and tougher lending criteria,\" he said.",
      "Mortgages under 4% are back but dangers lurk for borrowers",
      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "Many potential first-time buyers have also faced financial strain from the rising cost of living, and particularly from the greater expense of renting, although the latter may have encouraged more to get on to the ladder more quickly.",
      "The annual increase in rent paid to private landlords breached 9% last year, forcing many to live with their parents in their 20s and 30s.",
      "Financial assistance varies across the country, as do house prices and average incomes.",
      "And stamp duty, which was primarily levied on buyers in the south of England, changed in April.",
      "First-time buyers of homes bought for more than \u00a3300,000 in England and Northern Ireland must now pay stamp duty, compared with the previous threshold of \u00a3425,000.",
      "Data suggests that led to a surge in first-time buyer purchases ahead of the deadline.",
      "Analysis by the Yorkshire Building Society suggests the first three months of this year saw the highest number of first-time buyer applications since the 2022 post-Covid peak.",
      "Mr Cook, from Savills, added that the likelihood of regulators allowing lenders to loosen some of their lending criteria could also benefit first-time buyers and their families.",
      "\"[This means] lowering the barrier for entry and allowing first-time buyers to qualify for larger mortgages,\" he said.",
      "\"So, although more first-time buyer activity may mean more bank of mum and dad assistance, this is likely to be at a lower average cost per first-time buyer.\""

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump says he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said he was authorising the US Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "He blamed a \"concerted effort\" by other countries that offer incentives to attract filmmakers and studios, which he described as a \"National Security threat\".",
      "\"It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. \"WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!\"",
      "US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded to the latest announcement, saying \"We're on it\".",
      "But the details of the move are unclear. Trump's statement did not say whether the tariff would apply to American production companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed tariffs on countries around the world.",
      "He argues tariffs will boost US manufacturers and protect jobs - but the global economy has been thrown into chaos as a result, and prices on goods around the world are expected to rise.",
      "Ahead of his inauguration, Trump appointed three film stars - Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone - to be special ambassadors tasked with promoting business opportunities in Hollywood, which he described as a \"great but very troubled place\".",
      "\"They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK\u2014BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!\" Trump wrote at the time.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub globally despite challenges, according to movie industry research firm ProdPro.",
      "Its most recent annual report shows the country saw $14.54bn (\u00a310.94bn) of production spending last year. That was down by 26% since 2022, though.",
      "Countries that have attracted an increase in spending over the same period include Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, according to the report.",
      "Even before this most recent announcement, the US movie industry had been impacted by the fallout from Trump's trade policies.",
      "In April, China said it was reducing its quota of American films allowed into the country.",
      "\"The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favourability towards American films,\" the China Film Administration said.",
      "\"We will follow the market rules, respect the audience's choice, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.\"",
      "Tariffs on car parts entering the US come into force",
      "Temu to stop selling goods from China directly to US customers",
      "Trump has hit China hardest with his tariffs salvo, imposing import taxes of up to 145% on goods from there.",

      "Beijing has hit back with a 125% import duty on goods from the US.",
      "Other countries currently face a blanket US tariff of 10% until a pause on higher levies expires in July.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he was meeting with many countries, including China, on trade deals.",
      "He added, however, that he had no plans to speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this week - despite previous reports that Washington had approached Beijing about holding trade talks.",
      "Asked if any trade agreements would be announced this week, Trump said that could \"very well be\", but gave no details.",
      "Earlier, Trump signalled he may be willing to lower tariffs on China.",
      "\"At some point, I'm going to lower them, because otherwise, you could never do business with them, and they want to do business very much,\" he said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.",
      "In the same interview, Trump said he may grant another extension to a deadline for China-based ByteDance to sell the US operations of TikTok.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 00:25:01 GMT",
    "summary": "In his exclusive BBC interview, the Canadian Prime Minister indicates how he plans to tackle Trump.",
    "story": [
      "On Mark Carney's final day of a gruelling race to be elected PM of vast and sparsely populated Canada I was with him.",
      "It was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his \"neighbour to the south\".",
      "For someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something.",
      "I recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline.",
      "While this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell.",
      "Carney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: \"President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new reality\u2026 in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win\".",
      "His supporters shouted \"Elbows Up\" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey.",
      "\"What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...\"",
      "At his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went \"unplugged\" among supporters.",
      "\"As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,\" Carney joked. \"So I'm going to govern in econometrics,\" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.",
      "In normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.",
      "When I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.",
      "Fighting threats to sovereignty",
      "Mr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's \"betrayal\" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.",
      "It was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him.",
      "This bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.",
      "The election result was staggering.",
      "Entering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls.",
      "Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide.",
      "But then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened.",
      "Then after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.",
      "The election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump.",
      "Poilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government.",
      "Carney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump.",
      "And incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.",
      "Carney's strategy",
      "Carney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier.",
      "He also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere.",
      "Canada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.",
      "In any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards.",
      "He seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.",
      "On Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.",
      "All roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.",
      "Assuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most of the world.",
      "It is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.",
      "All of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire \"trade deal\" process.",
      "Japan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a \"card\" in negotiations.",
      "The EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.",
      "It comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.",
      "There is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions.",
      "The flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.",
      "As a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.",
      "But Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue.",
      "He will reach across the aisle for a \"Team Canada\" approach to talks with the US.",
      "The Premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.",
      "This is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country.",

      "But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.",
      "The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.",
      "On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was \"a wake-up call\" to government on the issue.",
      "Ways to pay",
      "Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.",
      "The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.",
      "Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.",
      "\"We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,\" a spokesman said.",

    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

      "The new tariff comes days after Donald Trump eased the measure in response to business worries, but did not eliminate it.",
      "The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US.",
      "But analysts said any immediate expansions in the US were likely to come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for the businesses - and ultimately higher prices for customers.",
      "For now, companies have been shielded from pain, as concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge.",

      "The president has since softened his policies, especially regarding Mexico and Canada - key parts of the industry's supply chain, due to decades of free trade between the three countries.",
      "As it stands currently, parts made in Mexico and Canada in compliance with that free trade agreement will be spared the duties. Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.",
      "Trump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.",

      "Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.",
      "Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform.",
      "\"All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.",
      "\"The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses,\" it added.",
      "Supporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (\u00a3600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.",
      "But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.",
      "What was the de minimis exemption?",
      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",
      "In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.",
      "In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.",
      "Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).",
      "Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole.",
      "Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices",
      "And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.",
      "Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.",
      "Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\", adding they would make \"price adjustments\" from 25 April.",
      "Why has Trump closed the loophole?",
      "In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.",
      "The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.",
      "During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.",
      "It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages \"to exploit the de minimis exemption\".",
      "\"These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,\" it added.",
      "The truth behind your $12 dress: Inside the Chinese factories fuelling Shein's success",
      "How Temu is shaking up the world of online shopping",
      "The rise and rise of fashion giant Shein",
      "The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop \"abuse\" of the exemption.",
      "\"The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,\" it said.",
      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.",
      "The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in \"$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers\".",
      "Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.",
      "In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.",
      "In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\".",
      "The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3127.50; $169.35).",
      "Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.",
      "Will US border checks change?",
      "Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.",
      "Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.",
      "There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.",
      "According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would \"shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.\"",
      "\"CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,\" it added."

    "story": [
      "The directors of Moorcroft Pottery have announced the firm has stopped trading after more than 100 years, which the GMB Union says means the loss of 57 jobs.",
      "In a post on social media on Wednesday, bosses at the Stoke-on-Trent firm, based in Burslem, said they had told insolvency business Moore Recovery to help with voluntarily liquidating the company.",
      "They said Moore would contact creditors in due course but did not give an explanation for the firm's closure. However, industry commentators have blamed an increase in energy costs.",
      "Moorcroft had warned in March of possible redundancies and at the time cited rising costs and falling sales.",
      "The news of Moorcroft's collapse is the latest blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, a city affectionately known as The Potteries.",
      "The city is recognised for its global influence with pottery - having been granted a World Craft City Status just last year.",
      "Its official tourist website proudly states: \"We are the World Capital of Ceramics.\"",
      "However, 2025 has proved to be a disastrous year for the city's pottery industry.",
      "In February, Royal Stafford, also based in Burslem, called in administrators.",
      "The firm's collapse followed the closure of Dudson in 2019, Wade in Longton two years ago and Johnsons Tiles in 2024.",
      "In March, Moorcroft warned of the threat of redundancies, stating their energy costs had gone up almost \u00a3250,000 over the past two years.",
      "Great Pottery Throw Down judge Keith Brymer Jones said no business could sustain such an increase.",
      "\"It's incredibly sad news,\" he told BBC Radio Stoke. \"We've been crying out for support for the ceramics industry and Stoke-on-Trent as a whole for years.",
      "\"It's never been considered a major industry in this country.\"",
      "Rob Flello, the chief executive of Ceramics UK, which is based in the city, called for the government to step in and support the sector.",
      "\"Successive governments have just hammered the UK ceramics industry with things like carbon taxes and a whole raft of other taxes that these cheap imports just don't have to worry about,\" he said.",
      "Chris Hoofe, GMB organiser, also urged the government to act, adding high energy costs were \"crippling\" the sector.",
      "\"The closure of Moorcroft is devastating news for workers and their families, but unfortunately it's not a surprise,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We know this will be a concerning time for Moorcroft Pottery workers and their families.",
      "\"Ministers continue to engage closely with the ceramics sector to understand the challenges and provide support, ensuring the industry is globally competitive as part of our Plan for Change.\"",
      "Speaking about the impact of the loss on the city, Brymer Jones said it was about more than just 57 jobs.",
      "\"It's 57 families that are connected to those jobs and the surrounding area, the support network, the shops the cafes that all go with it.",
      "\"We're bloody good at making stuff here, there's a longstanding tradition of ceramics and we sell ceramics all over the world and we literally can't afford to lose this skillset.\"",
      "Moorcroft Pottery traces its roots back to 1897 and has been based at its current site in Sandbach Road since 1913.",
      "According to its website, the firm's founder, William Moorcroft, was able to produce pottery from its current site thanks to the support of London department store Liberty.",
      "After winning a number of prestigious international awards, Moorcroft was appointed as Potter to HM The Queen in 1928.",
      "The firm's royal patronage continued when the late Queen Elizabeth II added Moorcroft designs into the Royal Collection.",
      "The brand was also popular with US presidents and British prime ministers, according to the firm.",
      "City council leader Jane Ashworth said Moorcroft had been a major part of Stoke-on-Trent's heritage in ceramics.",
      "\"Our teams have been working closely and intensively with Moorcroft to try to find a solution but unfortunately this has not been possible,\" she said.",
      "\"The fact is global and national headwinds - including high energy prices and a rash of cheap, illegal forgeries from overseas - have made life very difficult for manufacturers.",
      "\"We have lobbied - and will continue to lobby - the government to provide specific support for this vital and valuable sector.\"",
      "She added the authority would provide support for affected employees to help them find new jobs.",
      "'I feel adrift'",
      "Beverly Berry worked at Moorcroft as a painter and part-time decorator for 36 years, and told the BBC that she felt \"adrift\" and shell-shocked.",
      "\"We had a board meeting with the bosses and we were told that was the end of the line, really, and to get our stuff and go,\" she said.",
      "\"The management were really upset, and we have got redundancy pay.\"",
      "She said that staff had sensed that \"something was not right\" for a couple of years before the news.",
      "\"It was just a sixth sense that things weren't going very well,\" she said.",
      "\"It wasn't a thriving business like it used to be.\"",
      "Ms Berry said she had since registered with the job centre but did not know what she would do next.",

      "Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Gareth Snell submitted an urgent question to the secretary of state for energy and net zero on Thursday, in relation to the firm's collapse.",
      "He said the ceramic sector in Stoke-on-Trent \"is on life support\".",
      "Snell asked the secretary to look at changing the way that subsidies and energy are done for energy intensive industries in the short-term.",
      "He also asked her to rule out moving policy costs onto gas costs, and asked for investment soon.",
      "In response, Sarah Jones said: \"We will not put extra costs on the ceramic industry, and we are looking to see how we can help and support.\"",
      "She added that she could not make promise, but understood the need to act quickly.",

      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",

      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",

      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",
      "Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.",
      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",
      "After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".",
      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",
      "The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.",
      "He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.",
      "While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.",
      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",
      "\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.",
      "While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.",
      "If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.",

      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",
      "Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.",
      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",

      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",

      "An average of \u00a355,572 was given in loans and gifts by the so-called bank of mum and dad to buyers, it said.",
      "Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase.",
      "More recently, changes to stamp duty led to a rush of new buyers before the end of March, but greater costs for anyone who missed that deadline.",
      "More help, better deal",
      "The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family.",
      "This was a slightly lower proportion than the 57% of the previous year, but higher than every other year since 2013.",
      "Family assistance peaked in 2009 during the fallout from the financial crisis, when 70% of first-time buyers received help, the estate agency's figures suggest.",
      "It estimated 173,500 first-time buyers received assistance last year, receiving a total of \u00a39.6bn.",
      "The findings are based on first-time buyer and average loan-to-value data, as well as how this relates to responses from various surveys about family support.",
      "The average rate for all new two and five-year fixed mortgages last year was between 5% and 6%, figures from financial information service Moneyfacts show.",
      "That rate would be higher for many first-time buyers unable to offer a large deposit, and much higher than a few years earlier.",
      "Buyers facing that scenario \"took advantage of greater family support to try and secure a deal at a lower mortgage rate\", according to Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills.",

      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "Many potential first-time buyers have also faced financial strain from the rising cost of living, and particularly from the greater expense of renting, although the latter may have encouraged more to get on to the ladder more quickly.",
      "The annual increase in rent paid to private landlords breached 9% last year, forcing many to live with their parents in their 20s and 30s.",
      "Financial assistance varies across the country, as do house prices and average incomes.",
      "And stamp duty, which was primarily levied on buyers in the south of England, changed in April.",
      "First-time buyers of homes bought for more than \u00a3300,000 in England and Northern Ireland must now pay stamp duty, compared with the previous threshold of \u00a3425,000.",
      "Data suggests that led to a surge in first-time buyer purchases ahead of the deadline.",
      "Analysis by the Yorkshire Building Society suggests the first three months of this year saw the highest number of first-time buyer applications since the 2022 post-Covid peak.",
      "Mr Cook, from Savills, added that the likelihood of regulators allowing lenders to loosen some of their lending criteria could also benefit first-time buyers and their families.",
      "\"[This means] lowering the barrier for entry and allowing first-time buyers to qualify for larger mortgages,\" he said.",
      "\"So, although more first-time buyer activity may mean more bank of mum and dad assistance, this is likely to be at a lower average cost per first-time buyer.\""

      "Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.",
      "\"We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,\" a spokesman said.",

      "Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.",

    "summary": "The real battleground of the current trade war might be China's domestic economy",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

      "Mr Whiteman said school leaders embraced accountability, but it was \"utter nonsense\" that Ofsted's proposed model was the only viable way to assess schools.",
      "He called on Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver to \"scrap these proposals\" and \"think again\".",

    "story": [
      "The biggest names in entertainment are gearing up to celebrate menswear and black style at Monday's Met Gala, the fashion industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "Pharrell Williams and Lewis Hamilton are among the co-chairs for this year's event, which raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.",
      "The annual gala, which takes place in New York City, is usually attended by huge names from the world of film, fashion and music.",
      "Here's everything you need to know ahead of the Met Gala 2025.",
      "What is this year's Met Gala theme?",
      "The Met Gala's theme is usually connected to the Costume Institute's latest exhibition, which this year is Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.",
      "It's inspired by Monica L Miller's book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, published in 2009.",
      "This year's Met Gala dress code is \"Tailored for You\" - a reference to the suiting and menswear which features in the exhibition.",
      "In fact, this is the first Met Gala in more than two decades to focus exclusively on menswear.",
      "\"The theme this year is not only timely,\" said Gala committee member Usher, \"but also speaks to our rich culture that should always be widely celebrated.\"",
      "Expect lots of references from both the male and female guests to the role black style has played over the centuries, particularly in menswear.",
      "The Met says the show \"presents a cultural and historical examination of black style from the 18th Century to today, through the lens of dandyism\".",
      "Who is hosting?",
      "Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who oversees the gala every year, is joined for 2025 by co-chairs Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and LeBron James.",
      "Black talent is also being celebrated with the event's host committee, which includes athlete Simone Biles, film director Spike Lee, actress Ayo Edebiri, pop stars Doechii, Usher, Tyla, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Andr\u00e9 3000, author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and playwright Jeremy O Harris.",
      "When is the Met Gala?",
      "The Met Gala always takes place on The First Monday in May - to use the title of the 2016 documentary about the event.",
      "This year, that means it takes place on Monday, 5 May, with guests arriving from about 18:00 EST (23:00 BST).",
      "It might be a bank holiday in the UK, but for the designers, publicists and PAs, it'll be an extraordinarily busy day as they preen and prepare their stars to walk the grand staircase.",
      "Although the public never gets to see inside the event itself, where the guests are treated to dinner, cocktails, live music and a look around the costume institute's new exhibition, the lengthy red carpet event beforehand ensures acres of media coverage.",
      "The guest list isn't published in advance, but you can safely expect to see a huge number of A-listers on the night.",
      "How can I watch the Met Gala?",
      "Unless you're a New York resident planning to stand behind the barriers across the road from the museum, your best bet is probably to watch it online.",
      "Vogue will be running a live stream of the event across their digital platforms, including YouTube.",
      "US viewers will be able to watch on Peacock and E! Online, while countless news outlets will be live streaming their own coverage on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok.",
      "You can also follow the live blog here on the BBC News website.",
      "But to be honest, photos and videos from the night will be inescapable when you open your social media feeds on Tuesday morning, so if you're in the UK and going to bed, you shouldn't have to look too far for coverage when you wake up.",
      "Can I buy tickets?",
      "No, sorry hun.",
      "The Met Gala is an exclusive event, only open to a small number of invited guests - usually around 450.",
      "Often, the biggest brands will buy a table, and use it to host their desired celebrities. The label benefits if the celebrity is associated with them and wears one of their outfits on the red carpet.",
      "The proceeds from ticket sales go to the costume institute. It's understood an individual ticket goes for around $75,000 (\u00a356,000), while a 10-seat table starts at $350,000.",
      "But at least the A-listers don't have to deal with dynamic pricing.",

      "Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\" after weeks of online backlash.",
      "The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.",
      "Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt \"so connected to love\", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: \"Can we send her back?\"",

      "It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an \"unhinged and unhealed\" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?",
      "'A pattern of failed reinvention'",
      "The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.",

      "For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.",
      "\"That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,\" adds Cragg.",
      "In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.",
      "Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.",
      "The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. \"Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,\" says Cragg.",
      "\"The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,\" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.",
      "It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious \"purposeful pop\" era.",
      "But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.",
      "The 'pop girlie' has changed",
      "Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars \u2013 Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX \u2013 were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.",
      "In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: \"I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.\"",
      "Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.",
      "\"The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,\" argues Cragg.",
      "Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.",
      "But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. \"I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,\" Cragg adds. \"Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,\" he says.",
      "Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.",
      "There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.",
      "Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as \"unbelievable\".",
      "The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.",
      "\"We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,\" it read.",
      "\"Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"",
      "It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Pi\u00f1ata remark acknowledging the backlash.",
      "\"I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,\" Diego tells BBC News.",
      "He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.",
      "But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because \"it's cool now\", he says. \"They don't understand how bad it could affect her.\"",
      "Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.",
      "\"There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,\" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.",
      "So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.",
      "\"I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.\"",

      "Marvel and Disney's newest release Thunderbolts* has proved a hit at the box office, after taking an estimated $162m (\u00a3122m) internationally.",
      "The film, which both production houses hope will kickstart a new franchise, is based around lesser-known superheroes who have to take on human and superhuman threats whilst fighting their own personal battles.",
      "It stars Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan in two of the main roles, alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus and David Harbour.",
      "Whilst not all critic reviews have been favourable, the movie has been a hit with superhero fans - drawing in an impressive 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "It means the film receives the third highest audience score for a Marvel title, tying with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shangi-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Spider-Man: No Way Home.",
      "Not all critics have not treated the film as favourably, with Empire's John Nugent noting that the film is \"missing a bit of colour - literally, in the washed-out palette and CG shadow-threat that dominates the latter half of the film \u2014 and figuratively, in its subject matter\".",
      "He adds that the topics covered, including suicide, depression and domestic violence are \"not always sensitively handled\".",
      "Radheyan Simonpillai at The Guardian gives the film three stars, citing that although the film is \"the best thing to come from the brand [Marvel] since WandaVision\", \"Thunderbolts often irritates because the depression and trauma the movie supposedly grapples with so often lives on the surface\".",
      "Simonpillai is full of praise for Pugh though, \"who can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little\".",
      "However, Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent looks on the film a little more favourably, giving it four stars and calling it \"the best Marvel movie in years\".",

      "The bestselling novelist Robert Harris says a conclave to select a new Pope has a similar dynamic to hit TV show The Traitors.",
      "The author of Conclave, which was last year turned into an Oscar-winning film adaptation, said the programme - in which \"faithful\" contestants are tasked with trying to work out the \"traitors\" among them - was \"the nearest analogy I can come to\".",
      "\"Suddenly everyone swings to one person - you can't see why, particularly, but it happens,\" he tells BBC News ahead of the election to replace Pope Francis, due to begin next week.",
      "\"And in a funny way, a similar dynamic does operate in a conclave, which is why often it produces a surprise.\"",
      "But Harris argues that it is a process UK political parties should learn from.",
      "The writer says his book and the subsequent film illustrates how the ancient, secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a \"rather brilliant device\" for finding the right person to lead an organisation.",
      "Only male cardinals under the age of 80 are entitled to participate. The voting is conducted in total privacy, with the news of a decision announced by white smoke emerging from a chimney on the chapel's roof.",
      "Political parties throwing the election of their leaders open to the wider membership \"has not produced very good results\", Harris says.",
      "It would be better if a select number \"who have seen the candidates close up, day in, day out, choose who the leader should be\", he adds.",
      "He continues: \"To lock the door and say you're not going to come out until you've come up with a result concentrates the mind - and if you look back, the popes have been pretty good.",
      "\"I didn't come away from researching the novel thinking this is a terrible idea [and that] I must write a novel to expose how awful it is. In a way, the novel shows a conclave working.\"",
      "However, the Fatherland and Archangel author thinks it is strange that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.",
      "\"Can any sophisticated religion, with such a huge following, really go on and on into the future with such a secondary, demeaning role for women?\" he asks.",
      "\"I mean, it just seems odd. Would Christ really have only wanted his word to be spread by men?\"",
      "Harris says the character of Sister Agnes - a nun who speaks out during a crucial moment in his fictitious conclave - was a \"vital\" creation.",
      "\"I wanted to find some way of getting the female voice in this process, and the only way is the women who serve the meals, clean the rooms and run the hostel when the cardinals are there,\" he explains. \"I really wanted to make them a part of the story.\"",
      "Harris says that, while researching his novel about conclave, Pope Francis's office gave him permission to visit parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders.",
      "\"They showed me the most extraordinary things and allowed me to walk along the corridor to the balcony where the new Pope shows himself to the huge crowd in St Peter's Square,\" he recounts. \"That was a breathtaking moment.\"",
      "Harris says that, when piecing together the process of the conclave, he realised he had \"stumbled on a treasure trove\".",
      "\"I think that the conclave is a rather brilliant device for finding the right sort of person who can command the respect of the church.\"",
      "\"It's spiritual and human and political drama all woven into one,\" he says. \"A conclave is as dramatic as the reading of a will. It's that level of natural drama.\"",
      "After the publication of Conclave in 2016, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor - who had helped Harris with his research - asked for a copy in Italian to give to Pope Francis.",

      "The film is coming out just in time for the World Press Freedom Day. Words of War was produced by Sean Penn. Anna Politkovskaya is played by Maxine Peake, and one of the leading male roles is performed by Jason Isaacs.",
      "Words of War tells the story of legendary Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya.",
      "In Russia, her name is synonymous with courage and an indomitable spirit. She rose to prominence for her investigations into human rights abuses in Chechnya - a region in southern Russia that fought two wars for independence in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Her older sister, Elena Kudimova, describes her as \"someone who, despite all the threats and the danger to her life, kept doing her work until the very end.\"",
      "Politkovskaya openly criticised the Russian authorities and President Putin himself. Despite receiving numerous threats over the years, she refused to back down.",

      "Reporting the war in Chechnya",
      "From 1999, Politkovskaya traveled to Chechnya almost every month for several years. Kudimova recalls that for many wronged and desperate people, Politkovskaya became \"the last resort\" - the one who could make things right.",
      "She took part in the negotiations for Nord-Ost, the 2002 hostage crisis at a Moscow theatre, after the Chechen rebels specifically requested her.",
      "In 2004, she hoped to help resolve the crisis in Beslan, where heavily armed militants held hostages in a school for three days.",
      "However, she never made it there - she was poisoned on the plane while en route to Beslan.",
      "In 2006, Politkovskaya was shot dead in the elevator of her apartment building in Moscow. Six men were convicted over the murder, but the person who ordered it has never been identified.",
      "Her sister Elena doubts that the mastermind will ever be brought to justice. \"If they had wanted to find him, they probably would have done so by now,\" Kudimova adds.",
      "Avoiding clich\u00e9s",
      "Before the film's release, Politkovskaya's family raised concerns about the Words of War script, believing the film took too many liberties with the truth.",
      "While the filmmakers insist that the drama is based on real events, they emphasise that it is not a biography.",
      "However, Politkovskaya's sister notes that the filmmakers did take the family's feedback into account, and certain scenes that raised the most questions were removed from the final cut.",
      "\"[Anna's son] Ilya was portrayed in the original script as a sort of womanizer, [and in the film] Anna doesn't have a romance with [Dmitry] Muratov,\" she said.",

      "\"Her real life had far more dramatic episodes than those shown in the film,\" she says.",
      "Kudimova criticised the film's setting for leaning too heavily into cold-weather clich\u00e9s.",
      "\"I was struck by the fact that it's constantly snowing, as if Russia has only one season. In reality, we have all four.\" However, Kudimova is grateful that the film helps preserve the memory of her sister.",
      "Anna's legacy",
      "Kudimova said that Anna never thought about her own legacy. She recalled how, at some point, someone had suggested Anna write an autobiography - she was in her 40s at the time.",
      "Anna had laughed at the idea, saying it felt more like something you do when you're a hundred. But then she came up with the idea of writing six short stories.",
      "At the end of each, she said, she was supposed to die - but didn't, for different reasons. And they were going to be funny stories.",
      "When asked about how Anna would want to be remembered, Elena says that her sister did not think about her legacy: \"She simply wanted to live.\"",

      "Her numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.",
      "\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.",
      "Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.",
      "The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?",
      "'An easier ride'",
      "This is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.",
      "But music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".",
      "\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"",

      "Speaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".",
      "She added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.",
      "Blue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.",
      "\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.",
      "Sullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".",
      "Many critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".",

      "\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"",
      "North West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.",
      "\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.",
      "In December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.",
      "The cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"",

      "Similarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".",
      "Almost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".",
      "Hudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.",
      "Pam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"",
      "She explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "story": [
      "To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.",
      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",
      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",

      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of \"as Gaeilge\" rap acts like Iml\u00e9 and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",

      "\"I didn't know what was happening and my parents didn't either,\" says the 15-year-old. \"It was scary. The attacks would occur without warning. It got worse and I began to have them in public.\"",
      "Lucy started missing a lot of school and stopped socialising. She says it was hard for her parents to see her struggling. \"We didn't know what to do or where to go.\"",
      "For six months, she tried to manage her anxiety herself, but eventually the family decided to pay for a talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy.",
      "Lucy says it has made a huge difference. While she still has panic attacks, they are much less frequent and she is back attending school and doing the things she enjoys.",
      "Lucy's story is far from unique. NHS figures suggest one in five children and young people aged eight to 25 has a probable mental health disorder.",
      "Why problems are so common",
      "The teenage years are when problems become increasingly common as young people grapple with the challenges of growing up, exam stresses, and friendships and relationships.",
      "There are biological reasons too that make emotional health problems more likely, says Prof Andrea Danese, an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London.",
      "\"Teenagers' brains don't develop all at once. The part that processes emotions matures earlier than the part responsible for self-control and good judgement. This means young people can feel things very intensely before they've fully developed the ability to manage those feelings, which helps explain some of the emotional ups and downs parents often see.\"",
      "The zenith, he says, is adolescence, when emotional reactions are further heightened by hormones and changes to the internal body clock which impact sleeping patterns.",
      "When and how to help",
      "So, what constitutes normal emotional challenges - and when should teens and their parents be worried and consider seeking professional help?",

      "Providing these are not interfering too much with daily activities, parents should feel able to support their children, he believes.",
      "The most common problems teenagers experience are low mood and anxiety. For low mood, Prof Danese says, maintaining healthy routines around eating, sleeping, being active and keeping in touch with friends and family is important as is planning activities that your child enjoys, such as trips out or playing a sport.",
      "\"And help them identify, break down and try out solutions for problems that may have arisen,\" he adds.",
      "For anxiety, calming techniques are helpful, he says. These can include breathing exercises, grounding, whereby you concentrate on the environment around you and what you can see, touch and smell, and mindfulness activities.",
      "\"It's important to avoid the trap of providing unnecessary reassurance,\" Prof Danese says. Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\"",
      "Building resilience",
      "Stevie Goulding, who runs the parent helpline for Young Minds, says anxiety is the issue they get the most calls about.",
      "\"Many children will have bouts of anxiety and even panic attacks. It's difficult for parents. They can easily find themselves lacking in confidence and judgement about what to do. We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn.",
      "\"The main advice we give parents is to communicate with their children. Give them permission to talk about what is bothering them \u2013 and if they don't want to talk to them, ask if there is someone else they would prefer to talk to.\"",
      "Ms Goulding also recommends talking to your child's school as they may have noticed things too.",

      "But with long waiting times for NHS child mental health services, knowing where to go for help is not straightforward, particularly if you cannot afford private therapy.",
      "The first point of call is normally your GP or mental health support teams that are linked to schools in some areas. As well as referrals to NHS mental health services, they can put you in touch with local organisations and charities that can provide support.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 07:56:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimate included in official review of costs and impact of passing assisted dying law in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 01:19:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",
      "\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"",
      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

      "Kemi Badenoch has said it would be wrong to think a change of leader would \"fix everything\" after the Conservatives suffered heavy losses in English local elections.",
      "The Tory leader told the BBC her party would \"come out fighting\" after losing 674 council seats and control of 16 authorities.",
      "But she cautioned against a knee-jerk response, saying the party's issues were \"not going to be fixed after six months\" of her leadership.",
      "She said: \"Reform had a good night. We had a bad night. And what this shows for a lot of people who hoped that just changing leader again would fix everything is that that's not going to be enough. We tried that previously. And that brought us to a historic defeat.\"",

      "She said: \"We are going to come out with the policies that people want to see, but what we are not going to do is rush out and tell the public things that are not true just so we can win votes.",

      "Reform UK was the big winner, taking control of 10 councils and gaining 677 councillors, as the party seemed able to tap into widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and Labour.",
      "The Lib Dems were the other standout winners, gaining 163 seats and control of three councils. They seized Shropshire from the Tories and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire after both previously had no party in overall control.",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Laura Kuenssberg Labour had \"got the message\" in these local elections and asked voters to \"give us a bit of time\" to change things.",

      "Instead of cake, balloons and fizzy wine he will mark this milestone by announcing an updated \"programme for government\" - as the countdown begins to the next Holyrood election in almost exactly a year's time.",
      "As Swinney told me at a recent news conference, this is not about tearing up his existing programme and starting again but building on what's already there.",
      "Four priorities",
      "It's an opportunity for him to show that his focus is on the day job rather than on dreams of independence.",
      "You can expect him to talk a lot about his four stated priorities: improving public services, growing the economy, reducing child poverty and tackling climate change.",
      "Swinney specifically wants to deliver noticeable improvements in the NHS over the next 12 months.",
      "That's not only because the public wants faster access to diagnosis and treatment but also because he believes cutting the queues is the best way to build trust with voters and to retain power.",
      "He has also promised further economic action which in the short term could be about doing more to ease the cost of living pressures that many people feel.",
      "On 7 May next year the public will pass judgement on what will by then be 19 years of the SNP in government in Scotland.",

      "There has been a remarkable shift in the Scottish political narrative since he replaced Humza Yousaf as first minister.",
      "You may remember that Yousaf brought himself down by ending the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.",
      "That set him up for a confidence vote that he no longer had sufficient support to win and he stood down as first minister.",
      "Swinney's inheritance was challenging.",
      "His was a party fractured over independence strategy, gender politics and environmental commitments plus the legacy of harassment complaints against the former first minister Alex Salmond that were mishandled by the Scottish government.",
      "Then there was the ongoing police investigation into the SNP's finances which has since developed into a criminal prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell.",
      "In July last year the SNP was heavily defeated by Labour in the UK general election but John Swinney, who had only just returned to the political frontline, escaped much of the blame.",
      "It was not that his colleagues forgot that he had been at the heart of SNP government for most of the party's time in office.",
      "It was that many saw him as the only figure with the knowledge, experience and political clout to manage the aftermath of such a major meltdown.",
      "Steadying the ship",
      "Swinney was elected party leader unopposed in May last year and moved quickly to patch up some of the divisions within the SNP by appointing Kate Forbes to his cabinet as deputy first minister.",
      "There have been other changes too.",
      "He no longer has a minister for independence, has shelved plans to pilot juryless rape trials and the creation of a new national care service has been dropped in all but name.",
      "Swinney has skilfully worked to calm controversy and steady the ship.",
      "The UK Supreme Court's decision on the definition of a woman under the Equality Act is another example.",
      "The judges decided biological sex and not acquired gender was the answer.",
      "Swinney immediately accepted the ruling as if it was a minor clarification of the law rather than a comprehensive defeat for the Scottish government by the campaign group For Women Scotland.",
      "The Conservatives are determined that the fall-out from this legal battle at least merits an apology from the first minister to the women who took the case to court.",
      "Instead, Swinney promises revised guidance on the provision and use of single-sex spaces and no attempt to revisit legislation to make it easier for trans people to legally change their gender.",
      "He insists he will protect the rights of everyone in Scotland and hopes that will help him glide past this particular row.",
      "The divisions in his party on this issue suggest his difficulties may not be so easily overcome, although the looming election may help bring different factions together.",
      "Unifying figure",
      "Having watched his old boss Nicola Sturgeon finish her term in office as a deeply polarising figure, John Swinney is attempting to avoid the same fate.",
      "That is why he is recasting himself as a unifying figure - someone prepared to reach out across party lines to work with others to get things done.",
      "Yes, this is the same John Swinney who played a central role in the independence referendum that literally made voters choose between \"yes\" and \"no\" on the question of leaving the UK political union.",
      "To be fair, the first minister demonstrated a capacity for more inclusive politics during the Scottish budget process, making sufficient concessions to other parties so that only the Scottish Conservatives voted against.",
      "He presented his recent \"summit\" with political, faith and civic leaders to counter anti-democratic forces in a similar light.",
      "However, his main rivals think that event, which excluded Reform UK, elevated Nigel Farage's party in the Scottish national debate.",
      "Reform UK is persistently polling in double figures in Scotland and other pro-UK parties are worried.",
      "While Swinney obviously despises Reform's hostility to both immigration and the pursuit of net zero, he also knows they are more likely to take votes from the Conservatives and Labour than the SNP.",
      "After Reform's big gains in the English local elections on Thursday, there is a significant electoral test of their support in Scotland in just over a month.",
      "The Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election on Thursday 5 June, following the death of SNP minister Christina McKelvie, will be widely seen as a two-horse race between the SNP and Labour.",
      "This constituency vote has the capacity to entrench or overturn the prevailing narrative in Scottish politics - that Scottish Labour has lost momentum as a result of difficult decisions by the UK government on issues like welfare.",
      "With a year to go, it looks perfectly possible that the SNP - far less popular than it has been in recent years - could still win a fifth term in office at Holyrood.",
      "If the SNP can hold the Hamilton seat, their confidence will rise.",
      "If Labour can take it from them, it will revive Anas Sarwar's sense that the public mood is for further political change.",
      "Labour thinks they can win if the vote is a referendum on SNP performance in devolved government but they fear that if it becomes a vote of confidence in Labour's decision-making at UK level they will struggle.",
      "The UK Labour government may have delivered record funding to the Scottish government but the SNP will not let the public forget the Treasury's cuts to the winter fuel payment for pensioners, which Scottish ministers plan to mitigate.",
      "Scottish Labour could do with the UK government using its economic clout to help address challenges in Scotland.",
      "They were delighted by the prime minister's promise of \u00a3200m to help secure a future for the Grangemouth industrial site but some in the party would like to see further intervention.",
      "With the Hamilton by-election a month away, the Conservatives start as the third placed party.",
      "They are worried that their new leader Russell Findlay has not had enough time to prevent Reform UK knocking them into fourth.",
      "Whatever Reform's performance, all parties will want to analyse what it might mean if replicated at the Holyrood election where the voting system is designed to make it easier for smaller parties to gain seats.",
      "Without a Scottish leader, a policy programme or an established organisational structure, Reform UK claims to have 10,000 members in Scotland who have turned to them because they are so fed up with politics as usual.",
      "One further twist is that when Nigel Farage turns up to campaign in the by-election he is likely to face detailed questions on recent comments where he suggested he was relaxed about John Swinney continuing in power.",
      "That may make his brand of politics less acceptable to pro-UK voters even though independence has slipped down the political agenda and there seems little prospect of another referendum anytime soon.",
      "Farage's mission in Scotland he told the BBC is to gain a foothold at Holyrood, become part of the Scottish national conversation and then to replace the Conservatives.",
      "That may help to explain why Russell Findlay is leaning more towards Reform UK positions in some policy areas.",
      "For example, he recently called for a more affordable transition to a low carbon economy or what Reform calls \"net stupid zero\".",
      "This type of Tory tilt, designed to stop their traditional supporters switching to Reform, has already cost the party the defection of MSP Jamie Greene to the Liberal Democrats - a significant coup for their leader Alex Cole-Hamilton.",
      "The Scottish Greens who gained significant profile during their period in government and will attract further attention when they elect a new co-leader to replace Patrick Harvie in the summer are among the range of other parties contesting the by-election and the Holyrood campaign in 2026.",
      "Senior SNP figures tell me that independence will feature in their national campaign and ministers have promised one further paper completing their independence prospectus in the coming months.",
      "That said, only the most optimistic independence supporter would predict another referendum in the next five years if there's a \"yes\" majority at Holyrood after the 2026 election.",
      "The issue is not dead but it certainly feels more dormant than at any time over the past decade.",
      "The less that constitutional politics is to the fore, the more space there will be to discuss the competing offers from rival parties on the domestic issues over which Holyrood has control.",

    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Chadsmoor in Staffordshire and Romney Marsh in Kent.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "story": [
      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

    "summary": "The government says there is not enough time to introduce a new misogyny law before next year's Holyrood election.",
    "story": [
      "The Scottish government has confirmed it will not bring forward planned legislation to criminalise misogyny before next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A bill has long been promised to improve protections for women and girls, but ministers now say there is not enough time to draw up a law which reflects the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman.",
      "They are instead going to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex.",
      "The government has also confirmed it will not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy this term, and is hoping for a UK-wide solution.",
      "A new misogyny law was promised after an expert group in 2022 backed separate legislation rather than incorporating abuse and violence against women into Scotland's hate crime law.",
      "The group, led by Baroness Helena Kennedy KC, said this was a better option because women are not a minority, and a \"more fundamental set of responses\" were required to address the \"deeply rooted\" problem.",
      "The Scottish government proposed creating five new offences in its Misogyny Bill including stirring up hatred against women and misogynistic harassment.",
      "Misogyny would also be treated as an aggravating factor in crimes, which could lead to tougher sentencing.",
      "QC shocked by level of misogyny in Scotland",
      "Why are women not protected by new hate crime law?",
      "The Scottish government said it remained committed to ensuring people are protected from misogynistic abuse but it was a \"complex area of policy and law\" which required more time to work out where it would apply.",
      "This would include assessing the implications of the recent Supreme Court judgement that a woman is defined by biological sex for the purposes of equality legislation, it said.",
      "It said there was insufficient time to proceed with the bill in this parliamentary session, but in September it would add the protected characteristic of sex to Scotland's hate crime act.",
      "First Minister John Swinney said: \"We have to navigate a way through all of the issues that come out of the Supreme Court judgement.",
      "\"What action we can take is action we can take during this parliamentary term to tackle misogyny and that's what the government will do\".",
      "Conversion therapy",
      "The Scottish government said it was also dropping plans for a new law banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "Both pieces of legislation were part of the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens which ended in April last year.",
      "Ministers previously said Scotland wanted to lead the way in outlawing such practices - but it has now urged the Labour government at Westminster to legislate on the issue.",
      "Equalities Minister Kaukab Stewart said if an approach covering Scotland, England and Wales could not be agreed, the Scottish government would introduce its own law within a year if it remained in power after next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A joint statement from Scottish LGBTQIA+ organisations said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" to see an end to conversion practices would not proceed - and that the community had felt rights were being \"rolled back and reduced\" for a long time.",
      "The statement said: \"Simply put, the longer it takes to legislate to end conversion practices the more harm will be done, including to those most vulnerable.",
      "\"The failure to progress this bill is yet another blow to our community's faith in government and the institutions that are meant to represent and protect us.\"",
      "Publishing this news in a written question on a Friday morning after elections down south is a classic attempt from the Scottish government to bury some bad news.",
      "In fairness, it is true to say that drawing up complicated legislation before the ink is even dry on a relevant Supreme Court's ruling would be a challenge in the remaining year of the Holyrood term.",
      "But a bill can pass in a matter of days if the political will is there.",
      "And women's groups are already deeply suspicious of the government, given it has spent the last few years engaged in court battle with campaigners about fundamental definitions.",
      "Ministers will point to the move to beef up hate crime law as evidence they are taking action on behalf of women and girls - despite the fact they were originally omitted from that bill with the promise of bespoke legislation.",
      "The point of this move is to get some awkward issues out of the way before John Swinney makes his programme for government speech next week about what he is  planning on doing for the rest of the Holyrood term.",
      "But for all he is keen to get away from spiky debates around gender politics - and you can read the shelving of the conversion therapy ban as part of that too - he is still going to face plenty of questions about this.",
      "Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton MSP said the misogyny bill was the latest in a \"litany of paused, ditched or botched\" policies from Nicola Sturgeon's time as first minister.",
      "She said: \"Misogyny remains a serious problem and it's crucial that women and girls are protected from all forms of threatening and abusive behaviour in a way that safeguards their rights.\"",
      "Scottish Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine MP said: \"This is the wrong thing to do.",
      "\"The proposed legislation was a chance to substantially improve protections, help change culture and behaviours and move us closer to eradicating misogyny.\"",
      "'Screeching U-turn'",
      "Scottish Labour justice spokesperson Pauline McNeill said \"This is a shameful broken promise to Scottish women at a time when misogynistic hatred is on the rise.",
      "\"The SNP has spent years kicking this issue into the long grass by insisting this approach wouldn't work, only to perform a screeching U-turn.",
      "The Scottish Greens said dropping the two bills was a \"shameful backward step\".",
      "The party's equalities spokesperson Maggie Chapman said: \"The misogyny bill was a vital step in ensuring that reports of harassment and assault are taken seriously.",
      "\"LGBTQIA+ people are put at serious risk by cruel, harmful conversion practices that are currently flying under the radar. So-called conversion 'therapies' are deeply immoral and leave lasting damage for survivors.\""

      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",

    "summary": "Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court had provided \"legal clarity\".",
    "story": [
      "The justice secretary has said it is \"absolutely unacceptable\" to question the validity of the Supreme Court after it ruled that the term \"woman\" is defined by biological sex.",
      "Speaking to Parliament's Human Rights Joint Committee,  Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court \"provided the legal clarity in their legal decision which is exactly their job\".",
      "The decision was seen as a victory by women's rights groups but some trans campaigners have argued it did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology and a transgender former judge says she plans to bring an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .",
      "Mahmood said: \"It's disappointing... that some individuals have sought to question the validity of the Supreme Court or cast aspersions...\"",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court",
      "Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces",
      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "The judges said trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the \"potentially vulnerable group\".",
      "The Equalities and Human Rights Commission also published interim guidance after the ruling which said trans women \"should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\" in workplaces or public-facing services.  The same applies to trans men, who are biologically female.",
      "But it said that trans people \"should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use\".",
      "Mahmood was speaking to MPs and peers a day after Dr Victoria McCloud, the only UK judge to publicly say she is transgender, said she is planning to bring an appeal case before the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Dr McCloud, who stepped down from a High Court role last year, said the Supreme Court judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\".",
      "She said the ruling had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\".",
      "Some trans campaigners have expressed disappointment at the ruling. They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",
      "Mahmood told the committee the Supreme Court had \"handled things very sensitively\".",
      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",
      "In her evidence, to the Human Rights Joint Committee, the justice secretary also addressed the government's policy on transgender prisoners.",
      "Mahmood said it \"strikes the right balance\" but \"we will obviously now go back and with the clarity from the Supreme Court just make sure that that policy still stands to scrutiny or whether we need to make any changes\".",
      "The justice secretary said the vast majority of trans women inmates are within the male estate, and she had not moved any trans prisoners into women's jails since taking office last July.",
      "Prison service data for 2023-24 shows there were 295 transgender prisoners in England and Wales, with 51 in female prisons and 244 in male prisons.",
      "But she said: \"No trans women convicted of a rape or serious violence offence who retains birth genitalia would ever be considered for being placed in the women's estate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs despite pledging to do so.",
      "The Conservative leader said Sir Keir Starmer had promised \u00a35m to fund five locally-led investigations into grooming gangs but delivered just one, in Oldham.",
      "During Prime Ministers Questions, Badenoch suggested Sir Keir was \"dragging his heels\" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal.",
      "Sir Keir said Labour were \"investing more in delivering truth and justice\" for victims of grooming gangs than the Conservatives had during \"14 long years\" in power.",
      "Ministers have been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires alongside the review in Oldham, and a three-month audit of national evidence being led by government troubleshooter Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "Earlier this month Tom Crowther, the barrister helping to develop the schemes, suggested local inquiries into grooming gangs had stalled since they were announced in January.",
      "Crowther, who chaired the inquiry into child sex abuse in Telford, Shropshire, gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee at the start of April and told MPs he had asked a government official \"do you still want me?\"",
      "The issue was again raised in the Commons on Monday, when Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips told MPs she expected there to be more than five local inquires.",

      "More local grooming inquiries expected - minister",

      "During a heated PMQs exchange, Badenoch sought to tie grooming gang inquiries to the local elections, a series of councils and mayoral votes across England on Thursday.",
      "The Tory leader said voters faced a choice of \"chaos and cover-ups under Labour councils or better services under the Conservatives\".",
      "Badenoch repeatedly asked Sir Keir for an update on the local inquires. When he did not respond, she said he \"cannot name a single place because nothing is happening\".",
      "She questioned whether the prime minister was \"dragging his heels\" on local inquiries into grooming gangs because he \"doesn't want Labour cover-ups exposed\", adding that the inquiries hadn't started because \"local authorities don't want to investigate themselves\".",
      "A national inquiry was needed as local probes \"cannot force witnesses to appear\" and \"cannot force people to give evidence under oath\", Badenoch said.",
      "Sir Keir accused Badenoch of \"staying silent\" on the issue in government while he \"oversaw the first grooming gang prosecution\" as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "He told the Commons: \"I was the prosecutor who brought the first case.",
      "\"On the back of that I then changed the entire approach to prosecutions, which was then lauded by the government that we were doing the right thing, and brought those prosecutions.\"",
      "In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour were \"implementing existing recommendations\" of the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse and \"providing for local inquiries\", he said.",
      "For more than a decade there has been a series of high-profile cases where groups of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, were convicted of sexually abusing and raping mainly white girls in the UK.",
      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "The Conservative have been calling for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs since the issue was thrust back into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the start of the year.",
      "The proposal was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour figures including Rotherham MP Sarah Champion alongside Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords, Labour's Baroness Hazarika offered an apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the \"sickening, despicable, wicked acts\" of child grooming gangs.",
      "She said that many people in Muslim community were as appalled as anyone else, telling peers: \"This is not who we are\", and added that many of the men were abusing Muslim women as well as white women.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for the the government to focus on implementing all 20 of the recommendations made by the Jay inquiry.",
      "On Monday, party spokesperson Lisa Smart said MPs \"owe it to\" victims to not just \"offer words of support, but to deliver justice and bring offenders to account\".",
      "Reform UK have backed calls for a national inquiry and have previously offered to fund their own.",
      "Party leader Nigel Farage has previously accused both Labour and Tories of \"failing to bring justice to the thousands of victims across multiple decades of these horrific crimes\".",
      "Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said Badenoch \"appears determined to use this issue as an excuse to push her own agenda and try to make political capital\".",
      "\"A leader of a major political party who is serious about tackling sexual abuse and exploitation of girls would put the victims and their needs front and centre and offer support for action to tackle misogyny,\" she added.",

      "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons.",
      "Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests:",
      "These are really bad results for the Labour Party",
      "Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions.",
      "\"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\"",
      "That's not so much the vibe these days.",
      "Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least at having lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever.",
      "Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace.",
      "It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening.",
      "Labour's debate on what to do next is just beginning",
      "\"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\"",
      "That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-test the winter fuel allowance and the more recent announcement that eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment will be tightened.",
      "Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel.",
      "There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise.",
      "To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut.",
      "That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week.",
      "And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else \u2013 the argument goes.",
      "The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away.",

      "I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK.",
      "But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such as Staffordshire and Lincolnshire falling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are.",

      "The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\".",
      "There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment.",

      "Yes, under Farage's leadership Ukip won the European elections in 2014 and the Brexit Party did the same in 2019.",
      "Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt.",
      "Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility.",
      "When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed.",
      "Now its mandate is to make its own voters' lives better. That is a different task. The traditional main parties will be hoping that following responsibility comes accountability, and that if Reform councils and mayors fail, the party's brand will suffer.",
      "It's not just Reform benefitting from the main parties' unpopularity",

It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable.",
      "Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again.",
      "As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose?",

      "Labour had a terrible night when many of the county council seats up for grabs in Thursday's English local elections were last contested in 2021.",
      "So far, today's results are even worse.",
      "Labour should have been within shouting distance of regaining control of Durham -but their vote tumbled.",

      "This has prompted calls for Sir Keir Starmer to change direction.",

      "Labour MP Richard Burgon \u2013 a shadow minister under Sir Keir's left wing predecessor Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 agreed.",
      "He said the current party leadership needed to \"change course\" and suggested that these policies were \"driving away our own voters, and letting Reform squeeze through.\"",
      "The Labour leadership won't be quaking in its boots when attacked by the Left.",
      "But what is noteworthy is that - off the record  - some MPs from across the party are making not dissimilar points, and have been contacting the BBC (and not vice versa) to make them.",
      "One of the new intake of Labour MPs told me \"this is not a verdict on our failure to deliver.",
      "\"It is a verdict on what we have delivered. People on the doorsteps are using the word 'betrayal.'",
      "\"It's winter fuel. It's fear of Pips, it's a bit of immigration.\"",
      "\"People voted for change \u2013 voted for Labour \u2013 but the government isn't looking Labour enough, and people are asking 'what's the point?'\".",
      "Another new MP - very much not on the left of the party - described the withdrawal of winter fuel payments as \"Labour's poll tax\".",
      "And a longer-standing Labour politician said to me it was \"more to do with uninspiring leadership\".",
      "\"And it turns out that cutting disability and winter fuel payments comes at a cost \u2013 these are not Labour things to do,\" they added.",
      "Another said that fellow backbenchers tend to panic close to general election time if their party is behind in the polls but \"we are panicking in less than a year\".",
      "A defeated Labour councillor from Lancashire, Matthew Tomlinson, described himself as \"an extremely loyal Labour Party supporter\".",

      "The Treasury has already rejected this \u2013 arguing that it would lead to higher interest rates and therefore mortgages.",
      "The 40 MPs in Labour's Red Wall group want to see a tougher line on immigration but also more investment in \"left behind\" areas in the Midlands and North of England.",
      "That has prompted demands for the shredding of the \"Green Book\" \u2013 the Treasury bible used to assess the costs and benefits of new projects.",

      "I haven't got any sense that this involves a further change of direction.",
      "The party has already cut overseas aid to fund an increase in defence spending.",

      "But much is either outside the government's control or is difficult to control, such as a stubbornly stagnant economy and an international trade war.",
      "Ministers point to progress on a number of fronts, from rising wages to falling NHS waiting lists.",
      "Yet the election results were an expression of voters' \"first impressions\" of Labour back in power.",

      "Though some of the results are still to be reported, Reform are clearly the winners of Thursday's local elections.",
      "Across the 23 councils where a ballot was held, the party won more votes and more seats than any of its opponents by a clear margin. The party is probably heading for around 700 seat gains and won two mayoral contests.",
      "Meanwhile, it has won overall control of no less than seven councils, including the once Labour fiefdom of Durham and the two largest counties,  Kent and Lancashire.",
      "The party performed best in wards which voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Yet even in places which voted to remain in the EU, the party was still routinely able to win as much as a fifth of the vote.",

That easily beats the 23% that Ukip scored at the height of their popularity in 2013. It is the first time that a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first.",
      "Meanwhile, Reform also won the Runcorn by-election, albeit by the narrowest of margins. Never before has a pro-Brexit party candidate won a by-election, other than two local Tory MPs who defected to Ukip in 2014.",
      "For both the Conservatives and Labour the result was worse than their spokespersons feared. The Conservatives lost two in three of the seats they were defending and at best are likely to be left with control of just one council, Buckinghamshire.",
      "In a clear indication of the Conservatives' vulnerability to the challenge from Nigel Farage's party, its vote fell most heavily in places where the Reform advance was strongest. Their score in the BBC projection is by far a record low.",
      "Labour also lost two in three of the seats they were defending, though it had the consolation of winning three mayoral elections, albeit only by a narrow margin. Their projected share is the lowest since 2008, when the party suffered from the financial crash and the MPs' expenses scandal.",
      "In contrast, the Liberal Democrats were able to withstand the Reform tide, recording over 100 net gains. The party was particularly successful in councils that it had targeted, most notably Devon and Shropshire. Overall, however, the party's performance in votes was largely in line with that of other recent local elections. Much the same was true of the Greens, who made a modest gain of 38 seats.",

      "Once May had stood aside, Jenkyns found favour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed her as an assistant government whip in 2021 and a junior education minister a year later.",
      "A loyal ally, Jenkyns consistently defended Johnson, including during her appearance on the BBC's Have I Got News For You programme, when she described him as \"one of our better prime ministers\".",

      "\"I responded and stood up for myself,\" she said.",
      "She was made a dame in Johnson's resignation honours in 2023.",

      "She then failed to win re-election to the successor seat of Leeds South West and Morley at the 2024 general election.",
      "Bouncing back with Reform",
      "Back in the political wilderness, Jenkyns began flirting with Reform UK last year.",

      "Whether they spill over into 'clear red water' - a phrase coined at the start of the century to describe how the Welsh party differentiated itself from its Westminster colleagues - remains to be seen.",
      "The First Minister, Eluned Morgan, told the Senedd on Tuesday that she will be making a speech next week to outline her position \"more clearly\" on the UK Labour government's welfare reforms \u2013 a controversial issue in Wales, where claimant levels are high.",
      "We do not know how far she will go, or whether she will dip her toe into other areas.",
      "She has plenty to choose from, with decisions made at Westminster affecting steel, welfare, rail funding, crown estate and National Insurance all proving controversial and very current issues.",
      "If she was minded to a year to go until an election, which takes place on 7 May 2026, seems as good a time as any for the first minister to deal with Westminster decisions which she worries might cost Welsh voters and cost her votes.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon BBC Wales saw a copy of a letter the FM has sent to the business secretary in Westminster outlining her concerns about the steel industry.",

      "Tata -the owners of Port Talbot \u2013 are investing in a joint venture with the UK government to build a new electric arc furnace there.",
      "The letter can be seen two ways \u2013 it makes the case for Wales' share of that funding, but also plays into what might be a narrative of the FM trying to differentiate herself from her colleagues in London, or stand up to them.",

      "Some Labour MSs have already made their feelings clear on welfare reform.",

      "The first minister herself has made a veiled objection to comments from her Labour colleague, the Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens, that she had welcomed the reforms.",
      "When Eluned Morgan took over as FM last year a couple of her colleagues suggested to me that she might need a \"row\" \u2013 concocted or otherwise - with UK Labour, to bolster her position.",
      "When she makes her speech next week, will that time have come?",
      "If Morgan does sharpen up her language and criticism of UK Labour's approach, there would still be a risk for her.",
      "If she still does not get what she wants \u2013 especially with big decisions looming from the chancellor in the spending review in June \u2013 then where does she go from there?"

    "summary": "Scientists hope to make a universal antivenom from the extraordinary blood of a man exposed to snake venom for decades.",
    "story": [
      "The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an \"unparalleled\" antivenom, say scientists.",
      "Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.",
      "Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by.",
      "But Mr Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.",
      "In total, Mr Friede has endured more than 200 bites and more than 700 injections of venom he prepared from some of the world's deadliest snakes, including multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "He initially wanted to build up his immunity to protect himself when handling snakes, documenting his exploits on YouTube.",
      "But the former truck mechanic said that he had \"completely screwed up\" early on when two cobra bites in quick succession left him in a coma.",
      "\"I didn't want to die. I didn't want to lose a finger. I didn't want to miss work,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: \"It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite\".",
      "'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'",
      "Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.",
      "But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another.",
      "There is even wide variety within the same species \u2013 antivenom made from snakes in India is less effective against the same species in Sri Lanka.",
      "A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.",
      "That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.",
      "\"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out,\" he said.",
      "\"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'.\"",
      "Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.",
      "The research focused on elapids \u2013 one of the two families of venomous snakes \u2013 such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.",
      "Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences.",
      "Their work, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.",
      "In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.",
      "This is \"unparalleled\" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it \"likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom\".",
      "The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.",
      "The other class of snake \u2013 the vipers \u2013 rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.",
      "\"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes,\" said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.",
      "And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.",
      "\"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,\" said Prof Kwong.",
      "The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.",
      "Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was \"certainly novel\" and provided \"a strong piece of evidence\" that this was a feasible approach.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.\"",
      "But he cautioned there was \"much work to do\" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.",
      "But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage \"makes me feel good\".",
      "\"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me. I'm proud of it. It's pretty cool.\""

    "story": [
      "As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest.",
      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",
      "It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.",
      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",
      "We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.",
      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",

    "story": [
      "A Scottish summer is synonymous with the humble yet pesky midge.",
      "But Glasgow University scientists have confirmed the continued rise of its distant cousin - the mosquito.",
      "The country is now home to more than 20 different species of the biting insect, and some have been identified in Shetland - the most northern location to date.",
      "More commonly associated with tropical climes, mosquitoes are a natural part of the Scottish ecosystem.",
      "The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.",
      "Midge bite or a mosquito?",
      "University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible.",
      "Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people.",
      "Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project.",
      "After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home.",
      "While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year.",
      "The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",
      "\"In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.\"",
      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",
      "\"Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.\"",
      "Is malaria a risk?",
      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",
      "Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.",
      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",
      "The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.",
      "Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks.",

      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",

    "story": [
      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:27:52 GMT",
    "summary": "The new satellite will be able to see through clouds and forest canopies.",
    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "Last week, the European Commision - the EU's executive - announced it had decided that the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m).",

      "They would not apply to users in the UK, where Meta has not implemented its ad-free subscription model.",
      "It is currently in discussions with the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), about a similar model for UK users and what it might look like.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told the BBC it was engaging with the ICO to ensure its service satisfies regulatory expectations \"while delivering the UK Government's commitment to ensure that regulators and regulation support growth\".",
      "\"Personalised advertising on our platforms drives over \u00a319.5 billion in revenues for UK businesses every year,\" they added.",
      "Eric Seufert, analyst at Mobile Dev Memo, said Meta may be trying to strategically turn European users into \"vocal cheerleaders\" for its products amid a regulatory clampdown.",
      "\"What they ultimately want to do is turn public opinion against this regulatory regime which will demonstrably degrade the product offerings that are available to EU residents,\" Seufert told the BBC in a phone interview after the announcement.",
      "Meta, formerly known as Facebook, includes the social media network in addition to the photo sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp.",
      "The Commission has said that Meta's consent-or-pay model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used.",
      "The body is currently assessing another option Meta introduced last year, which the company says uses less personal data to display advertisements.",
      "Meta was given 60 days to comply with the DMA's recent decision, or risk further fines.",

      "Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results showed that Meta has gone \"full throttle on investments in AI\".",
      "Britzman also noted the 6% jump in daily active users.",
      "\"There had been some concerns that we might see a slowdown in new users this year, but this was a very strong start and a signal to investors that Meta's family of apps has a grip on users that's hard to displace,\" Britzman said.",
      "The recent rollout of its Meta AI chatbot to users in Europe was met with ire by some WhatsApp users, however.",
      "Meta defended the \"optional\" tool that users cannot remove, saying it would listen to user feedback.",

      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",

      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",

      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",

      "\"The General Security department told us not to harm civilians, but only to shoot at insurgents who shot at us,\" he told me.",
      "\"There were eight men with me, but it was a large group, and the General Security department was overseeing things so that no-one would vandalise the village or harm the residents.\"",
      "He later filmed himself shooting dead a 64-year-old village resident, Mahmoud Yusef Mohammed, at the entrance to his house.",
      "Abu Khalid, who has now been arrested, insisted Mahmoud was an armed insurgent - but video he filmed of the incident does not support his account.",
      "Military police told the BBC there had been no coordination between security forces and Abu Khalid.",
      "Human rights groups estimate that almost 900 civilians, mainly Alawites, were killed by pro-government forces across Syria's coastal region in early March.",
      "The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam and its followers make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni.",
      "Syria's coastal area - a stronghold of the former regime - has been largely sealed off, but a BBC team gained access, speaking to witnesses and security officials about what happened in Sanobar.",
      "The violence came a day after fighters loyal to the country's overthrown former President Bashar al-Assad, who is an Alawite, led deadly raids on government security forces.",
      "The new Sunni Islamist-led government had called for support from various military units and militia groups to respond to those raids \u2013 but that escalated into a wave of sectarian anger aimed at Alawite civilians.",
      "Witnesses told the BBC that several different armed groups had targeted Alawites for summary executions. Some also said that government security forces had battled violent and extremist factions to protect Alawite villagers from attack.",
      "When the violence along this coast erupted, the village of Sanobar was right in its path. Some 200 people were wiped out from this small Alawite village, over the course of a few days in early March.",
      "Almost two months after the killings, there have been no funerals in Sanobar.",
      "A mass grave now squats beside the winding village road. Hurried burials have cleared the remaining corpses.",
      "This is now a village of women and secrets. Most survivors are still too scared to speak openly but their stories, shared with us privately, are often strikingly similar.",
      "The body of Mahmoud Yousef Mohammed lay outside his simple breeze-block house in Sanobar for three days after he was shot dead.",
      "His wife, daughter and grandchildren, sheltering in a neighbour's house, were too afraid to emerge from hiding and bury him, as armed groups roamed the village.",
      "His family said Mahmoud was a polite man, known and respected in the village; a farmer with a military background, who sometimes worked as a minibus driver.",
      "His house, on a quiet street at the edge of the village, stands less than 300m (985ft) from the main highway where, on 6 March, army officers from Syria's former regime led co-ordinated attacks on the country's new security forces.",
      "For two days, government forces battled former regime fighters, known locally as \"filoul\" (\"remnants\"), in the villages along this coastal highway, calling for support from allied militia groups who helped push Bashar al-Assad from power last year.",
      "An array of armed supporters responded to the call, including foreign jihadist fighters, civilians and armed units now nominally part of the new Syrian army, but still not fully under government control. All are groups now accused by survivors of civilian executions.",
      "All day on 7 March, Sanobar residents listened to the sounds of intense fighting around the village, as families hid in their houses.",
      "Then the targeting of civilians began.",
      "\"All day, many groups entered our house,\" one survivor from Sanobar told me. \"They weren't from the [military] groups based here, but from Idlib, Aleppo and elsewhere. Some wore camouflage uniforms. But the ones who killed us were wearing green uniforms with a mask.\"",
      "\"They stole everything, insulted us, threatened the children,\" she continued. \"The last group came around 6pm. They asked, 'Where are the men?' and took my father and my brother Ali. We begged them not to kill them. They said, 'You're Alawite, pigs,' and shot them in front of our eyes.\"",
      "Some time that day, Mahmoud stepped outside the building he was sheltering in with his family. One of his relatives said he could smell toxic fumes from a fire nearby, and wanted to check on his own house.",
      "He never reappeared.",
      "\"We found the next morning that he had been killed,\" the relative told us.",
      "The story of what happened to Mahmoud began to emerge when a video of his killing surfaced on social media, filmed by the man who shot him.",
      "In the video, Abu Khalid is seen grinning and taunting Mahmoud from the back of a motorbike before shooting him six times.",
      "To meet Abu Khalid, we travelled to Idlib, the heartland of transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which swept Syria's old regime from power last December.",
      "Now in military police custody pending an investigation, Abu Khalid shuffled into the room, blinking and stretching as his blindfold and handcuffs were removed.",
      "A young man in camouflage pants, he seemed keen to talk, explaining that Mahmoud was not a civilian, but an insurgent who was fighting in the village that day, and had been carrying an 8.5mm-calibre rifle when he shot him.",
      "\"I turned the camera on him and told him to sit down,\" Abu Khalid told me. \"He was running away and he wanted to kill me, so I shot him in the shoulder and the leg. When I got closer, I saw him moving his hand as if he had a bomb or a gun. I was afraid, so I killed him.\"",
      "But the video Abu Khalid filmed of the shooting - its location and timing verified by the BBC - does not support his account.",
      "A former member of the British special forces confirmed that there was no weapon visible on or near Mahmoud at any point in the video.",
      "And at no point does Abu Khalid ask the 64-year-old to stop or sit down - nor does he appear scared or under threat.",
      "Instead, he is shown whooping and grinning on the back of the motorbike, before calling out to Mahmoud, \"I've caught you, I've caught you! Look at the camera!\"",
      "He then shoots him three times in quick succession. Mahmoud falls to his knees inside the doorway of his house.",
      "\"You didn't die?!\" Abu Khalid calls out, as he follows him to the building.",
      "Mahmoud can be heard begging for his life, before Abu Khalid shoots him three more times at close range.",
      "International law forbids the killing of civilians, the injured, or disarmed fighters.",
      "Khaled Moussa, from the military police unit now holding Abu Khalid, said he had gone to fight in Sanobar without coordination with the security forces.",
      "\"Civilians are not supposed to be there during military operations,\" Mr Moussa said. \"He made a mistake. He could have captured the person, but instead he killed him.\"",
      "But Abu Khalid has little regret for what he did.",
      "When he cries during our interview, it's not for Mahmoud - or even for himself. It's for his little brother, killed in a bomb attack by President Assad's former army in 2018 as his family sat down at home to break their Ramadan fast.",
      "\"He was eight years old, and I held him while his soul left his body,\" he told me, before tears start flowing down his face.",
      "\"I was raised during the revolution, and saw nothing but injustice, blood, killing and terror. They ignore everything that happened in Syria before the liberation, and focus on the video I filmed.\"",
      "He tells me his family's latest casualty was his 17-year-old cousin, killed while fighting insurgents near Sanobar. \"He was completely burned,\" he said. \"We took him away in a plastic bag.\"",
      "\"If I was going for revenge for what they did to us, I wouldn't have left any of them.\"",
      "The insurgent attacks on 6 March ripped open sectarian fault-lines that Syria's new Islamist government had tried to paper over with promises of tolerance and inclusion.",
      "The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), an independent monitoring group, says former regime loyalists killed at least 446 civilians, including 30 children and women, and more than 170 government security forces, most of them on 6 March.",
      "Those attacks resurrected deep-seated anger over the repressive dictatorship of former President Assad, with Alawite civilians seen by some as complicit in the crimes of his regime - and as part of the insurgency that followed his fall.",
      "The SNHR says the government's crackdown on insurgents on the coast \"escalated into widespread and severe violations\", most of which were \"retaliatory and sectarian\".",
      "The group says that pro-government forces and supporters killed at least 889 civilians, including 114 children and women, in the days following the insurgent attacks.",
      "Amnesty International has investigated dozens of attacks it says were \"deliberate\", \"unlawful\" and targeted at Alawite civilians.",
      "One video from Sanobar shows a pro-government fighter marching through the village chanting, \"ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Lists of victims from the village, compiled by local activists, include the names of more than a dozen women and children, including an 11-year-old, a pregnant woman and a disabled man.",
      "The survivor who watched gunmen kill her father and brother said the family showed their killers the men's civilian ID cards to prove they hadn't been part of Assad's army. But it made no difference; their only accusation, she said, was that the family were \"Alawite pigs\".",
      "Separating civilians from insurgents is key to the new government's plan to secure the country, and its promise to protect minorities.",

      "Sharaa's HTS group - once the local affiliate of al-Qaeda and still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US and UK - formed the backbone of his new army.",
      "There has been rapid recruitment to fill the ranks of a new civilian police and the General Security Forces.",
      "Training has reportedly been shortened and many units say they are under-equipped. One commander looked wistfully at my body-armour and radio when we joined them on a patrol. \"We don't have those,\" he said.",
      "Turkish-backed militia and jihadist fighters who once fought alongside HTS to remove Bashar al-Assad are among those named by witnesses and human rights groups as carrying out summary executions.",
      "In the streets of Sanobar, the names of Turkish-backed units, now supposedly under government control, have been graffitied on the walls, and the BBC heard several reports that their men were still present in the village.",
      "Some videos of alleged violations also appear to show the presence of vehicles and uniforms from the official General Security Forces - prompting Amnesty International to call for investigation.",
      "The head of the General Security Forces for the Latakia region, Mustafa Kunaifati, told me that civilians with friends or relatives in the army were responsible for most of the crimes, but admitted that members of armed groups had also been involved - including what he called \"individual cases\" from his own General Security units.",
      "\"It happened,\" he said, \"and those members were also arrested. We can't accept something like that.\"",
      "After the former regime fighters were expelled and the situation brought under control, he said his men \"began removing all the rioters from the area and arresting anyone who had harmed civilians\".",
      "Several witnesses have confirmed to the BBC that Mr Kunaifati's forces intervened to protect them from other armed groups.",
      "One of Mahmoud's neighbours in Sanobar told us they evacuated him and his family 30 minutes before Mahmoud was killed.",
      "And the witness who described the killing of her father and brother said the General Security Forces had helped them escape the village, and later to return and bury their relatives.",

      "Simion is an admirer of US President Donald Trump. He told the BBC that he believes in a strong Nato, and is in favour of keeping Nato bases and US troops in Romania, if he becomes president.",
      "In February, US Vice-President JD Vance sharply criticised Romania for the annulment of the poll, sending shockwaves through a Romanian political establishment that leans heavily on its special relationship with the US.  Georgescu was nevertheless barred from taking part in the rerun.",
      "The result is awaited nervously in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv and Moscow. Romania is an important transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. The country has a US missile defence shield at Deveselu, and three major airbases from which Nato flies air policing missions up to the border of Ukraine and Moldova, and out over the Black Sea.",
      "Ukraine exports 70% of its grain down the Black Sea coast, through Romanian territorial waters, towards Istanbul. The Romanian navy demines those waters, and the Romanian air force trains Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania. A visa-waiver agreement was abruptly cancelled on the eve of the election.",
      "\"Forget about any more help to Ukraine if Simion becomes president,\" says George Scutaru, a security expert at the New Strategy Center in Bucharest. As head of the National Security Council, the president can veto any decision, and has a strong influence on security policy. But Scutaru expresses \"prudent optimism\" that one of the centrists will win the run-off.",
      "But in an interview with the BBC, Simion made it clear he thinks \"Russia is the biggest danger towards Romania, Poland and the Baltic states, the problem is this war is not going anywhere.\"",
      "He said he hoped the peace talks organised by the Trump administration would result in a ceasefire and peace negotiations.",
      "Public resentment at Romanian financial support for Ukrainian refugees has been a central plank in Simion's campaign, though he denies he is pro-Russian.",
      "On a baking May afternoon, crowds of sightseers throng the gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence in the west of Bucharest. The decision by interim President Ilie Bolojan to open the buildings and gardens to the public is very popular among the visitors.",
      "White and purple irises line the paths beneath ancient horse chestnuts in full flower. A military band marches among flowerbeds of pansies and violets. The palace is a former monastery, converted in the 17th century, which became home to the Romanian royal family in the 19th century.",
      "\"I can't really imagine Simion in here\u2026\" Ionut, a satirical writer, tells me beside an ornate waterfall, looking up at the palace walls. He voted for Simion in the first round of the election last November, out of anger at the constant delays to Romania's full membership of the Schengen free-travel zone. And frustration with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis.",
      "But Romania finally joined the Schengen land-borders on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. \"Romanians are less angry now,\" he believes. He told his daughter he will vote for Nicusor Dan in this election, but hasn't quite made up his mind.",
      "Ana, a management consultant, walking with her family through the palace gardens, also supports Nicusor Dan. \"I want to vote for both continuity and change,\" she says. \"Continuity in Romania's relationship with Europe, but change as far as corruption is concerned. We young people don't relate to the old parties any more,\" - something Nicusor Dan has in common with Simion.",
      "Many in Romania's large diaspora  - a million are registered to vote - have already cast their ballots, especially in Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK. They are invisible in opinion polls, and could easily sway the final result.",
      "Final ruling bars far-right Georgescu from Romanian vote",

    "summary": "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war with at least 45,287 killed.",
    "story": [
      "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.",
      "This is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.",
      "At the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to establish that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.",
      "The BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.",
      "So far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.",
      "20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces in 2024.",
      "Among the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.",
      "They had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.",
      "Bairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.",
      "In February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.",
      "Okhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.",
      "Unlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.",
      "In total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.",
      "A few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.",
      "There was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.",
      "A relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"",
      "In our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.",
      "In the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.",
      "In 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.",
      "In the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.",
      "In 2023, the number rose to 37,633.",
      "In 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.",
      "In August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.",
      "However, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.",
      "\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.",
      "After almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.",
      "According to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.",
      "Even then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.",
      "The cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.",
      "Actual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.",
      "Overall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land. This means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.",
      "How losses are changing recruitment",
      "Russia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.",
      "\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.",
      "One-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.",
      "We also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.",
      "Volunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.",
      "In 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.",
      "One Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.",
      "The one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).",
      "Calculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.",
      "This is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.",
      "The true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.",
      "An assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.",
      "That would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel."

      "It is not clear what prompted them to kill the group.",

    "story": [
      "When the Catholic Church elects a new pope, the world watches not for a press conference or social media post, but for rising smoke from a small chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.",
      "If the smoke is black, no new pope has been chosen. If it is white, a decision has been made: Habemus Papam - we have a pope. It's high drama, broadcast live to millions.",
      "But what viewers don't see is the centuries-old ritual's hidden complexity: the carefully built chimney, the engineered stove and the precise chemical recipes, each part painstakingly designed to ensure that a wisp of smoke carries a clear message.",
      "Experts told the BBC that the process requires \"two custom fireworks\", smoke test rehearsals and Vatican firefighters on standby. It is meticulously organised by a team of engineers and Church officials working in unison.",
      "Pope Francis died on Easter Monday aged 88 and with the funeral now over, attention has turned to the conclave - a private meeting through which a new pope will be chosen.",
      "The Vatican has confirmed that cardinals will meet at St Peter's Basilica on 7 May to celebrate a special Mass before gathering inside the Sistine Chapel, where the complex vote will commence.",
      "The tradition of burning the cardinals' paper ballots dates back to the 15th Century and became part of conclave rituals aimed at ensuring transparency and preventing tampering, particularly after earlier papal election delays had led to public frustration and unrest.",
      "Over time, the Vatican began using smoke as a way to communicate with the outside world while preserving the strict confidentiality of the vote.",
      "And today, despite countless advances in communication, the Vatican has chosen to preserve the tradition.",
      "\"From antiquity onwards people have seen rising smoke - of animal and grain sacrifices in the Bible, or of burning incense in tradition - as a form of human communication with the divine,\" Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC.",
      "\"In Catholic tradition, prayers 'ascend' to God. The use of smoke evokes these religious rituals and the aesthetics of wonder and mystery that accompany them.\"",
      "Prof Moss also says that the rising smoke allows people gathering in St Peter's Square \"to feel included - as if they are incorporated into this mysterious and secretive affair\".",
      "The reasons are symbolic, but making it work in the 21st Century requires real-world engineering.",
      "Inside the Sistine Chapel, two stoves are temporarily installed specifically for the conclave: one for burning ballots, the other to generate the smoke signals.",
      "Both stoves are connected to a small flue - a pipe within a chimney that allows smoke to escape - that leads up through the chapel roof to the outside. On Friday, fire crews were seen on the roof, carefully securing the chimney top into place, while workmen erected scaffolding and constructed the stoves inside.",
      "The Sistine Chapel, which was built more than 500 years ago, is home to one of the most famous ceilings in the world. Adorned with Michelangelo's frescoes, it is not exactly designed for smoke signals, and the chimney needs to be installed discreetly and safely.",
      "It's a complex process. Technicians either use an existing opening or create a temporary hatch through which the flue - typically made of a metal such as iron or steel - is inserted. The pipe runs from the stoves to the outside, emerging through the tiled roof above St Peter's Square.",
      "Every joint is sealed to prevent leaks and every component is tested. Specialists rehearse smoke tests in the days before the conclave begins, ensuring the chimney draw works in real time. Even Vatican firefighters are involved; on standby in case of malfunction.",
      "\"This is such a precise process because if one thing goes wrong, it's not just a technical failure - it becomes an international incident,\" Kevin Farlam, a structural engineer who has worked on heritage properties, told the BBC. \"It's not like putting a pipe on a pizza oven. Every part of the system has to be installed without damaging anything.\"",
      "This setup is constructed days before the cardinals arrive and is dismantled once a pope has been chosen.",
      "To ensure the signal is visible, Vatican technicians use a combination of chemical compounds.",
      "\"What they're essentially building here is two custom fireworks,\" Prof Mark Lorch, head of the department of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Hull, told the BBC.",
      "\"For black smoke, a mix of potassium perchlorate, anthracene, and sulfur is burned - producing thick, dark smoke.",
      "\"For white smoke, a combination of potassium chlorate, lactose, and pine rosin, is used, which burns clean and pale.",
      "\"In the past they tried to burn damp straw to create a darker smoke and dry straw to make lighter smoke - but this caused some confusion because sometimes it appeared grey.\"",
      "He explained that these chemicals are \"pre-packed into cartridges and ignited electronically\" so there's no ambiguity.",
      "The addition of bell ringing - introduced during Pope Benedict XVI's election - now serves as confirmation and is used alongside the smoke signal.",
      "Over the years, there have been suggestions to modernise the system: coloured lights, digital alerts, or even televised votes. But for the Vatican, the ritual is not just a communication tool - it's a moment of continuity with centuries of tradition.",
      "\"This is about tradition and secrecy, but it has real theological heft to it as well,\" Prof Moss said.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 23:03:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

      "At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were shot dead on Tuesday before the celebrations started.",
      "The horror left many shaken in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students.",
      "The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle heaviness hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city.",
      "And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the shooting took place close to Vaksala Square.",
      "'I knew something had happened'",
      "\"It's really sad,\" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the shootings, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. \"I think if I was there [on Tuesday]\u2026I would be, like, involved in the shooting. And it's a bit scary.\"",
      "According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they were shot in the head just after 5pm on Tuesday.",
      "The city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats.",
      "Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs which many mistook for fireworks. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down the suspect. Local media reported that he had worn a mask and used an electric scooter to get away from the scene.",
      "\"I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,\" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay.",
      "Around two hours after the shootings, police arrested a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion.",
      "However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.",
      "On Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of carrying out the killings.",
      "People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the shooting was likely an \"isolated incident\".",
      "While many were shaken, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps.",
      "\"I don't really feel so scared,\" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the shootings happened. \"It feels like there's more security, more cops about.\"",
      "His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in G\u00e4vle, two hours north, to \"have fun and meet new people\".",
      "She reflects that she no longer has a \"strong\" reaction to news about shootings in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. \"There's been so many shootings lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.\"",
      "A hotspot for gun violence",
      "Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for gun crime, often linked to criminal networks. Research for Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of perpetrators is \"increasingly younger\", with growing numbers of teenagers both carrying out or dying from gun violence.",
      "Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala shooting took place, but has since described it as \"an extremely violent act\".",
      "\"This underlines that the wave of violence is not over - it continues,\" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday.",
      "At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the deaths were linked to gang crime, but said it was too soon to confirm this.",
      "Police in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for gangs to contract vulnerable children to carry out crimes, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden.",
      "Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to teenage gangs.",
      "Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's gun laws.",
      "In February, 10 people were killed in the country's worst mass shooting at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the killings. He legally owned a weapon, and was found dead inside the building.",

      "Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in gang crime but knows plenty of others who have.",
      "\"Many times in my school, there was gang violence, and in the streets - dealers,\" he says. \"But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 23:26:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Western alliances unravel, Europe is entering an era that seems distant from what VE Day represented, the BBC's Katya Adler writes.",
    "story": [
      "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.",
      "The top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.",
      "So much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.",
      "But 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.",
      "But is that accurate, or too simplistic?",
      "Russia - divisions from the start",
      "To get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.",
      "By 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.",
      "\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.",
      "\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"",
      "Splits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.",
      "Depending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.",
      "Western Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.",
      "But people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.",
      "As a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".",
      "\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.",
      "Czechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"",
      "Russia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.",
      "For VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.",
      "The official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.",
      "That invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.",
      "\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"",
      "The US - a marriage of convenience",
      "This is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.",
      "Europe has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.",
      "But this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.",
      "Following WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.",
      "The idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.",
      "Might we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.",
      "\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.",
      "The war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.",
      "Europe, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.",
      "The televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.",
      "A YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.",
      "In Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.",
      "If Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.",
      "And with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.",
      "Germany decides to leave history in the past and rebuild its military",
      "How ordinary Poles are preparing for a Russian invasion",
      "'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
      "The message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.",
      "That's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.",
      "The Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"",
      "'The end of an era' - but what now?",
      "Still, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.",
      "China, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "Trump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.",
      "Wittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".",
      "Despite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.",
      "Some also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".",
      "Perhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.",
      "Analysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities.",
      "This is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.",
      "Mr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.",
      "\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.",
      "\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.",
      "\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"",

    "summary": "The US singer says she feels \"bruised\" after weeks of online backlash - what's sparked the change?",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\" after weeks of online backlash.",
      "The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.",
      "Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt \"so connected to love\", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: \"Can we send her back?\"",
      "Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.",
      "It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an \"unhinged and unhealed\" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?",
      "'A pattern of failed reinvention'",
      "The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.",
      "\"Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,\" he says.",
      "For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.",
      "\"That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,\" adds Cragg.",
      "In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.",
      "Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.",
      "The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. \"Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,\" says Cragg.",
      "\"The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,\" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.",
      "It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious \"purposeful pop\" era.",
      "But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.",
      "The 'pop girlie' has changed",
      "Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars \u2013 Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX \u2013 were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.",
      "In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: \"I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.\"",
      "Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.",
      "\"The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,\" argues Cragg.",
      "Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.",
      "But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. \"I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,\" Cragg adds. \"Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,\" he says.",
      "Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.",
      "There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.",
      "Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as \"unbelievable\".",
      "The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.",
      "\"We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,\" it read.",
      "\"Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"",
      "It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Pi\u00f1ata remark acknowledging the backlash.",
      "\"I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,\" Diego tells BBC News.",
      "He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.",
      "But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because \"it's cool now\", he says. \"They don't understand how bad it could affect her.\"",
      "Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.",
      "\"There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,\" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.",
      "So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.",
      "\"I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.\"",

    "summary": "Buddha\u2019s sacred jewels, unearthed in 1898, head to auction at Sotheby\u2019s, raising ethical concerns.",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday, a cache of dazzling jewels linked to the Buddha's mortal remains, which have been hailed as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era, will go under the hammer at Sotheby's in Hong Kong.",
      "For over a century these relics, unearthed from a dusty mound in northern India in 1898, have sat largely unseen, cradled by a private British collection.",
      "Now, as the gems prepare to leave the custody of their keepers, they are stirring not just collectors' appetites but also some unease.",
      "They come from a glittering hoard of nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, topaz, sapphires, and patterned gold sheets, first glimpsed deep inside a brick chamber in present-day Uttar Pradesh in India, near the Buddha's birthplace.",
      "Their discovery \u2013 alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself \u2013 reverberated through the world of archaeology. Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia and worldwide head of Asian Art, believes this is \"among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time\".",
      "Yet as these relics now face the glare of the auction room, experts tell the BBC that a question hangs heavy: can the sale of treasures so intimately woven into India's sacred past be considered ethical?",
      "In 1898, William Claxton Pepp\u00e9, an English estate manager, excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, where the Buddha is believed to have been born. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians agree these relics, intact until then, are the heritage of both the Buddha's Sakya clan descendants and Buddhists worldwide. The bone relics have since been distributed to countries such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where they continue to be venerated.",
      "\"Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?\" wonders Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian. \"And since they aren't, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them?",
      "\"Since the seller is termed the 'custodian', I would like to ask \u2013 custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?\"",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9, great-grandson of William, told the BBC the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the \"fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists\".",
      "Julian King, Sotheby's international specialist and head of sale, Himalayan Art, New York told the BBC the auction house had made a thorough review of the jewels.",
      "\"As is the case with any important items and collectibles that are offered for sale at Sotheby's, we conducted requisite due diligence, including in relation to authenticity and provenance, legality and other considerations in line with our policies and industry standards for artworks and treasures,\" King said.",
      "Ashley Thompson, of Soas University of London, and curator Conan Cheong, both experts in Southeast Asian art, have more questions. In a joint statement they told the BBC: \"Other ethical questions raised by the sale are: should human remains be traded? And who gets to decide what are human remains or not? For many Buddhist practitioners around the world, the gems on sale are part and parcel of the bones and ash.\"",
      "The sale of the relics has also sparked concern among Buddhist leaders.",
      "\"The Buddha teaches us not to take other people's possessions without permission,\" Amal Abeyawardene of London-based British MahaBodhi Society, told the BBC. \"Historical records indicate that the Sakyamuni clan were granted custody of these relics, as the Buddha emanated from their community. Their wish was for these relics to be preserved alongside adornments, such as these gems, so that they may be venerated in perpetuity by the Buddha's followers.\"",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9 has written that the jewels passed from his great-uncle to his cousin, and in 2013 came to him and two other cousins. That's when he began researching their discovery by his great-grandfather.",
      "The Los Angeles-based television director and film editor wrote he had found 1898 newspaper reports - from Reuters to the New York Tribune - announcing the find of Buddha's remains.",
      "\"The colonisation of India by the British had been a source of some cultural shame for me [and continues to be] but, amidst the treasure hunters who hauled their finds back to England, there had also been people focused on the pursuit of knowledge,\" Chris Pepp\u00e9 writes.",
      "He noted his research revealed a lot about his ancestors who he had dismissed as \"prejudiced Victorians from a bygone era\".",
      "\"I learned that Willie Pepp\u00e9's first wife chose to travel around India for her honeymoon and loved the country and its culture. Sadly, she died from an unspecified illness. I learned that my grandmother was outraged at the land laws that applied to Indian women.",
      "\"And I learned that the excavation of the stupa was an attempt by Willie Pepp\u00e9 to provide work for his tenant farmers who had fallen victim to the famine of 1897.\"",
      "He writes his great-grandfather's \"technical diagrams of ramps and pulleys suggest that he was also a trained engineer who couldn't resist a project\".",
      "William Pepp\u00e9 handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.",
      "Only a small \"portion of duplicates\", which he was allowed to keep, remained in the Pepp\u00e9 family, he notes. (Sotheby's notes say Pepp\u00e9 was allowed to keep approximately one-fifth of the discovery.)",
      "Sources told the BBC the auction house considers the \"duplicates\" to be original items considered surplus to those donated, which the \"Indian government permitted Pepp\u00e9 to retain\".",
      "Over the past six years years, the gems have featured in major exhibitions, including one at The Met in 2023. The Pepp\u00e9 family has also launched a website to \"share our research\".",
      "Some scholars argue Buddha relics should never be treated as market commodities.",
      "\"The Sotheby's auction transforms these highly sacred materials into saleable objects, in continuation of acts of colonial violence which extracted them from a stupa and called them 'gems' and 'objects of interest to Europeans', creating a false division with the ash and bone fragments they were consecrated with,\" say Thompson and Cheong.",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9 told the BBC that in all the monasteries he had visited \"no Buddhists regard these as corporeal relics\".",
      "\"A few Buddhist academics\u00a0at western universities have recently offered a convoluted, fact-defying logic whereby they may be regarded as such.\u00a0It's an academic construct that is not shared by Buddhists in general who are familiar with the details of the find,\" he said.",
      "Pepp\u00e9 said the family \"looked into donation [of the relics] to temples and museums and they all presented different problems on closer scrutiny\".",
      "\"An auction seems the fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists and we are confident that Sotheby's will achieve that.\"",
      "Some also point to The Koh-i-Noor, seized by the British East India Company and now part of the Crown Jewels, with many Indians viewing it as stolen. Should the Buddha's jewels be next?",
      "\"Repatriation, I believe, is seldom necessary,\" says Ahuja. \"Such rare and sacred relics that are unique and which define a land's cultural history, however, deserve the government's exceptional attention.\""

    "summary": "Organizers of a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro said the event drew more than 2 million to Copacabana Beach.",
    "story": [
      "Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Saturday's event drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.",
      "Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives.",
      "\"The plan was treated as a 'collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,\" the police said.",
      "Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack \u2014 the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio.",
      "The concert was the biggest show of Gaga's career.",
      "\"Tonight, we're making history,\" Lady Gage told a screaming crowd. \"Thank you for making history with me.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told CBS News the team learned of the alleged threats through media reports.",
      "\"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\" the spokesperson said. \"Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\"",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show just after 10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \"Bloody Mary.\" Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder to shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show, which was funded by the city of Rio in an effort to revitalize the economy. In a recent report, Rio's City Hall said the show should bring in at least 600 million reais, or roughly $106 million.",
      "For Gaga, the performance was also an opportunity to promote her upcoming \"Mayhem Ball\" tour, featuring songs from her latest record MAYHEM. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 when it was released in early March and includes new hits like \"Abracadabra.\"",
      "Lady Gaga also performed a number of older classics at her free show Saturday, including \"Poker Face\" and \"Alejandro,\" switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans \u2014 many of them young \u2014 arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\"Today is the best day of my life,\" said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \"It's surreal to be here.\"",
      "Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year.",
      "The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Year's Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John's Day celebrations in June.",
      "\"It brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season \u2014 filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\" said Osmar Lima, the city's secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall's tourism department last month.",
      "Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028.",
      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song \"LoveGame\" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",
      "More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio's City Hall said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, traveled from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",
      "\"I've been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,\" said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga's outlandish costumes over the years.",
      "For her, the mega-star represents \"total freedom of expression \u2014 being who one wants without shame.\"",
      "Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna's show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state's security plan included 3,300 members of the military, 1,500 police officers and 400 firefighters.",
      "Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues.",
      "Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait.",
      "\"She's the best artist in the world,\" the 25-year-old said, as chants of \"Gaga, I love you\" in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him.",

    "summary": "The actor-playwright received two Tony nominations for the over-the-top comedy about Mary Todd Lincoln and her secret passion of becoming a cabaret star, while her husband, Abe, is trying to win the Civil War.",
    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 09:55:56 -0400",
    "summary": "When Alex Matisse founded East Fork Pottery, in Asheville, N.C., he didn't want to use the name of his great-grandfather, artist Henri Matisse. But after business took off, Alex decided it was time \u2013 and now graces his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear.",
    "story": [
      "As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself.\u00a0 \"When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,\" he said. \"We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon.\"",
      "Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, \"I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",
      "When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA \u2013 because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse.",
      "I asked, \"What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?\"",
      "\"He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,\" Alex replied.",
      "It was a famous last name he ran away from for years.\u00a0 \"I had a very grumpy relationship with it,\" he laughed. \"It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake.\"",
      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

The dress code of the 2025 Met Gala \u2014 typically related to the exhibit's theme \u2014 is \"Tailored for You,\" calling for a focus on suiting and menswear, according to the Met.

      "Bad Bunny wore Margiela and Jennifer Lopez wore a Schiaparelli design. Both co-chaired the event with Wintour, who wore a Loewe custom floor-length jacket adorned in feathers that formed tulip bouquets. But Zendaya, another gala co-chair, stole the night by walking the carpet twice. She first wore Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano before changing quickly and closing out the most public part of the night, the strut into the event at the steps of the Met, in a 1996 black gown from John Galliano's Givenchy era, which she paired with a flower bouquet Alexander McQueen head piece designed by Philip Treacy.",
      "2023 Met Gala theme: \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\"",
      "The Met Gala honored the late designer Karl Lagerfeld in 2023 with a night of references to his style and his immense influence in the fashion world. Some wore Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, Fendi, Balmain and Chlo\u00e9, while others twisted his unique way of dressing, which combined black, white and leather for his daily wear, and later in life inspired the creative behind his eponymous label. There were also plenty of cat odes at the gala, a tribute to Lagerfeld's beloved feline friend Choupette,",
      "2022 Met Gala theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\"",
      "The second installment of a two-part exhibition on fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" celebrated two centuries of American identity through fashion's eyes. \"Gilded Glamour\" graced the gala's red carpet and American history references were prevalent.",
      "The most recognized garment belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The nude, form-fitting number shined on the style icon while she serenaded then-president John F. Kennedy for his birthday in 1962. Kim Kardashian wore the dress after entering a deal with the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum to bring the garment out of its display. The uproar was immediate, as some alleged possible damage to the dress. Ripley's was forced to respond\u00a0denying the heated claims.",
      "2021 Met Gala theme: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\"",
      "The first of two parts, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" wove together identities of the ever-changing U.S. through time, exploring the emotions behind the country's evolving culture.

      "After a pause for the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, social hesitance was still evident and masks were incorporated into some of the night's designs. Of note, Billie Eilish wore an Oscar De La Renta dress for a cause, calling for the storied house to end its ties to fur.",
      "2019 Met Gala theme: \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\"",
      "Guests brought their imagination to the pink carpet for the 2019 \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" gala rendition. Gender-bending was evident\u00a0and many looks turned heads, like Jared Leto's interpretation of Alessandro Michele's world of Gucci. Lady Gaga's iconic Brandon Maxwell looks told a story of style with each step the singer took outside of the Met. Framed around Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp,'\" the gala brought to life the whimsical and effervescent nature of fashion.",
      "2018 Met Gala theme: \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"",
      "The 2018 Met Gala theme drew inspiration from Catholicism. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" explored religious iconography and the influence of medieval art in fashion. Guests brought to life looks that referenced papal garments and displayed biblical artifacts like crosses, angel wings and halos. The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",

      "Zendaya's first and second look, 2024 Met Gala",
      "Zendaya has become a favorite at the Met Gala, and last year she was a co-chair, alongside Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and, of course, Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. The night's theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Fashion Reawakened,\" and the dress code was \"Garden of Time.\"",
      "The \"Dune\" and \"Euphoria\" star opened the evening in an ocean blue gown by Maison Margiela with fitted a corset and layers of metallic fabric, styled with a feather headpiece and smokey makeup.",
      "Then hours later, she made a surprise return on the red carpet with a second look. She appeared in a never-before-worn Givenchy couture gown from the 1996 collection -- the year she was born -- along with a vintage Alexander McQueen hat adorned with a bouquet of roses.",
      "\"When it comes to the Met carpet, Zendaya is all about keeping us guessing-but one thing is for certain: She will always turn heads. Clearly, she did it again tonight,\" Vogue's Senior Fashion and Style Writer Christian Allaire wrote of her back-to-back looks.",

      "He wore a navy smoking jacket with red and white stitching, topped with a large beret and gold sunglasses.",
      "The Puerto Rican artist arrived on the red carpet carrying a floral bouquet made from the same fabric as his jacket. The blooms represented the flor de maga -- the national flower of Puerto Rico -- along with roses and the flax plant that Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale.",
      "His backless, all-white look from 2023, honoring\u00a0late designer Karl Lagerfeld, also gets an honorable mention on the list.",
      "Tyla's sand dress, 2024 Met Gala",

      "The Balmain   design was made up of three colors of sand and crystal studs.",
      "\"We were looking to do something creative, something completely different for my first Met Gala,\" the singer and songwriter told Vogue ahead of the event. \"So when Balmain showed me the idea and sketch, I just knew it was perfect. The idea was crazy, and I loved it.\"",
      "She also carried an hourglass clutch in a nod to \"the sands of time.\"",
      "Michaela Coel dripping in gold, 2023 Met Gala",
      "Michaela Coel was a co-chair for the 2023 Met Gala and she dazzled in a floor-length gown by Schiaparelli that was covered in crystals, accompanied by a large diamond necklace and chunky gold earrings.",
      "The \"I May Destroy You\" creator's skin was glowing, with the help of makeup artist Bernicia Boateng, who told Vogue she \"wanted her skin to beam and almost speak for her.\"",
      "\"Anna [Wintour] has been a real champion of me, she put me on the cover of American Vogue,\" Coel said in a behind-the-scenes interview as she got ready for the gala. \"She said that I am not afraid to be myself... and that's why she asked me to co-chair.\"",
      "Her fellow co-chairs included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa.",
      "Doja Cat goes full cat, 2023 Met Gala",
      "Love it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette.",
      "Doja Cat wore an Oscar de la Renta gown with cat ears on the hood and a large diamond that dangled in front of her forehead. To complete her cat transformation, her makeup featured black cat eyeliner and made her nose look more cat-like.",
      "The Grammy winner famously stayed in character for her red carpet interview, answering every question with \"meow.\"",
      "Choupette, who Lagerfeld reportedly received as a gift from French model Baptiste Giabiconi, has her own Instagram account with more than a quarter million followers.",
      "Blake Lively's NYC inspired gown, 2022 Met Gala",
      "Blake Lively has been gracing the Met Gala for more than a decade, and she ramped up the drama in recent years. She wore a stunning Atelier  Versace gown for the 2022 Met Gala, drawing inspiration from New York City landmarks to fit the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\"",
      "Lively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Husband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren.",
      "Lively also made the best-dressed list with another Versace gown at the 2018 Met Gala in a jeweled bodice and detailed embroidery, paired with a halo headpiece.",

      "Speaking of epic entrances, Lil Nas X put on a show at the 2021 Met Gala with three distinct looks from Donatella Versace.",
      "He started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit.",
      "The fashion house called it a \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\"",
      "The artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before.",
      "Iman's latest iconic look, 2021 Met Gala",
      "Nobody does it quite like Iman. The supermodel has worn so many iconic looks over the years, but the 2021 Met Gala will go down as one of her best.",
      "Her outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers.",
      "Reed told Vogue they were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\"",
      "Iman first attended the Met Gala in 1981 with Calvin Klein and later appeared alongside her husband and fellow fashion icon, David Bowie.",
      "Maluma's red leather suit, 2021 Met Gala",
      "Maluma was the first reggaet\u00f3n artist to attend the Met Gala when he made his debut in 2019 and he continues to push the envelope.",
      "He joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories.",
      "\"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" Maluma told Vogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\"",
      "He also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones.",
      "Zendaya's light-up Cinderella look, 2019 Met Gala",
      "First, there was Joan of Arc in 2018. Then, her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird 2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"",
      "With the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd.",
      "Roach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles.",
      "As for last year's looks, he said Zendaya wasn't even fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event.",
      "\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" he told The New York Times in an interview ahead of time. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\"",
      "Time to work their Met Gala magic once again.",

      "Her sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, wore coordinated sheer Versace dresses embellished with bright orange and purple feathers, respectively. Kylie was joined by her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Scott.",
      "And of course it wouldn't be a Kardashian photo-op without mom, Kris Jenner. She had on a navy blue Tommy Hilfiger jumpsuit with oversized gray shoulders, plus a platinum blonde wig that was reportedly a last-minute suggestion from Kylie.",
      "The Kardashian sisters have been known for some hit-or-miss looks over the years, including Kim's infamous \"black-out\" look in 2021.",
      "Billy Porter goes for gold, 2019 Met Gala",
      "Oh Billy Porter, where to begin. His 2019 Met Gala look was one for the ages.",
      "Porter entered the event lounging on a platform carried by six shirtless men. He then climbed down to spread a pair of giant, golden wings.",
      "In a behind-the-scenes interview before the big reveal, he told Vogue that \"Camp\" is often discounted or \"thought of as cheesy,\" but, \"when it's done properly, it's one of the highest forms of fashion and art.\"",
      "Porter enlisted New York City-based brand The Blonds to design the Ancient Egypt-inspired look.",
      "\"Given the massive collection of Egyptian art The Met has, it was also our way to pay respect to that,\" he said.",
      "Lady Gaga's many looks, 2019 Met Gala",
      "Before Lil Nas X and Blake Lively pulled off multiple outfits, Lady Gaga was the original shapeshifter at the 2019 Met Gala. It was almost like the star was born to take on the theme.",
      "Lady Gaga rocked four different looks all designed by her friend, Brandon Maxwell. First, she arrived in a massive pink dress with a 25-foot train and five dancers carrying umbrellas. As she entered The Met steps, her team unzipped the cape to reveal another black gown underneath.",
      "Then she unveiled another pink dress paired with large black sunglasses, appearing to apply makeup and pose for selfies. And finally, she shed that dress and stripped down to a black bra, panties, stockings and boots.",

      "Queen Bey's younger sister also made the list for the 2015 Met Gala with a head-scratching mini dress.",

      "Andre Leon Talley, a red carpet staple, 2015 Met Gala",

      "During her more than three decades of recording, singer-songwriter-guitarist Jill Sobule (Jan. 16, 1959-May 1, 2025) released more than a dozen albums, EPs and compilations that addressed such complex subject matter as the death penalty, anorexia, the French Resistance, teen mental health, religion, and LGBTQ+ issues. Her 1995 song \"I Kissed A Girl\" was the first openly-gay-themed song to make it into the Billboard Top 20 despite being banned by many Southern radio stations.",
      "Other hits included \"Too Cool to Fall in Love,\" \"Supermodel\" (from the movie \"Clueless\"), and \"Bitter.\"",
      "Born in Denver, Sobule was praised for her witty and poignant writing, which first attracted attention with her 1990 album, \"Things Here Are Different.\" After two record companies dropped her and two indie labels she was tied to went bankrupt, Sobule turned to crowdfunding, with a website, jillsnextrecord.com, to raise $75,000. \"I think I got it within six weeks,\" Sobule told \"CBS Evening News.\" In addition to small dollar gifts, one donor wrote in saying, \"'I'm really not a fan of your music, but I think this is a great new model, so I'm giving you $50.'\" The resulting album, \"California Years,\" was released in 2009. She turned to crowdsourcing again for the 2018 album \"Nostalgia Kills.\"",
      "Sobule performed with such artists as Neil Young, Melissa Etheridge, Billy Bragg, Warren Zevon and Cyndi Lauper; appeared with \"SNL\" comedian Julia Sweeney in a stage show, \"Jill and Julia\"; and played herself performing a song on \"The Simpsons.\" She also starred in \"F*CK7thGrade,\" a 2022 autobiographical off-Broadway show described as \"a queer musical memoir\" that was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.",
      "Last month, in an interview with Cincy Music, Sobule was asked about the changes she has seen in the recording business during her career. \"The demise of the music industry as we once knew it, hasn't been great,\" she said. \"Thinking of the sad-ass checks from Spotify. But it has also made one become creative in other endeavors. For example, musical theater. I do tell my theater pals that I have moved on from the music industry, as I've been told off-Broadway theater is so lucrative. They just laugh.\""

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, her agent Mike Eisenstadt said in a statement. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \"She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\"",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",

      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \"Laugh-In\" when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\"I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\" he wrote in his 2023 memoir \"Still Laughing: A Life in Comedy.\" \"I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\"",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \"Laugh-In,\" her most frequent target was Arte Johnson's dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\"Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \"So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who's been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused.

      "Buzzi remained friends through the years with \"Laugh-In\" co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley.",
      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor.

      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",

      "She got her national television break on \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician's assistant to Dom DeLuise's character Dominic the Great.",

      "She appeared in Ball's last comedy series, \"Life With Lucy.\"",
      "Buzzi guested in music videos with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, the B-52's and the Presidents of the United States of America.",
      "She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including \"Pound Puppies,\" \"Berenstain Bears,\" \"The Smurfs\" and \"The Angry Beavers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nearly all of the remaining staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were laid off Friday, multiple officials and laid-off employees told CBS News, gutting programs ranging from approvals of new safety equipment to firefighter health.",
      "Much of the work at NIOSH, an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had already stalled after an initial round of layoffs on April 1 at the agency ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "New requests for investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards had already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan to help Texas schools curb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs.",
      "NIOSH was started in 1970 as part of the same law that created another federal agency called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. In addition to its own voluntary recommendations for employers, NIOSH produces research to inform OSHA's regulations and enforcement.",
      "NIOSH employees receiving layoff notices late Friday included some workers for the World Trade Center Health Program, miner safety, and firefighter health programs. Some workers for those programs had been asked to temporarily return to work for another month or two, after pleas from members of Congress.",
      "Among the layoffs to NIOSH's World Trade Center Health Program were nurses and scientists, two CDC officials said. Staff dealing with enrollment, member services and other administrative duties were also cut.",
      "Layoff notices received by workers Friday were almost identical to those received in the initial round of Kennedy's cuts, which said that their duties \"have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.\"",
      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",
      "The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said.",
      "Stalled work includes changes needed to meet new standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association for this year. No equipment is currently certified to meet those standards, nor has the agency been able to issue refunds to application fees paid for by manufacturers.",
      "Efforts to spot and warn of counterfeit personal protective equipment was also halted due to the layoffs, officials said.",
      "\"Millions of workers across various sectors - including healthcare, construction, and emergency services - depend on NIOSH-approved respirators. Without these approvals, their safety is compromised, leading to potential illness, injury, or even death,\" laid-off employees wrote in a letter shared with CBS News.",
      "HHS responds to NIOSH layoffs",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday, asking what would happen to the agency's work now that most of its teams had been eliminated. The department had previously said that NIOSH would be absorbed into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "In\u00a0a post Saturday on X, the department said that firefighter programs were still a top priority and that as \"the agency continues to streamline operations, the essential services provided by NIOSH will remain fully intact and uninterrupted.\"",
      "The department also claimed no CDC employees had been terminated on Friday and only a \"required notice was sent to NIOSH employees, following the agreed-upon standard process with the union.\"",
      "Laid-off NIOSH workers told CBS News that the department's post was misleading, since workers represented by unions were still on the job until Friday, when they received letters from HHS informing them of the layoffs and that they would be locked out of the agency's buildings.",
      "That capped a process which started\u00a0in late March, after unions received a notice saying that most NIOSH employees could be cut by the end of June. In the past, unions could use that time to negotiate with the department, allowing employees to continue to work during talks that might mitigate or avoid a \"reduction in force\" of their members.",
      "However, unions were unable to initiate negotiations with Kennedy's department to head off the layoff notices Friday.\u00a0 An executive order issued by President Trump ended collective bargaining with unions representing the CDC and some other agencies, which is now being challenged in court.",

      "There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate data for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",
      "Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately.",
      "\"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\" Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.",
      "\"All of this to say, trends in underlying causes of death will reflect awareness of diabetes and coding practices; It is hard to know what role these play in these data,\" Selvin said.",

      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve COVID-19 vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.",
      "\"We're taking a look. I can't comment on any particular application. As you know, we have a bunch of applications for those booster shots,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.",
      "Makary said many health care workers did not get the last round of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, calling it \"a bit of a public trust problem.\"",
      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also now weighing whether to significantly narrow its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",
      "Multiple companies are now also being asked \"to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with,\" Makary told CBS News.",
      "\"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them,\" he said.",
      "He also praised his special assistant, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg, when asked what role she played in the agency's evaluation of Novavax's application.",
      "\"Dr. H\u00f8eg is an amazing M.D.-Ph.D. who has joined my staff as a special assistant to the commissioner. And she is involved in reviewing data sets at the agency. And I'm really excited to have her in the process,\" Makary said.",
      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",
      "Former FDA officials have criticized the agency's new political leadership for their intervention in vaccine approvals, a process which is usually entrusted to career scientific officials.",
      "In a commentary\u00a0published this week, former officials Phil Krause and Luciana Borio called on the FDA to \"stick to its normal processes.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 16:24:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Cheaper goods from China are no longer exempt from import duties, which could sharply raise prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "Temu, for one, announced a dramatic shift to its business model. \"All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarwab, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",

      "\"The rollback of the de minimis exemption for tariffed goods is poised to hit consumers' wallets,\" PwC consumer markets industry leader Ali Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and the architect of ChatGPT, is behind a venture that wants to solve a modern-day problem: proving you're human amidst a proliferation of bots and artificial intelligence.",
      "The startup, called World (formerly Worldcoin), is launching in the U.S. with the distribution of 20,000 tech devices called Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior.",
      "The device, which looks like something out of \"Black Mirror,\" may seem ironic coming from Altman, given that its purpose is to help people stand out from the very same types of technology he helped develop. But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people.",
      "The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\"",
      "U.S. rollout follows international debut",
      "World isn't exactly new, as it debuted outside the U.S. in 2023 and has already sparked privacy backlash, with Kenya's government shutting down the service, according to the Associated Press. Other jurisdictions followed suit, including Hong Kong and Spain.",
      "\"I will say that upon the launch in 2023 there was a lot of noise about this,\" Brukhman said. \"But a lot of noise came from the lack of understanding about the Orb and how it works.\"",
      "The Orb doesn't store any biometric data, he added. The device takes photos to ensure a person is human, but then stores that info on the user's device, not in the Orb, according to World's website.",
      "World also has a link to cryptocurrencies, as the Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The time is right for a rollout in the U.S., Brukhman said, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under Trump administration. President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, is working on a \"crypto strategic reserve\" for the nation.",
      "The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco, as well as at gaming retailer Razer, with the idea that people can go to physical locations to get themselves verified as human.",
      "\"It takes a founder of the brand and acumen of a Sam Altman to really do digital identity,\" Brukhman said. The U.S. rollout \"will massively bolster the adoption of registered users on the network.\"",

The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\"This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy that you have heard and seen such action from our administration with DOGE to be able to deal with the bureaucracy that we believe has grown up over many years to be entrenched against the interests of the American people,\" the senior OMB official told reporters on a conference call Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "The president's proposed budget would put all discretionary spending at $1.7 trillion, down from $1.83 trillion in the current fiscal year, and increase defense spending by 13%, the official said. The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said.",

      "The S&P 500 was up 90 points, or 1.6%, as of 2:07 p.m. EST, putting the index on track for a ninth straight day of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 598 points, or 1.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.8%.",
      "The gains were broad. Technology stocks were among the companies doing the heaviest lifting. Microsoft surged 2.6% and Nvidia rose 2.1%. Banks and other financial companies also made solid gains. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.3% and Visa jumped 1.8%.",
      "Employers added 177,000 jobs in April. That marks a slowdown in hiring from March, but still topped analyst forecasts",
      "The latest job figures don't yet reflect the effects on the economy of President Trump's across-the-board tariffs against America's trading partners. Still, the latest payroll gains allay concerns about an imminent recession, according to some analysts.",
      "\"There is nothing to complain about here,\" Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics said in a research note. \"You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures.\"",
      "The release on Wednesday of ADP's employment numbers for April, showed private employers added 62,000 jobs for the month, far fewer than the 134,000 jobs that had been forecast by economists, according to FactSet. Also, the U.S. economy\u00a0shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year, according to\u00a0GDP data\u00a0from the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Together, the two reports raised alarm bells among analysts.",

However, that engine could stall if the labor market deteriorates, so investors should keep a close on jobless claims,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said in a report.",
      "\"The April jobs report may reassure investors that the labor market is holding up, giving them more confidence that the economy can hold up too,\" he added.",
      "Ongoing tariff fears",
      "The job market is being closely watched for signs of stress amid trade war tensions. Economists are worried about the impact that stiff new U.S. tariffs on imports from China and other key trading partners will boost inflation, reduce corporate profits and slow broader economic growth.",
      "The current round of tariffs and the on-again-off-again nature of Mr. Trump's policy has hindered planning for businesses and consumers. Companies have been cutting and withdrawing financial forecasts because of the uncertainty over how much tariffs will cost them and how much they will squeeze consumers and sap spending.",
      "Hopes remain that Mr. Trump will roll back some of his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries. China has been a key target, with tariffs of 145%. Its Commerce Ministry said Beijing is evaluating overtures from the U.S. regarding the tariffs.",
      "In a statement from China's Commerce Ministry on Friday, an unnamed ministry spokesperson was cited as saying that Beijing had taken note of various statements by senior U.S. officials indicating a willingness to negotiate over tariffs.",
      "\"At the same time, the U.S. has recently taken the initiative to convey information to the Chinese side on a number of occasions through relevant parties, hoping to talk with the Chinese side. In this regard, the Chinese side is making an assessment,\" the statement read, with global markets rising soon after.",
      "Investors had a relatively quiet day of earnings reports following a busy week. Exxon Mobil fell 0.3% after reporting its lowest first-quarter profit in years. Rival Chevron rose 0.3% after it also reported its smallest first-quarter profit in years.",
      "Falling crude oil prices have weighed on the sector. Crude oil prices in the U.S. are down about 18% for the year. They fell below $60 per barrel this week, which is a level at which many producers can no longer turn a profit.",

      "Job growth was stronger than expected in April, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly employment report. Payroll gains exceeded economist forecasts of 135,000 last month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, matching forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The data suggests the labor market remains healthy despite rising concerns about how the Trump administration's tariff policies will impact economic activity.",
      "Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a research note that the stronger-than-expected pace of job-creation last month shows the risks of a recession are low, at least for now.",
      "\"There is nothing to complain about here. You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures,\" he said, while noting that tariffs are likely to take a toll on hiring in the months to come.\"We are waiting for layoffs to begin and for claims and unemployment to rise,\" he added. \"This month's payrolls figure was a lot better than expected, but the strong trend in employment does not last in our forecast.\"",
      "Health care companies, along with the transportation and warehousing sector, saw the largest gains in employment last month, adding 51,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively.",
      "The jump in transportation and warehousing jobs \u2014 more than double its 12-month average of 12,000 \u2014 was notable. Cory Stahle, an economist from Indeed Hiring Lab economist, thinks that could indicate companies are adding to their inventories ahead of tariffs taking effect and boosting their costs.",
      "Federal employment declined by 9,000, up from 4,000 in March. Government layoffs have risen in recent months because of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump administration touts as a cost-saving effort.",
      "\"April may have been the last month when we didn't see the aggregate impact of trade war 2.0, DOGE job cuts and tight immigration policy. But look closely enough and there are hints, like the slight decline in manufacturing payrolls and another drop in federal government jobs,\" Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Although the latest employment numbers suggest a steady job market, government data this week showed that more Americans are filing for unemployment benefits as layoffs mount. Jobless claims increased 18,000 to 241,000 for the week ending April 26, the highest level since mid-February, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"Continued claims are more volatile week to week, but remain elevated, signaling that workers who lose their job are facing challenges in finding new employment,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "In another important snapshot of the economy this week, the nation's gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first three months of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The main reason for the sharp decline was the rush by consumers and businesses to order imported goods ahead of tariffs taking effect (Imports reduce GDP, while exports increase it.)",
      "What experts are saying",
      "Experts say the economy has proved resilient, with steady hiring despite concern over the Trump administration's trade policies. A recession appears unlikely for now, although economists note it could take several months for tariff-induced instability to appear in the government's monthly job numbers.",
      "\"Some of the increase in employment in April... reflects a burst of pre-tariff activity, which will unravel over the next couple months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Soft data like consumer confidence survey,\u00a0polling\u00a0and jobless claims show signs of economic weakness.",
      "The solid job gains in April also increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate steady when policy makers meet next week on May 6-7, experts say.",
      "\"The healthy 177,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in April and unchanged unemployment rate will reassure the Fed that there is no need to be hasty in lowering interest rates when it meets next week,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report.",

But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",

He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",

      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",

The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

      "In a letter\u00a0sent to the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, Suzanne Clark, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, asks for an \"automatic exclusion\" from new tariffs for U.S. small businesses that import goods from abroad. Small businesses do not have the margin or capital reserves to survive an increase in tariffs, Clark wrote in the letter.",
      "\"The Chamber requests the administration take immediate action to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,\" she wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have\u00a0raised the chances\u00a0of a recession over the next 12 months, according to economists. Still, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0said\u00a0in April it does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025.",
      "Clark added that tariffs could cause \"irreparable harm\" to the small business community if trade deals are not reached soon. Products from most countries are subject a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.",
      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs. One business owner who recently spoke to\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch\u00a0said she fears her company may have to close up shop for good.",
      "Less room to maneuver",
      "If tariffs persist, small business owners could end up passing on the cost to customers in the form of higher prices, as large corporations such as Amazon, Temu and Shein have done in recent weeks.",
      "However, unlike huge corporations, any declines in consumer spending as a result of higher prices could spell financial disaster for many small businesses, which typically operate with tight margins. Roughly 43% of small business owners said their companies would not survive if they fell short on revenue for three to four months, according to a recent TD Bank survey.",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks is rethinking the role of \"innovation\" in running a coffee chain.",
      "After rolling out a new system of technical enhancements to streamline cold food and drink orders, the company made an abrupt U-turn this week and said it would halt use of its automated equipment and restore the human touch by bringing more baristas on board.",
      "The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that has lost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion.",
      "In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week.",
      "\"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said.",
      "What is the Siren system?",
      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",

      "The Journal's report comes after Tesla's first-quarter sales and profit\u00a0took a hit amid a backlash from some consumers about Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-tax-cut-below-200000-income-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 08:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says steep tariffs on U.S. imports will lead to lower taxes for Americans. Is he right?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump describes his administration's sweeping new tariffs on other countries as a tool for accomplishing a range of key economic goals, including reviving U.S. manufacturing. Recently, he's been highlighting another aim: lowering, or even eliminating, individual income taxes for most Americans.",
      "\"When Tariffs cut in, many people's Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" he wrote Sunday on Truth Social, his social media app.",
      "Tariffs are already kicking in, with businesses around the country facing import duties of 145% or more on imports from China and tariffs of 10% on goods shipped from almost every other nation. Many Americans say they disapprove of these import duties, which are typically passed onto consumers through higher prices, and are bracing for higher inflation as the costs trickle through the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments also point to his earlier assertions that higher tariffs could raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenue in the next year or so. On Sunday, before boarding Air Force One to return from Pope Francis' funeral, Mr. Trump asserted that the revenue raised by his tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax\" in the U.S.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether the Trump administration is developing a proposal to cut taxes for most Americans.",
      "What's the link between tariffs and taxes?",
      "Currently, there is no tax bill in Congress \u2014 the arm of government with the authority to change the tax code \u2014 that would eliminate federal income taxes for people earning $200,000 or less. Even so, the House is working on a reconciliation bill that would extend Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add a few new reductions promised by the president on the campaign trail, such as eliminating taxes on employee tips.",
      "If passed, that bill would mean individuals would continue to pay the same tax rates they've paid since Mr. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took effect beginning for the 2018 tax year, with\u00a0individual tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%, depending on a person's income. And if the legislation is enacted, notably, most Americans would see no difference in their federal income tax rate.",
      "\"There is no real connection\" between Mr. Trump's tariffs and lower taxes, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues. \"He has the authority to impose higher tariffs, and he's done that. But he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cut income taxes \u2014 that's done by Congress.\"",
      "There is \"zero chance\" that Congress would eliminate income taxes for a large swath of the U.S. population because the new tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace the $2.4 trillion in income taxes\u00a0paid by American households each year, she added.",
      "Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 or twice the current rate under Mr. Trump \u2014 the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "Why tariffs can't replace income taxes",
      "Even the notion of eliminating income taxes for people earning less than $200,000 doesn't add up, York said. Here's why: Mr. Trump's tariffs could raise about $170 billion in revenue this year, while wiping out individual taxes for people earning less than $200,000 would forego $700 billion in tax revenue this year, she estimated.",
      "\"You would need tariffs multiple times higher than what we have now\" to generate the revenue to make up for the gap in lost taxes, York said. Making the math work is \"an impossibility,\" she added.",
      "Yet hiking taxes even more aggressively would heighten the risks of a U.S. recession, which would cause job losses, inhibit consumer spending, suppress business investment and further roil financial markets \u2014 all developments that reduce the government's tax receipts.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim about tariffs lowering taxes amounts to \"an argument that says, 'If Americans pay more out of their left pocket, the government will be able to put more in their right pocket,'\" said Joe Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, another think tank focused on taxes.",
      "\"Even if you make the math work, it's really replacing one form of tax with another \u2014 and the other important point here is these taxes have very different distributional effects across income types,\" he added.",
      "Translation: Tariffs take a bigger bite out of low- and middle-income Americans' budgets because they spend a larger share of their incomes on basics like food and household goods than compared with high-income Americans. A typical low-income household is likely to see their disposable income fall by 5.5% under Mr. Trump's tariffs, compared with 1.9% for the highest-earning families, according to a March 31\u00a0estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "But faced with higher prices for consumer goods, many households would cut back on spending, adding to the challenges of relying on tariffs to raise enough revenue to replace income taxes, experts say.",
      "Dueling goals",
      "Mr. Trump's move lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1943\u00a0reflects conflicting aims, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For instance, the president has said he wants to use tariffs to secure better trade deals with other nations. Yet reaching new trade pacts with lower tariff rates would undercut the president's goal of relying on import duties to replace the federal income tax.",
      "Mr. Trump's back-and-forth on his tariffs, including temporarily rolling back some import fees and creating exclusions for certain products, also undermines the administration's ability to generate a new source of federal revenue, Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "\"If you are tariffs on, tariffs off, because of these negotiations that are supposedly going on, you're not raising much revenue, or protecting industry or getting new investment the United States because of all the uncertainty,\" Lincicome said.",
      "By dangling the prospect of a tax cut, Mr. Trump may be seeking to convince Americans to bear the brunt of the tariffs' impact, which economists say could slow U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"Americans are about to find out really fast that this is a tax on us,\" York noted. \"It will hurt our trading partners, too, but it is a tax that in large part falls on American businesses and American workers.\"",

    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "\"I have to respond by saying again, and I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "His comments come as he discussed the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the El Salvadoran native who is married to a U.S. citizen and was living in Maryland before the Trump administration\u00a0mistakenly deported him in March. Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted in a court filing that the deportation of the Baltimore father was an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight.\"",

      "When asked about the delay in returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and whether he's defying the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump told NBC that Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department had interpreted the court's 9-0 decision differently.",

      "President Nayib Bukele has said he won't return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. During his visit to the White House last month, Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said, \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said in the interview that aired Sunday that there's a possibility that the Department of Justice will go back to the Supreme Court and ask the justices to clarify their order to the administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return.

      "President Trump said Sunday he is directing his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on an island near San Francisco, California.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Mr. Trump wrote that, \"For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm.

      "Mr. Trump's social media post comes as he has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without due process. Mr. Trump has also talked about wanting to send American citizens there and to other foreign prisons.",
      "Mr. Trump, returning to the White House on Sunday night, told reporters he came up with the idea because of frustrations with \"radicalized judges\" who have insisted those being deported receive due process.",
      "What was Alcatraz prison?",
      "Alcatraz prison, located on Alcatraz Island located just over a mile north of San Francisco, was a maximum-security, minimum-privilege prison opened in 1934 to deal with the \"most incorrigible inmates in federal prisons,\" the Bureau of Prisons says.",
      "It was also to \"show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant crime of the 1920s and 1930s,\" the Bureau said on its website.",
      "Well-known criminals such as Al Capone, George \"Machine-Gun\" Kelly, Alvin Karpis (the first \"Public Enemy No. 1) and Arthur \"Doc\" Barker did time in Alcatraz, according to the BOP. However, most of the prisoners were not infamous gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules and regulations of other federal institutions.",
      "Alcatraz had a capacity of 336 prisoners, though the average population was only about 260 to 275 at any given time.",
      "Over the 29 years that it operated, 36 men were involved in 14 separate escape attempts. Of these, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed and two drowned.",
      "It closed on March 21, 1963, because the prison was too expensive to continue to operate, the BOP said.",
      "After it closed, it was basically abandoned. In 1969, a group of Native American Indians occupied Alcatraz for 18 months, claiming it as Indian land.",
      "Can people visit Alcatraz?",
      "After its closure, the prison was often portrayed as \"America's Devil's Island\" in books and movies, including \"The Rock\" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" starring Clint Eastwood.",
      "In 1972, Congress created the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the island where Alcatraz sits on was included as part of a new National Park Service site. The island opened to tourists in the fall of 1973 and has become one of the most popular National Park Service sites.",

      "A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX.",
      "Starbase is the facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program that is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars.",
      "Early results look favorable",
      "Musk first floated the idea of Starbase in 2021, and approval of the new city was all but certain. Of the 283 eligible voters in the area, most are believed to be Starbase workers.",
      "The unofficial results on election night show 212 votes for the City of Starbase incorporation, or 100%, with Bobby Peden elected as mayor with 100% of the votes.",
      "The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaire's popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.",
      "SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area.",
      "Musk's personal stake in the outcome",
      "But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.",
      "Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new town's mayor and city council.",
      "All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year.",
      "The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes.",
      "SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "\"We need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,\" Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot.",
      "The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as \"the provisions of schooling and medical care\" for those living on the property.",
      "Increased launch activity and beach closures",
      "SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.",

    "summary": "PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Sunday that \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" after President Trump last week ordered a cut off to federal funding to PBS and NPR.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Sunday that \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" after President Trump issued an executive order last week aimed at cutting federal funding to the two major public broadcasting systems \u2014 PBS and NPR.",
      "\"This is different. They're coming after us on many different ways,\" Kerger said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. The executive order dictates that the government \"shall cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, consistent with my Administration's policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.\"",
      "Kerger said it's one of a number of avenues where the administration is \"coming after us,\" including with a possible rescission of already appropriated funds, and an effort to challenge sponsorships from corporations through the Federal Communications Commission, among other things.",
      "\"Obviously we're going to be pushing back very hard, because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations, across the country,\" Kerger said.",
      "Kerger said PBS gets 15% of its funding from the federal government, but said that figure is an aggregate number, with some stations in small communities receiving up to 40% or 50% of their funding from the government. For them, she said \"it's existential,\" adding \"that's what's at risk if this funding goes away.\"",
      "Among the funding that Kerger said she expects to be impacted is funding from the Department of Education, which she said has supported the creation of children's programming and the research behind its educational components. Kerger said the programming was created because not all children have access to formal pre-kindergarten.",
      "\"That was the idea with Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers, and everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool,\" Kerger said. \"That's what's at risk.\"",
      "NPR CEO Katherine Maher also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and said \"we're looking at whatever options are available to us\" to challenge the executive order. Maher echoed that the \"immediate damage is to local stations,\" while noting that other scenarios, like a clawback of already appropriated funds, or if stations were no longer able to participate in their membership dues, would be \"damaging.\"",
      "\"The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities,\" Maher said, noting that there are 246 stations throughout the country, and for some Americans, they provide the sole local source of news.",
      "The executive order says \"Americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage,\" while arguing that government funding for news media is \"not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\" The order claims that neither PBS nor NPR present \"a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\"",
      "Maher, who noted that she doesn't personally make editorial decisions, said in response to the suggestion that NPR is not fair and non-partisan that \"I think our newsroom would really take issue with that.\"",
      "\"We have been on air for more than 50 years. We have been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, overseas,\" Maher said. \"We have an extraordinary Washington desk, and our people report straight down the line, and I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting.\"",

And we certainly are seeing, I think, some reaction now in China also that means that the president's goal is that these nations, that \u2013 of which he's putting tariffs on the table and tariffs, which are a punishment for having behaved poorly, taking advantage of the United States economically, will come to the table and negotiate better economic deals than the United States has been experiencing.",
      "Those deals are beginning to be offered. The White House is beginning to negotiate those. China is beginning to signal that they're willing to come to the table. So, even though the president is making those statements, at the same time, we're seeing that the president taking that step of saying we want a better economic deal is beginning to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in the meantime, China said it may restrict exports of materials used by General Dynamics, which makes tanks, including in your state of Ohio. Are you concerned that the trade war won't just impact people's purchasing of toys, but preparedness, tanks, and military readiness?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think we're all concerned of the effects on the supply chain. And certainly we have got to make certain that this works through the entire processes and that we are concerned on the effects of the economy.",
      "I think the president's going to be looking at that. Congress is going to be looking at that. But the real concern here is that we do have to look long term as to how this protects our overall economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Beijing has not yet launched those talks. We will be watching for them if they do get under way.",
      "Let's get to the other news of the week, the reshuffling at the top of the national security apparatus. It has long been clear there are divides within the administration on certain topics. Iran is one of them. Russia is another one of them. Mike Waltz, who you served with, viewed as a traditional Republican hawk.",
      "I say this because, when he was on this program previously, he laid out in pretty clear terms that the U.S. goal in these negotiations with Iran are dismantlement of its nuclear program, not limits on enrichment, not verification, but those are the things that the envoy negotiating with Iran have said.",
      "We're seeing policy differences from within the president's own administration here. Has Congress been given details on what the goal is and what the plan is?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, the goal is simply stated, that we do not have a nuclear Iran.",
      "And, certainly, the president is leaning strongly in that. From his first term, with the maximum pressure campaign, the president was clear that, both in non-nuclear Iran and also making certain that we have \u2013 that the nefarious activities of Iran working through their proxies, the terrorist groups and organizations, that that be stopped.",
      "So the president is very strong on an anti-Iran policy, including ensuring that there not be a nuclear Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the things that his envoy have described sound a lot like that 2015 nuclear deal negotiated under President Obama, with limits on enrichment, for example, and things like that.",
      "I know in the past you voted for legislation that would give Congress more oversight over a deal with Iran. Do you expect President Trump to bring any kind of deal he brokers to Congress for approval?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think we have to see what the deal is.",
      "I mean, currently, there's just ongoing negotiations. We will have to see how that evolves. We will have to see what those terms are and really \u2013 well, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want any kind of review regardless?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I mean, as it evolves, we will have to see what those terms are and what \u2013 and really what is achieved.",
      "And, certainly, there's a role for Congress to play as that goes forward. But I think we need to give them the opportunity for success.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Israeli prime minister issued a statement yesterday denying that he personally was talking to Mike Waltz about bombing Iran, military action against Iran. Of course, we know his aides could have those conversations.",
      "Is it appropriate work for the national security adviser to the president to be coordinating with Israel about military action against Iran, or was Mike Waltz possibly in the wrong here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, first off, we don't know specifically that that was occurring.",
      "But, at the same time, the National Security Council, the function of the National Security Council is to ensure that the president of the United States has the greatest information possible. And Mike Waltz is \u2013 has an incredible background and experience. He worked diligently to make certain he had a strong role in the national security team of the president.",
      "And I'm certainly glad that he's going to be retained and staying in a strong role in this administration. Working directly with world leaders and heads of state is certainly an important role of \u2013 as the national security adviser to the president. And I \u2013 certainly, I think, even as U.N. ambassador, he will continue to do that type of function.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it in the national security interest, though, to have the secretary of state, who also has, at least on paper, three other jobs now, in this role, and for how long?",
      "You're saying how important it is.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, it certainly \u2013 certainly, we know Henry Kissinger has been in that position before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And even he said it was untenable.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And even \u2013 but he was in lockstep with his president.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think what's also very important here is that Marco Rubio, from a policy perspective, is very strong in this administration. His signal of being in this position sends a signal of continuing the same policies in the administration.",

      "And that's certainly hope \u2013 hopefully that he will be able to do so and build out a strong team there that represents really the opportunity to support President Trump in giving him the information and knowledge and the access to information and knowledge that he needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a diplomatic way of saying there shouldn't be loyalty tests to the president. You want actual experts staffing National Security Council. You don't want Laura Loomer, a far right activist, making decisions on personnel?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, at the same time, there does have to be loyalty to the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course, but also to the Constitution.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I mean, we saw in the president's first term that the president was betrayed during the first Trump impeachment by individuals who were at the National Security Council.",
      "So Trump personally has an understanding that you have to have people at the National Security Council that are on Trump's team. And the National Security Council, being \u2013 directly working with him and being in the White House, it's very, very important that they be personnel that work for and on behalf of the president.",

      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: No. There's no way he can do that and do it well, especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD with Pete Hegseth being secretary of defense, and just the hollowing out of the top leadership.",
      "There's no way he can carry all that entire load on his own. And so I do think that they need to find a new secretary of defense. They need to find a new NSA \u2013 head of NSA as quickly as possible.",

      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think he should be dismissed.",
      "Whether or not President Trump's going to dismiss him is a whole different conversation. He should never have been nominated in the first place. He is the most untrained, inadequate secretary of defense in our nation's history. And look at what he's done at the Pentagon. It's in turmoil.",
      "He lost his top staffers within a matter of days. He's now put classified information an unclassified chain, and he's put on our nation's national security at risk.",

      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: We don't have a timeline. It is very serious.",

Our farmers are just being battered by the Trump administration right now. The tariffs are hurting them with the products they're trying to sell. The inputs that they're trying to import in order to plan and grow their crops are being priced out of range.",

And, you know, as you know, after that meeting, we have signed really a great agreement, economic partnership agreement between our two nations, which will take that partnership to a new level.",

Ukraine wants peace more than anyone, and we need U.S. We \u2013 we \u2013 our countries are based on the same values. We are defending freedom in Ukraine. We are not the ones who started this war.",

I've read that the deal counts future U.S. military assistance in the form of ammunition, weapon systems and training as a contribution to the investment fund, and that Ukraine will not reimburse Washington for past military aid. Is that how it's set up?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador): Well, we - first of all, it's important that it's going to be, as we say, a 50/50 deal. So we, together, will set up that fund, we will run it together. And all the future contribution that - or investments that U.S. will be providing us, including military deals, will be counted as contribution to that fund, and Ukraine will be also committing the proceeds from the new licenses and new developments into the fund. So, essentially, it's a true partnership where we would be able to put resources together in order to invest into a wide range of projects, including infrastructure, including rare earths, including critical minerals, and both of our nations will benefit from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When does that get up and running?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: We're working very actively on it. As you saw, the deal between the governments have been signed. It's going to be ratified by our parliament hopefully soon. You have seen strong messages from President Zelenskyy. And it's his vision and vision of President Trump behind the deal that is moving it forward.",
      "Of course, there will be the creation of the fund, the set-up of the fund. I used to work in private equity in my previous life. That takes a little bit of time. But we are moving very fast. So, hopefully the teams will come - put everything together and we'll start working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But within this there aren't security guarantees. Are there promises of future military aid from the United States? Because if this effort to get a peace deal together doesn't work, the fate of the war is still in question.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, you know, this - the situation with Russian aggression towards Ukraine is so complex. There are many - we've discussed the potential possible peace deals. We're discussing this economic partnership deal which is already signed. We're discussing other possible scenarios and security guarantees and involvement of other friends and allies. And, you know, Europe has been more active and proactive in a number of areas.",
      "So, this economic partnership deal in itself is a very important part of the broader security, security architecture, if I may say so. And, frankly, that fund will be successful if Ukraine is stable and peaceful. So, in a way, it's an important part of the future security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin told Russian state TV, he thinks that he can bring this war to a logical conclusion. He avoided the word war. He said this thing that started in 2022. But he said, here's been no need to use nuclear weapons and, quote, \"I hope they will not be required.\"",
      "How do you interpret that?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, it's very difficult to interpret a man and a so- called leader of the nation who attack Georgia in 2008, attacked Ukraine in 2014, conducted two genocidal wars on his own in his own federation against Chechnya, the war crimes in Syria, poisoned people in - in Great Britain. I mean, I think at this point it doesn't matter how we interpret what he says, we just have to believe what he says and understand what he says.",

But then, as of Friday morning, we found Wong was still on the job. It is not clear what the National Security Council makeup will be or how long the secretary of state will be at the head of it advising the president.",
      "What significance does this have for America's national security?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: I think it's significant, Margaret, because I think what it reveals is, is a fight that's going on within the administration associated with the - our role in the world and how certain people in the administration perceive America's role in the world. And I think Mike Waltz as an America first guy, but he was an internationalist and prioritized, I think, our alliances. He knew that, I think, that, quite correctly, that Putin won't stop until he is stopped. And so, he was an advocate for a strong approach to Putin. And I think there were those in the administration that have a much different world view, you know, who are in favor of - of U.S. retrenchment or disengagement from complex challenges abroad and want to prioritize kind of the western hemisphere/North American defense. And you see that in your discussion with - with Congressman Turner as well associated with the defense budget and what's being prioritized in the defense budget as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you see this as a - as a policy argument, not just a Signal messaging mistake that, you know, Mike Waltz created that channel where he accidentally included a reporter?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: It is. I think it's a - it's a policy issue, a world view issue, but it's also an understanding of the role of the - the national security council staff and the national security staff that - that - that Mike Waltz was running, and Alex Wong is - is still running. And - and that's really the staff that allows the president to drive his agenda, that gets best analysis, best advice to the president and gets him multiple options.",
      "It seems pretty clear that President Trump is not very patient in terms of a deliberative process these days, and this is why I think he may see the National Security Council staff as an impediment instead of really the best vehicle to drive his agenda and to integrate all elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to advance American interests.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, I thought it was an interesting point Congressman Turner made when he brought up the specific point of reference the president has for the National Security Council during his first term, which is, Turner argued, seeing them as the reason he was impeached where - during his first impeachment related to Ukraine. Do you think that is something that makes him distrust that counsel? Why is it that he would take the advice of someone like Laura Loomer, this far right activist who has made racist attacks on some of the members of that council?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: You know, Margaret, I think there are three times of people in any administration, those who are there to give the president best advice, those who are there not for that but want to manipulate decisions consistent with their own agenda. These are people inside and outside of the administration. And there's a third group of people who sometimes take on the role of maybe saving the country and the world from the president. That second and third group, if you have an effective national security decision-making process that gives the president multiple options, they tend to oppose that process. They tend to oppose the national security adviser.",
      "And I think what you're seeing is how easy it is for certain people to get in the president's ear, to sow distrust, to drive a wedge between him and the national security adviser in this case or the national security staff and those who are there to get him multiple options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced the different world view of some of the people advising the president right now. Particularly regarding our allies.",
      "In Europe, we saw an interesting decision this week in Germany. Their domestic intelligence agency concluded an investigation into a far-right political party known as AFD. They declared it to be an extremist group because of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim positions. Their leaders have trivialized the Holocaust. They've called for deporting non-white citizens because that violates the German constitution.",
      "This would sound like a domestic issue. However, the vice president and the secretary of state have taken very public statements here wading into this. Rubio calling it \"tyranny in disguise.\" Vice President Vance also weighing in here. Do you think that's advisable when that party's leaders have such a troubled history? Can you explain it?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: Yes, part - part of this, Margaret, is - is what you covered earlier in the show about this kind of women, peace and security initiative, as well as I would say some of the radical DEI agendas of the Biden and maybe the Obama administration before that. This is like an equal and opposite reaction. And it's international.",
      "And this is one of the reasons why there are some people in the United States who kind of regard Putin as - as - as the savior of - of western civilization, or - or Christianity and so forth, which is obviously kind of a - a perverse view of him as well.",
      "But I think what's related to this is this sort of - this emphasis on, you know, retrenchment, just take care of ourself, disengage from the world and - and I think that these are - are related. What's - what's, I think, interesting about this though is that the Trump administration, I think, risks replicating the flaws of the Obama administration's policy, because what you see is, now some people in the Republican Party seeing the source of all ills in the world as, like, the neocons and - and they trace it back in particular to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.",
      "So, that blaming ourselves, other Americans for the ills of the world, and the associated impulse toward disengagement risks recreating, I think, some of the fundamental flaws in sort of the Obama administration approach to the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, thank you for sharing your insight.",
      "We'll leave it there.",
      "And we'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "Good to have you both together.",
      "PAULA KERGER (CEO, PBS): Great to be here.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER (CEO, NPR): Thank you for having us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president issued this order for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which oversees you both, to cut off funding. Are you both filing lawsuits? And on what basis can you challenge this?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: We're looking at whatever options are available to us. I think it's a little preliminary for us to be able to speak to the specific strategies that we might take.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that the same for pbs?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Yes. We're, obviously, looking. And I would just say, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a funding mechanism, but they actually don't oversee PBS or NPR. We're independent organizations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Important point to make.",
      "But the threat of cutting off funding -",
      "PAULA KERGER: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Whether it was in Congress or the president saying he's doing it now. That's not new, right? That's been a talking point for years. There have been efforts in Congress. You do have funding, I think, through 2027, but it feels a little bit different this time. Do you have a backup funding plan?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Yes, it is different this time. And I've been through these battles now for a number of years. I've been at PBS almost 20 years. And I remember even going back to the Newt Gingrich days.",
      "But this is different. They're coming after us on many different ways. We're waiting for a possible rescission of those funds that have already been appropriated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're clawing them back.",
      "PAULA KERGER: There was an effort within the FCC challenging our ability to accept sponsorships from corporations, which is something that we have worked with the FCC on for many, many years. There was the executive order. There was the effort to try to remove a few members of the CPB board. So, we have never seen a circumstance like this. And, obviously, we're going to be pushing back very hard because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations across the country. We get 15 percent of our funding from the federal government. That's 1-5 percent, but that's an aggregate number. Some of our stations in small communities, it's 40 percent to 50 percent of their funding. And for them it's existential. And that's what's at risk if this funding goes away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is it immediate for NPR?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: In - in a similar fashion. If we were to see a claw back of these funds, which we know is part of the conversation from a rescission standpoint, or if we were to see that the stations were no longer able to participate in their membership due, that would be damaging.",
      "But I think that Paula's point is the one that really people need to hear. The immediate damage is to local stations. And with NPR we have stations in more than - 246 stations with newsrooms, we're in 200 newsrooms in every state in the country, and that includes journalists who are out there covering their local communities, especially in a time where we're seeing an advance of news deserts across the nation, 20 percent of Americans don't have access to another local source of news. The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president tweeted, or socialed, or truthed, \"Republicans must defund and totally disassociate themselves from NPR and PBS, the radical left monsters that so badly hurt our country.\"",
      "I have to tell you, I heard monsters and I thought of Cookie Monster.",
      "PAULA KERGER: I did too, actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought of \"Sesame Street\" and I thought of that children's programming.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is in many - many ways what people think of when they think of PBS.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely. (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that impacted too?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely. And out of this executive order, we believe it impacts our funding out of the Department of Education, which is a 30-year program that has supported the development - not only the creation of many of the children's programming that you see on public television, but also the research that we do to ensure that that programming is not just safe and enjoyable, but that children, after watching, come away with understanding of basic letters and numbers. Half the kids in this country are not enrolled in formal pre-k. That's why programming for children on public television was created. That was the idea with \"Sesame Street\" and \"Mister Rogers.\" And everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool. That may be at age two, or three, or four, and sometimes five, not until they start kindergarten. That's what's at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At risk or right now? I mean, do you have the money to keep functioning?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Well, we have programming, so you're not going to turn on your TV set and not see our children's programming anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "PAULA KERGER: But if that funding is cut off, we have programs in development right now. And that will suddenly skid to a halt. We also have stations around the country that work directly with preschool providers and parents, and this funds those activities. So, the immediate impact would be fairly significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Katherine, I want to ask you about the news. When we went and we read the executive order, the language in there says, \"government funding of news media in this environment is outdated and unnecessary, corrosive to the appearance of independence. Ad Americans have the right to expect if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting, that it's fair, accurate, unbiased and non-partisan.\"",
      "How do you respond to the implication that your news coverage is not?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Is not fair and - and non-partisan? I mean I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And unbiased.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Yes, I mean, well, first of all, I think it's important to note that I'm the CEO and we have an independent editor in chief who oversees the newsroom. And so, I don't make editorial decisions. And that, I think, is just always an important point to make.",
      "But I think our newsroom would really take issue with that. We have been on air for more than 50 years. We have been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, oversees. We have an extraordinary Washington desk. And our people report straight down the line. And I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting as we bring people together in those conversations.",
      "And so, we've had a whole host of conservative voices on air of late. We've been making requests of the Trump administration to have their officials on air. We would like to see more people accept those invitations. It's hard for us to be able to say we can speak for everyone when folks won't join us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that was the executive order. Then we went and we looked at the White House talking points and what they're putting on social media. They're a lot more about you than you. And on NPR they were saying things like, July 2022 editor's note that said the Declaration of Independent had offensive language against Native Americans. We checked, and the word \"savages\" is used. The White House faults your editors for avoiding the term \"biological sex\" when discussing transgender issues. They apparently want you to use the term \"pro-life\" and faulted your use of the term \"anti-abortion rights\" to refer to activists.",
      "So, when you see specific editorial criticisms like that, what do you interpret the intention of this being.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Well, I interpret the intention of this being - trying to create a narrative around our editorial independence. And as I said in our",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To control it and then (INAUDIBLE)?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: To control it. And I think that that's a - that is an affront to the First Amendment. We have an independent newsroom and we will always have an independent newsroom.",
      "From my perspective, part of the separation of - that the First Amendment offers to keep government out. In fact, the statute that was written when the Public Broadcasting Act was signed into law was very explicit about interference from any member of the government, whether it is elected officials, whether members of independent agencies, because it is so sacrosanct, that division between the state and independent media.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Set it up as a private corporation to give protection from influence and control. I would assume that's also from the White House, influence and control.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: That's right. And President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the bill into law creating public - the Public Broadcasting Act and creating the system that we all operate within, was - was very note - he noted in his remarks upon signing that speech was that it does requires a greater wisdom, and that's why we have a two-year advance appropriation is to - is to insulate both of our work from political interference. I think that that is critical that Americans understand that public broadcasting is meant to be independent so that we can serve the public interest regardless of whatever administration is in office or whatever Congress' whims are.",
      "PAULA KERGER: And the - and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was set up as a private corporation with that same intent. So, I think there was a lot of focus, even at that moment, in - when the act was signed that protections would need to be put in place, because if we do our job, it is - it is possible that we will produce content that some people may wish we have done a different way. And this way it gives us the independence this way.",
      "The other thing that keeps us independent is that most of our funding comes from viewers like you. We ask people to make contribution to public broadcasting for something they get for free.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Because we are available free to every home in this country. And so, both the combination of the fact that it was built as a public/private partnership, there would be some public money that went into public broadcasting that would enable stations in small communities to exist, alongside the fact that most of our support comes from people in communities. That really does create something that is very independent and very responsive to the communities that we serve.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: And if I may, just to give a sense of those numbers, for every single dollar that the federal government puts in, stations raise on average about $7 -",
      "PAULA KERGER: Right.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: From public/private - sorry, from private sources. And so you also have to recognize that this order interferes with the First Amendment rights of our listeners and viewers who have made a choice to contribute. And this is the news that they want to see and hear, or the programming that they are committed to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It did just stand out to us, as journalists ourselves, because the research shows that, you know, there's declining trust in media, in news, and the president was talking about that himself there, that he wants a free and fair press.",
      "We're going to continue to cover this. And thank you for your time today.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: You bet.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Thank you for having us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

And with NPR, we have stations in more than 246 stations with newsrooms- more than 200 newsrooms in every state in the country, and that includes journalists who are out there covering their local communities, especially in a time where we're seeing an advance of news deserts across the nation, 20% of Americans don't have access to another local source of news. The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president tweeted or social or truthed, \"Republicans must defund and totally disassociate themselves from NPR and PBS, the radical left monsters that so badly hurt our country.\" I have to tell you, I heard monsters, and I thought of Cookie Monster.",
      "PAULA KERGER: I did too actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought of Sesame Street, and I thought of that children's programming that is in many, many ways, what people think of when they think of PBS.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that impacted too?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely. And out of this executive order, we believe it impacts our funding out of the Department of Education, which is a 30 year program that has supported the develop, not only the creation of many of the children's programming that you see on public television, but also the research that we do to ensure that that programming is not just safe and enjoyable, but that children, after watching, come away with understanding of basic letters and numbers. Half the kids in this country are not enrolled in formal pre K. That's why programming for children on public television was created. That was the idea with Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers and everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool, that may be at age two or three or four and sometimes five, not until they start kindergarten. That's what's at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At risk, or right now? I mean, do you have the money to keep functioning?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Well, we have programming. So you're not going to turn on your TV set and not see our children's programming anymore, but if that funding is cut off, we have programs in development right now, and that will suddenly skid to a halt. We also have stations around the country that work directly with preschool providers and parents, and this funds those activities, so the immediate impact would be fairly significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Katherine, I want to ask you about the news when we went and we read the executive order, the language in there says \"government funding of news media in this environment is outdated and unnecessary, corrosive to the appearance of independence, and Americans have the right to expect, if the tax dollars fund public broadcasting, that it's fair, accurate, unbiased and non partisan.\" How do you respond to the implication that your news coverage is not?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Is not fair and non-partisan? I mean-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unbiased.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Yeah. I mean, well, first of all, I think it's important to note that I'm the CEO, and we have an independent editor in chief who oversees the newsroom, and so I don't make editorial decisions, and that, I think, is just an always important point to make, but I think our newsroom would really take issue with that. We have been on air for more than 50 years. We've been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, overseas. We have an extraordinary Washington desk and our people report straight down the line, and I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting, as we bring people together in those conversations. And so we've had a whole host of conservative voices on air. Of late, we've been making requests of the Trump administration to have their officials on air. We would like to see more people accept those invitations. It's hard for us to be able to say we can speak for everyone when folks won't join us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that was the executive order. Then we went, we looked at the White House talking points and what they're putting on social media. They're a lot more about you than you. And on NPR, they were saying things like a July 2022 editor's note that said the declaration of independence had offensive language against Native Americans. We checked and the word savages is used. The White House faults your editors for avoiding the term biological sex when discussing transgender issues, they apparently want you to use the term pro-life and faulted your use of the term anti-abortion rights to refer to activists. So when you see specific editorial criticisms like that, what do you interpret the intention of this being?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Well, I interpret the intention of this being trying to create a narrative around our editorial independence, and, as I said\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To control it?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: To control it. And I think that that's- that is an affront to the First Amendment. We have an independent newsroom, and we will always have an independent newsroom. From my perspective, part of the separation of the First Amendment offers is to keep government out. In fact, the statute that was written when the Public Broadcasting Act was signed into law was very explicit about interference from any member of the government, whether it is elected officials, whether members of independent agencies, because it is so sacrosanct that division between the state and independent media.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 set it up as a private corporation to give protection from influence and control. I would assume that's also from the White House, influence and control.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: that's right. And President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the bill into law, creating the Public Broadcasting Act and creating the system that we all operate within, was was very note he noted in his remarks, upon signing that speech, was that it does require a greater wisdom, and that's why we have a two year advance appropriation is to is to insulate both of our work from political interference. I think that that is critical that Americans understand that public broadcasting is meant to be independent, so that we can serve the public interest, regardless of whatever administration is in office or whatever Congress whims are.",
      "PAULA KERGER: And the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was set up as a private corporation with that same intent. So I think there was a lot of focus, even at that moment in when the Act was signed, that protections would need to be put in place, because if we do our job, it is, it is possible that we will produce content that some people may wish we have done a different way, and this way, it gives us the independence. This way- The other thing that keeps us independent is that most of our funding comes from viewers like you. We ask people to make contributions to public broadcasting for something they get for free because we are available, free to every home in this country. And so both the combination of the fact that it was built as a public private partnership, there would be some public money that went into public broadcasting that would enable stations and small communities to exist, alongside the fact that most of our support comes from people and communities. That really does create something that is very independent and very responsive to the communities that we serve.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: And if I may, just to give a sense of those numbers, for every single dollar that the federal government puts in stations, raise, on average, about $7 right from public- private- from private sources. And so you also have to recognize that this order interferes with the First Amendment rights of our listeners and viewers who have made a choice to contribute, and this is the news that they want to see and hear, or the programming that they are committed to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It did just stand out to us as journalists ourselves, because the research shows that, you know, there's declining trust in media, in news, and the President was talking about that himself there that he wants a free and fair press. We're going to continue to cover this, and thank you for your time today.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Thank you for having us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Sunday that she expects Mike Waltz to have a \"brutal hearing\" for U.N. ambassador after his surprise departure last week from his post as President Trump's national security adviser.",
      "\"He's not qualified for the job, just by nature of the fact that he participated in this Signal chain,\" Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Duckworth argued that everyone in the group chat where the timing and targets of an attack on Houthis in Yemen was shared and was revealed in March to have inadvertently included a journalist, should be fired, because \"not a single one of them spoke up.\"",
      "\"Now, Mike Waltz is doing what we call \u2014 he is failing up,\" Duckworth said. \"He is failing in his job and getting promoted to be ambassador. That's not what our nation needs at the United Nations.\"",
      "Before he was tapped as national security adviser, Waltz had represented Florida in the House since 2019, and he is a Green Beret veteran who served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa. After the reports that Waltz was out as national security adviser were published, President Trump said he planned to nominate him as U.N. ambassador.",
      "Though the national security adviser post did not require Senate confirmation, the job as ambassador to the United Nations does, teeing up a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the near future.",
      "Duckworth, who sits on the committee, said she's \"not open to voting for him,\" arguing that he's \"already demonstrated he's incapable of doing the most basic thing, which is handling classified information.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's first pick for U.N. ambassador, Rep. Elise Stefanik, withdrew her name from consideration due to concerns about an open seat in Congress.",
      "President Trump announced Thursday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would take over for Waltz as national security adviser, in addition to previously giving him the duties of acting USAID administrator and acting archivist. Duckworth voted with 98 of her colleagues in the Senate to confirm Rubio as secretary of state in January. But when asked whether she's confident that he can juggle all four jobs, Duckworth said no, while pointing to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "\"Especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD, with Pete Hegseth being Secretary of Defense, and just the hollowing out of the top leadership, there's no way he can carry all that entire load on his own,\" Duckworth said of Rubio.",
      "Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who also sits on the Senate Armed Forces Committee, argued that Hegseth should be dismissed. But, she added, \"whether or not President Trump's going to dismiss him, is a whole different conversation.\"",
      "\"He should never have been nominated in the first place,\" Duckworth said, calling Hegseth \"the most untrained, inadequate, Secretary of Defense in our nation's history.\"",
      "After it was revealed in March that an Atlantic journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat where the timing and targets of an attack on Houthis in Yemen was shared, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, announced a bipartisan request for an expedited watchdog investigation into the Signal chat leak. Duckworth said senators don't have a timeline for results of the investigation, while calling the situation \"very serious.\"",
      "\"He put into an unclassified Signal chain that the aircraft are going to be over a certain point in space at a certain point in time,\" Duckworth said. \"That's classified information. Any basic person getting through military training knows that is classified information.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who\u00a0previously led the House Intelligence Committee and also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, said Waltz \"has an incredible background and experience,\" adding that he's \"certainly glad that he's going to be retained and staying in a strong role in this administration.\"",
      "On Rubio, Turner noted that Henry Kissinger also served as both secretary of state and national security adviser in the 1970s. And he said Rubio, from a policy perspective, is \"very strong in this administration,\" noting that his taking over the national security adviser post \"sends a signal of continuing the same policies in the administration\" and a \"signal of continuation and strength,\" which he called \"excellent.\"",
      "Turner said now Rubio should be given the opportunity to build out the team on the National Security Council, adding that hopefully he will be able to build a \"strong team there that represents, really, the opportunity to support President Trump.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Makarova. Ambassador, good to have you back. I understand Russia has been attacking Kyiv as recently as overnight. What can you tell us?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Good morning, Margaret. Yes, another very difficult day and night in Kyiv, and not only Kyiv, Cherkasy and some other places, more than 165 Shahed drones, Iranian drones, have been deployed again against completely civilian targets. So unfortunately, this is a horrible reality during the past 1,166 days. Every day, regardless of Russia says, there are some attacks and there are civilian casualties and there are civilian destructions. And for the same 1,166 days, we work diligently on getting- not only defending us, but getting to peace. And Ukraine is devoted to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been a shift, in tone, at least, between the Trump administration and your president. President Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that his conversation with President Trump at the Pope's funeral was the best meeting they've ever had, and he's confident things will look different now. What is he indicating? What's coming next? When do they speak next?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Look, our partnership with the U.S. is very important for us. U.S. has been and is a strategic partnership. We are really grateful to American people for all the support that we are getting from the U.S. It would not be possible for us to defend ourselves without those Javelins, without those weapons that U.S. has provided us, and it was President Trump who decided to provide us Javelins, as- when- when I was still a finance minister--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: --and it was back in 2017, and then large support from American people during the past three years have really been a game changer, and we are very grateful for it. The meeting was great. And you know, as you know, after that meeting, we have signed, really, a great agreement, economic partnership agreement, between our two nations, which will take that partnership to a new level. So look, we might have some disagreements on- on- in some areas, but Ukraine is committed to peace. Ukraine wants peace more than anyone, and we need U.S. We- we- our countries are based on the same values. We are defending freedom in Ukraine. We are not the ones who started this war. And now it's not only the right or moral thing to do, to- the fact to support Ukraine, but also, U.S. has, as your Secretary of Treasury said, an interest and specific economic interest in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about that deal. This is what's often described as a minerals agreement, but it's a broader economic partnership that's going forth for ratification in your government this week, I understand. This was agreed to, but Russia's Foreign Minister has said that the mineral deposits that exist in Ukraine, in the east, are one reason his country wouldn't withdraw from that area. So can the U.S. and Ukraine make this deal work if Russian troops are still in the area where those mineral deposits largely are?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Margaret, as you said, this is an economic partnership agreement to create an investment fund to- for both of our nations to benefit from amazing investment opportunities that Ukraine has. We discussed before, and I'm so glad that we can not only discuss the horrible tragedy and destruction brought by a Russian unprovoked invasion, but also of the bright future that we, together with America, and- and other countries, can have. Ukraine has agricultural land and black soil, and with the technologies, even during the war, we feed more than 400 million people. We have energy, we have mineral- critical mineral deposits. We have so much, including the human talent, and we can develop it together. So look, when Russians criticize something, it's a sign for all of us that we are doing something right. This deal will work, and it will work if Ukraine is peaceful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk- Let's talk more on the other side of this commercial break, we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We return now to our conversation with Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Makarova. We've been discussing the deal that the United States and Ukraine came to in regard to this economic partnership. I've read that the deal counts future U.S. military assistance in the form of ammunition, weapons systems, and training as a contribution to the investment fund, and that Ukraine will not reimburse Washington for past military aid. Is that how it's set up?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, we- first of all, it's important that it's going to be, as we say, 50/50 deal. So we, together, will set up that fund. We will run it together, and all the future contribution that- or investments that U.S. will be providing us, including military deals, will be counted as contribution to that fund, and Ukraine will be also committing the proceeds from the new licenses and new developments into the fund. So essentially, it's- it's a true partnership where we would be able to put resources together in order to invest into a wide range of projects, including infrastructure, including rare earths, including critical minerals, and both of our nations will benefit from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When does that get up and running?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: We are working very actively on it. As you saw, the deal between the governments have been signed. It's going to be ratified by our parliament, hopefully soon. You have seen strong messages from President Zelenskyy, and it's his vision and vision of President Trump behind the deal that is moving it forward. Of course, there will be the creation of the fund, the setup of the fund. I used to work in private equity in my previous life. That takes a little bit of time, but we are moving very fast, so hopefully the teams will come, put everything together, and we'll start working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But within this there aren't security guarantees. Are there promises of future military aid from the United States? Because if this pea- effort to get a peace deal together doesn't work, the fate of the war is still in- in question.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, you know this- the situation with Russian aggression towards Ukraine is so complex. There are many- we're discussing the potential possible peace deals. We are discussing this economic partnership deal, which is already signed. We're discussing other possible scenarios and security guarantees and involvement of other friends and allies. And you know, Europe has been more active and proactive in- in a number of areas. So this economic partnership deal in itself is a very important part of the broader security- security architecture, if- if I may say so. And frankly, that fund will be successful if Ukraine is stable and peaceful. So in a way, it's an important part of the future security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin told Russian state TV he thinks that he can bring this war to a logical conclusion- he avoided the word war, he said, this thing that started in 2022. But he said, there has been no need to use nuclear weapons. And quote, \"I hope they will not be required.\" How do you interpret that?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, it's very difficult to interpret a man and a so-called leader of the nation who attacked Georgia in 2008, attacked Ukraine in 2014, conducted two genocidal wars on his own, in his own Federation, against Chechnya. Did war crimes in Syria, poisoned people in- in Great Britain. I mean, I think at this point it doesn't matter how we interpret what he says. We just have to believe what he says and understand what he says. He is a threat, not only to Ukraine, but also to anyone who believes that nations should live peacefully, do not challenge each other's borders, and just focus on the economic cooperation. That's what we are doing with the United States, and hopefully our collective efforts, and with Europe, with all the Baltic and Nordic states, with all the friends and allies, including Japan, including UK, including so many people that are coming together in order to bring peace, not only to our part of the world, but globally. Because it's- it's important. Putin is doing it together with Iran and North Korea. They are not hiding it. They are supporting other terroristic regimes, and we should also stay together in order to bring peace.",

Take a listen.",

      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think there's going to be a lot that has to be- be shaken out here. And we certainly are seeing, I think, some reaction now in China also. That means that, you know, the President's goal is that these nations, that of which he's putting tariffs on the table, and tariffs which are a punishment for having behaved poorly taken advantage of the United States economically, will come to the table and negotiate better economic deals than the United States has been experiencing. Those- those deals are beginning to be offered. The White House is beginning to negotiate those. China is beginning to signal that they're willing to come to the table. So even though the President is making those statements at the same time, we're seeing that the President taking that step of saying we want a better economic deal is beginning to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, China said it may restrict exports of materials used by General Dynamics, which makes tanks, including in your state of Ohio. Are you concerned that the trade war won't just impact people's purchasing of toys, but preparedness, tanks and military readiness?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think we're all concerned of the effects on the supply chain, and certainly we've got to make certain that this works through the entire processes, and that we are concerned of the effects of the economy. I think the President is going to be looking at that. Congress is going to be looking at that. But the real concern here is- is that we do have to look long term as to how this protects our overall economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Beijing has not yet launched those talks. We'll be watching for them if they do get underway. Let's get to the other news of the week, the reshuffling at the top of the national security apparatus. It has long been clear there are divides within the Administration on certain topics. Iran is one of them. Russia is another one of them. Mike Waltz, who you served with, viewed as a traditional Republican hawk. I say this because when he was on this program previously, he laid out in pretty clear terms that the US goal in these negotiations with Iran are dismantlement of its nuclear program. Not limits on enrichment, not verification. But those are the things that the envoy negotiating with Iran have said. We're seeing policy differences from within the President's own administration here. Has Congress been given details on what the goal is and what the plan is?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I mean, the goal is simply stated that we do not have a nuclear Iran, and certainly the President is leaning strongly in that from his first term with the maximum pressure campaign, the President was clear that both in non-nuclear Iran and also making certain that we have that the nefarious activities of Iran working through their proxies, the terrorist groups and organizations that that be stopped. So the President is very strong on an anti-Iran policy, including ensuring that there not be a nuclear Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the things that his envoy have described sound a lot like that, 2015 nuclear deal negotiated under President Obama with limits on enrichment, for example, and things like that. I know in the past, you voted for legislation that would give Congress more oversight over a deal with Iran. Do you expect President Trump to bring any kind of deal he brokers to Congress for approval?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think we have to see what the deal is. I mean, currently there's just ongoing negotiations. We'll have to see how that evolves. Let's see what those terms are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- You don't want--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- and really--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- any kind of review regardless?",
      "REP. TURNER: I mean, as it evolves, we'll have to see what those terms are and what in- and really what you know, what is achieved, and certainly there's a role for Congress to play as that goes forward. But I think we need to give them the opportunity for success.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Israeli Prime Minister issued a statement yesterday denying that he personally was talking to Mike Waltz about bombing Iran- military action against Iran. Of course, we know his aides could have those conversations. Is it appropriate work for the National Security Advisor to the President to be coordinating with Israel about military action against Iran, or was Mike Waltz possibly in the wrong here?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, first off, we don't know specifically that was occurring, but at the same time the National Security Council- the function of the National Security Council is to ensure that the President of United States has the greatest information possible. And Mike Waltz is, you know, has an incredible background and experience. He worked diligently to make certain he had a strong role in the national security team of the president. And I'm certainly glad that he's going to be retained and staying in a strong role in this administration, working directly with- with world leaders and heads of state is certainly an important role of- as the National Security Advisor to the President. Certainly, I think even as you and Ambassador, he'll continue to do that type of function.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it in the national security interest, though, to have the Secretary of State who also has, at least on paper, three other jobs now in this role, and for how long? I mean you're saying how important it is.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Even he said that it was untenable. But he was in lockstep with his president.",

His signal of being, of it, being in this position, sends a signal of continuing the same policies in the administration. From a Trump team policy perspective, you know, him taking over this sends a signal of continuation and strength. That's excellent--",

TURNER: -- Now, we've got to give- now we've got to give him the opportunity of, is he going to be able to build out the team in the National Security Council, and that certainly hope, hopefully, that- that he'll be able to do so and build up a strong team there that represents, really the opportunity to support President Trump and giving him the- the information and knowledge and the access to information and knowledge that he needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a diplomatic way of saying there shouldn't be loyalty tests to the President. You want actual experts staffing the National Security Council. You don't want Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, making decisions on personnel.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, at the same time, there does have to be loyalty to the President--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- but also to the Constitution--",
      "REP. TURNER:-- that the President was betrayed during the first Trump impeachment by individuals who were at the National Security Council. So, Trump personally has an understanding that you have to have people in the National Security Council that are on Trump's team and the National Security Council being directly working with him and being in the White House, it's very, very important that they be personnel that work for and on behalf of the President.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are talking about national security council members who testified under oath that the President was withholding aid to Ukraine during the first administration for a political--",
      "REP. TURNER: And was shown to have wrongly being testified because I was part of that- that panel and they- they- their testimony was proven not to be accurate, that the President was not tying aid to Ukraine to- to the investigation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The premise of the impeachment. But your point is that looms large in the President's memory and interaction with the National Security Council now.",
      "REP. TURNER: The President needs to make certain that he has staff that are supportive of him in the National Security Council and his policies and make certain that they're providing him information. This is the heart of what does the President know that our adversaries are doing. When he's dealing with Russia, and what and policies with respect to Ukraine, he needs to know what Vladimir Putin is doing, and that's coming directly from the National Security Council.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted. The White House budget was released Friday. It is not the trillion dollar promise the President campaigned on. Susan Collins on Appropriations, Roger Wicker in the Senate Armed Services Committee says this is not adequate. And in fact, he said the intention is to shred to the bone our military capabilities and support to service members. Do you share your Republican senators' concerns?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think there's more work that can be done on the National Security portion of the President's budget.",

      "REP. TURNER: I think there's going to be more debate, and I think there's more opportunity for increased investment. We really need to do more in the national security space. There are adversaries that we have that want to do America harm, and we need to be strong.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 4, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. Good to have you here in person.",
      "SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Senator, I know you did vote to confirm Secretary Rubio. Do you have confidence that he can juggle all four of the jobs that he now has for an indefinite period of time?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: No. There's- there's no way he can do that and do it- and do it well, especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD, with Pete Hegseth being Secretary of Defense, and just the- the hollowing out of the top leadership. There's no way he can carry all- that entire load on his own, and so I do think that they need to find a new Secretary of Defense, they need to find a new NSA- head of NSA, as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, we heard from the Chief of Staff that she believes all the Cabinet secretaries will serve a full year. What makes you think that Secretary Hegseth could actually be dismissed?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I think he should be dismissed. Whether or not President Trump's going to dismiss him, is a whole different conversation. He should never have been nominated in the first place. He is the most untrained, inadequate, Secretary of Defense in our nation's history. And look at what he's done at the Pentagon. It's in turmoil. He lost his top staffers within a matter of days. He's now put classified information on an unclassified chain, and he's put on natures- our nation's national security at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says no war plans, wasn't classified, but it was sensitive information. That's part of this ongoing Inspector General probe, as I understand it, into his conduct. Do you have any timeline, any sense of how seriously that's being taken and when the results will be seen?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: We don't have a timeline. It is very serious. Let me make it clear what he did. He put into an unclassified Signal chain that the aircraft are going to be over a certain point in- in space, at a certain point in time. You know- that's classified information. Any basic person getting through military training knows that is classified information, and he did it on a separate chain with his wife and family members. This man is completely unqualified to be Secretary of Defense, and needs to be fired because he's putting our nation's military readiness at stake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because you sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Armed Services--",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Armed Services, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --what you think is going to happen to Mike Waltz, who is now being pushed out of the NSA role and into this job as Ambassador to the United Nations. That's arguably a pretty important post. Senate Intel Vice Chairman Mark Warner says it's going to be a brutal hearing. What do you want to know from him, and are you open to confirming him into the job?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm not on the Intelligence Committee, but I would- I am on Foreign Relations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Foreign Relations.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: I am foreign relations. It will be a brutal, brutal hearing. He's not qualified for the job, just by nature of the fact that he participated in this Signal chain. In fact, I think everybody on that Signal chain needs to be fired, because not a single one of them spoke up and said, hey, this is inappropriate. We should be in a secure channel. And they all had a secure channel\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Every single cabinet secretary seemed to be on that channel.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Everything- that was on that- Yes, they needed to. They need to be fired, because not a single one of them spoke up and said, this is- this is not correct. And by the way, what's really interesting was that there was not a single uniform personnel on that Signal chain, which was very clear that it was purposefully done to keep the military personnel with the experience off of that Signal chat. Now, Mike Waltz is doing what we call, he is failing up, right? He is failing in his job and getting promoted to be ambassador. That's not what our nation needs at the United Nations. This is a very perilous time for our national security, with everything that's happening in Ukraine, with everything that is happening in Israel and all around the world, with China, our- our greatest, closest adversary, gaining in strength, and now we're going to put somebody who's completely incompetent over at the UN, who's going to have to be conducting these negotiations, talking with our allies, trying to get them on board with us, while we oppose our adversaries, and continuing to fail up is not what we need in the people who represent this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Waltz served this country in uniform as a Green Beret. He was a lawmaker. You think he is incompetent and you're not open to voting for him at all?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: I'm not open to voting for him. No, because he- because he's already demonstrated he's incapable of doing the most basic thing, which is handling classified information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about funding for defense, because I know you said in particular, the Navy needs more money and more financial support right now, the Republican Chair of Appropriations and the Republican Chair of Armed Services both saw the White House's budget when it was released on Friday and said it freezes military spending at Biden-era levels, which they argue amounts to a reduction. Do you think that the two parties, if you both agree it is an imperative that the White House isn't taking seriously enough - Can you work together with your Republican allies to increase defense spending?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well one of the places where there has been bipartisanship has been the Armed Services Committee. That has been something that I've been very proud to be a part of. Now, whether or not my Republican colleagues continue to be co-conspirators and collaborators with this administration in basically gutting the United States government is- is up to them. You know, right now, their plans are going to require laying off hundreds- at least 100,000 civilian workers at the Pentagon. It's going to, in the words of Chairman Wicker, basically- I'm going to paraphrase him, cut defense capabilities to the bone. I think he is how he's put it. We need to make sure the Navy needs more ships. We need more merchant mariners need more boats, more ships. We need to make major investments in our sixth generation fighter fleet. We need to make major investments in training pilots. We are short pilots, and yet the cuts that they're proposing in order to fund a vanity project like the Golden Dome does not help make America more secure on a global scale, and it certainly doesn't keep us, you know, the leader of the free world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't often hear Democrats argue to increase defense spending.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: I voted to increase defense spending, yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have- right, you are- you are in a spot there where you're finding some common ground with your Republican partners on Armed Services. I want to ask you about one of the programs that is at least nominally being eliminated. Secretary Hegseth posted on social media, he's ending the Women, Peace and Security program. President Trump signed this into law in 2017. Hegseth said it is a divisive social justice initiative from feminists, a distraction from war fighting. But when we checked how the now chairman of the Joint Chiefs described it, General Caine, he said he used the program in the field, after an assault, to send in female members to speak with women and children to better understand \"human terrain.\" So if the military establishment says it's useful, and the Secretary of Defense says it's not, and it's a distraction, what happens? and can lawmakers like yourself actually rescue this program?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: We can, if Republicans will stop, you know, rolling over for this President. We can actually rescue this program. The program is critically important. It's supported by every combatant commander. It's a program that came about, by the way, Marco Rubio was one of the leaders--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Kristi Noem as a lawmaker, supported it --",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: -- As a lawmaker, supported the program --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Trump signed it into law.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: And he signed it into law. This shows how incompetent Hegseth is. That in his slash and burn efforts at the Pentagon, he basically slashed and burned something without realizing that this was actually a Trump era law, and this was led by his colleagues, and now he can't back out of it. This came out of, really, some of the lessons we learned in Afghanistan when we had the Marine Corps Lionesses, which were teams of all women Marines, tough, tough fighters, who would go in and talk to the women in the villages and would get intelligence that no one else could --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- because the women wouldn't talk to men.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: -- because women wouldn't talk to the men. And so this is, this is a vital program that keeps our military stronger and also makes it more lethal because we can find where our enemies are and go after them. And so to willingly go in and tie the hands of our troops, you know so that they can't do their jobs, is yet another example of a failure by the Secretary of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Hegseth said he'll implement the minimum required. What does that mean? Do you know?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: I don't know but he's the minimum of a Defense Secretary, so it's not surprising that he would go to the lowest levels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening within your party. Your fellow Midwesterner, Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin said Democrats are messaging in a way that doesn't resonate outside of blue coastal areas. She was focusing in on Bernie Sanders' use of the term oligarchy. She said use plain language, talk about kings that we oppose them. Do you agree with her that there is at minimum a messaging problem if there isn't something more within your party right now?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well I've long said that we should be listening to Midwest Democrats a lot more. Those of us from the center of the country, you know, represent states like Illinois, where 102 counties, 96 are red and six are blue. You know, you don't get elected in the Midwest without being able to talk to everyday voters in red counties about the issues that they worry about. To be able to talk about agricultural issues. You know, our farmers are just being battered by the Trump administration right now. The tariffs are hurting them with the products they're trying to sell, the input that they're trying to import in order to plant and grow their crops are being priced out of range. The steel that John Deere uses to make the tractors are also pricing those, that equipment out of range. I do think that, you know, the Democratic Party should be listening to the industrial Midwest more. I was so pleased we had the convention in Chicago and we were able to get that message out. Our own governor, JB Pritzker, is really out there talking a lot about issues that Democrats care deeply about, and Americans, not just Democrats, Americans care deeply about. You know, the your grocery store, prices at the grocery store, the price of the gas that goes in your tank. The fact that this administration is going to cut the LIHEAP Program, which is a program that funds low income housing and heating for rural communities is something that we should be talking more about. That's what people care about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your governor called for mass protests.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And he was out there arguing, as someone who is a billionaire, that, that people need to be out there more themselves and more vocal within the party. He talked about Democrats with a lack of guts and gumption. We're 18 months out from the midterms. Can Democrats get a strategy in place, and when?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Definitely, definitely. And this is why you're seeing us, for example, I went into Iowa and met with the Iowa, with the Chamber of Commerce across the river from the Mississippi because they're not being adequately represented by their own representation. You're seeing Democrats go into Republican areas. Republicans are running away from town halls because the population is just so upset with them. They're going after veterans. They're cutting veterans' benefits. And you're seeing Democrats go and do town halls in Republican districts in the House and now also in the Senate. And we're traveling across the entire country talking to people about the issues that really they care most deeply about, which is their children's education, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, all these programs are under the chopping block by this administration that is not keeping its promises to the American people. At the same time, they're simultaneously making America weaker on a global scale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to be doing that yourself?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: I'm already doing it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Out there campaigning for the party?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: I'm already \u2013 well no, I'm campaigning for the American people. I'm campaigning for my constituencies, the people who care deeply about national security but also want to make sure that they can afford a dozen eggs when they go grocery shopping for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Thank you.",

      "\"Employees charged with modernizing government information systems and routing out fraud, waste, and abuse in data systems plainly need access to those systems,\" he wrote. \"Yet the district court instead viewed agency employees within the SSA DOGE team as the equivalent of intruders who break into hotel rooms.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in at least a dozen cases, as more than 200 legal challenges targeting many aspects of second-term agenda move their way through the federal courts. But the legal battle over DOGE's access to Social Security data is the first directly involving the cost-cutting task force to land before the justices.",
      "President Trump\u00a0established DOGE\u00a0on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with leading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, U.S. Digital Service, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's attempts to access Americans' sensitive data at agencies including the Departments of Treasury and Education, and the Office of Personnel Management, have led to their own set of lawsuits claiming the task force's members have not been complying with the Privacy Act, the federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information.",
      "Musk's role in DOGE, too, has sparked a set of challenges that argue his actions violate the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A different federal judge in Maryland ruled in March that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution through its unilateral shut down of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to pause that decision while it considers an appeal by the Trump administration.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's budget proposal would cut 22% of non-defense discretionary spending next year while significantly increasing defense spending, according to a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget and information provided by the White House.",
      "The president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, the official told reporters on a conference call Friday, while defense spending would surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever. The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\"This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy that you have heard and seen such action from our administration with DOGE to be able to deal with the bureaucracy that we believe has grown up over many years to be entrenched against the interests of the American people,\" the senior OMB official told reporters on a conference call Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "The president's proposed budget would put all discretionary spending at $1.7 trillion, down from $1.83 trillion in the current fiscal year, and increase defense spending by 13%, the official said. The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said.",
      "The White House isn't yet saying what their deficit or revenue projections will be. The president's recommendation is in the hands of the Republican-controlled Congress, which is responsible for crafting and passing a budget.",
      "On average, agencies would see about 35% in cuts, although some entities, like the Department of Homeland Security, would see more funding under the proposal. Entities including the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services would see significant cuts under the president's proposal.",
      "The senior OMB official said the president's budget proposal includes \"an enormous cut to foreign aid, but one that still preserves substantial presence\" to provide for \"targeted\" aid when it's in the interest of the United States.",
      "But spending on things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to be the biggest drivers of the federal deficit and national debt, and those programs, along with interest on the debt, are taking up an increasingly large piece of the federal spending pie.",
      "A senior administration official said the president has been \"very, very involved\" in the budget proposal process.",
      "\"Obviously, this president's budget, he's very, very involved throughout the process,\" the official told reporters on the conference call, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We had four years of budgets to build on and come into office, see the damage that the Biden administration has wrecked on our fiscal house, and to make updates and incorporate many of the changes that have been identified from DOGE and come to you with a proposal.\"",

      "The satellite, named Biomass, launched with a rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, New Guinea, and separated from the rocket less than an hour after launch,\u00a0 the ESA said in a news release. About 75 minutes after the launch, ESA satellite controllers received Biomass' first signal, indicating that the satellite is working as expected in orbit.",
      "Over the next few days, controllers will carry out the satellite's \"launch and early orbit\" phase, making sure that all systems are working well, the ESA said, and the satellite will make a \"series of intricate maneuvers\" to deploy a nearly 40-foot-wide mesh reflector. That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",
      "\"With Biomass, we are poised to gain vital new data on how much carbon is stored in the world's forests, helping to fill key gaps in our knowledge of the carbon cycle and, ultimately, Earth's climate system,\" said Simonetta Cheli, the ESA's director of Earth observation programs.",

    "story": [
      "For nearly a decade, Bree Smith was a familiar face in Nashville. But, in January, the mom and former TV meteorologist stopped appearing on the local CBS-affiliated station \u2014 a decision she made after months of fighting against deepfakes, which are simulated online images or videos that can seem realistic.",
      "In Smith's case, an image of her was doctored to create explicit pictures and videos, with her face edited onto different, partly nude bodies, and then used to try to extort money from others. \"Sextortion\" scams like this one have targeted tens of thousands of Americans in the past year alone, according to the FBI.",
      "\"I cry myself to sleep most nights, mostly because I don't want my kids to see me,\" said Smith, who is 43. She recalled first learning about the images in an email, which included a screen grab of an exchange between the sender and an \"impersonator\" posing as the doctored version of her on the internet.",
      "The deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars, and targeting anyone who might recognize Smith. She began to keep track of new accounts using the deepfake in a Google spreadsheet \u2014 and added 24 over the course of just one week, among hundreds that she says have emerged online. A fabricated video also surfaced where a deepfake claims to be Smith.",
      "\"You're basically taking someone's identity,\" she said. \"You're weaponizing them.\"",
      "Smith has become a vocal advocate for regulations that could empower sextortion victims to fight back against their offenders. And last week, a bill Smith backed passed in the Tennessee Senate. The bill, called the \"Preventing Deepfake Images Act,\" was sent to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is expected to sign it into law. It provides a path for people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent.",
      "\"These imposters are trying to take my story, and my story is mine,\" Smith said. \"This is my life. I'm 43 years old and I have worked hard and I have loved well, and I'm not going to just roll over and take this.\"",
      "She said \"defining it as illegal is a critical first step,\" but that work still needs to be done, such as figuring out how to stop it and hold people accountable.",
      "As the bill worked its way through the Tennessee legislature, Smith appeared last month before the Tennessee House Criminal Justice Subcommittee to share her experience with deepfakes and the ways in which the scam has impacted her and her family. In her testimony to lawmakers, she said deepfake accounts pretending to be her have shown up on Facebook and Instagram, in quantities too large for her to find and report as an individual person, CBS News affiliate WSMV reported.",
      "\"I try my best to catch the imposters and block them, but like I said, there have been hundreds of them. It's like whack a mole, they just appear everywhere,\" Smith told lawmakers. \"I'm just supposed to look at them and say, 'nothing we can do, bud?'\"",
      "There were over 34,000 victims of sextortion in 2023, according to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. That number climbed to more than 54,000 victims last year. The FBI said financial sextortion, which differs from typical sextortion as it involves an offender threatening to release explicit material unless a payment is met, has been on the rise in the U.S. and targeting minors.",
      "Hayley Elizondo, who tracks sextortion crimes at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said financial gain is the perpetrators' primary goal.",
      "\"These offenders, their whole game is to make money,\" she said. \"I'm not surprised that we are seeing adults also become the target of financial sextortion. Frankly, they're going to reach out to those who can pay them.\"",
      "Officials say the most important thing for people to do if they think they are a victim of deepfakes is to report them.",
      "\"If you come across deepfake content that involves you or someone you know, report it to the platform hosting the content,\" says the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a nonprofit organization. \"This can help in having it removed or investigated, limiting its potential reach.\"",

    "summary": "Key questions remain about the cause, how much oil was released and the extent of the spill's impacts.",
    "story": [
      "After more than a week of oil shooting vertically out of an unused well off the coast of Louisiana, the U.S. Coast Guard announced Sunday evening that the offshore well blowout \u2014 first reported on April 26 \u2014 has been controlled.",
      "The well had been leaking oil and natural gas in a 30 to 40-foot-high \"geyser of oil,\" as one witness described, contaminating nearby marshland and protected Gulf Coast habitats, and prompting a large-scale emergency response.",
      "\"Gaining control of the discharge is a vital milestone, but it marks only the beginning of our work. The Unified Command is fully committed to an exhaustive cleanup effort and will remain on site for as long as necessary to ensure the removal of oil and the safety of both the community and the ecosystem,\" said U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Greg Callaghan,, a federal on-scene coordinator who was monitoring the leak.",
      "The federal government assumed control of the response effort on Thursday, with the Coast Guard taking over coordination from Spectrum Opco, the company operating the well, along with the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office. Cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing, involving National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Coast Guard and multiple state and local agencies, as well as private contractors hired by the owner of the well.",
      "The Coast Guard said one \"oiled bird\" had been spotted near the spill site, but had not been captured. The agency said no other wildlife impacts have yet been reported. However, federal maps online indicate pollutants have drifted into a protected area for endangered sea turtles.",
      "NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration, which provides scientific support during oil and chemical spills, has recently seen a drastic reduction in staffing. According to former employees who spoke with CBS News, that office alone lost 30 of its 85 staff members following cost-cutting measures the Trump administration implemented under the White House's Department of Government Efficiency initiative.",
      "The Office of Response and Restoration staff members respond to about 150 incidents a year and provide training to around 1,000 individuals from government and private businesses on \"the scientific aspects of oil and chemical spill response,\" according to its website. Former federal disaster response specialists and national environmental groups are concerned about the program office's ability to have the capacity to continue that mission and respond to emergencies like the Louisiana oil spill. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pushed to expand offshore oil drilling and accelerate the permitting process, reducing timelines from the current one- to two-year to just weeks.",
      "Authorities have not released information about the cause of the blowout or the total volume of oil released into the Louisiana Gulf Coast's marshlands. However, a report filed with the Coast Guard's National Response Center stated that \"the amount discharged could potentially reach the threshold of a major spill for coastal waters\u2014over 100,000 gallons.\" The report was made publicly available by the nonprofit watchdog group SkyTruth that monitors environmental hazards around the world using satellite images.",
      "So far, the Coast Guard says it has collected about 70,000 gallons of an oily watery mixture from the spill area.",
      "The incident highlights a broader challenge faced by Louisiana and other states: the growing problem of orphaned and aging oil wells. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $4.7 billion to cap orphan wells nationwide. Louisiana received $25 million, which allowed the state to plug 500 wells \u2014 though more than 4,000 are estimated to still be uncapped, according to the state. They are expected to receive $86 million more in the coming years \u2014 potentially leaving more than half of the state's uncapped wells more vulnerable to incidents like the current spill in Garden Island Bay.",
      "This particular well, known as Well #59, was not abandoned, but according to the Coast Guard, it had not had measurable oil pressure since the 1990s. The Coast Guard says it was secured when it was closed from use in 2016.",
      "\"The well was secured via closing the valves \u2026 (and) no cement was poured or injected to plug and abandon the well at that time,\" Coast Guard public information officer Phillip Vanderweit said.",
      "Due to the remote nature of the spill site, among other challenges, it took about a week for capping equipment to arrive on scene. Oil sprayed for eight recorded days until the leak was capped Sunday.",
      "Community members of the nearest inhabitable land to the spill site in Plaquemines Parish tell CBS News leaks like the Well #59 incident happen frequently, and that many oil leaks can continue to spill for quite some time, until a passerby happens to see them.",
      "A recent study estimates there are more than 14,000 unplugged oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico alone.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said he doesn't know if everyone in the U.S., citizens or non-citizens, is entitled to due process \u2014 the constitutional command stated in both the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment.",
      "\"I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News' Kristen Welker on \"Meet the Press\" after she asked him whether he agreed that everyone on U.S. soil is entitled to due process in the court of law.",
      "When asked by Welker in the interview aired Sunday if he thinks he has to uphold the Constitution as president, Mr. Trump also said, \"I don't know.\"",
      "\"I have to respond by saying again, and I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "His comments come as he discussed the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the El Salvadoran native who is married to a U.S. citizen and was living in Maryland before the Trump administration\u00a0mistakenly deported him in March. Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted in a court filing that the deportation of the Baltimore father was an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Last month, a federal judge and the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the U.S., but Abrego Garcia remains in a detention facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, after spending almost a month at the country's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).",
      "When asked about the delay in returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and whether he's defying the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump told NBC that Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department had interpreted the court's 9-0 decision differently.",
      "\"They're not viewing the decision the way you said it. They don't view it that way at all. They think it's a totally different decision,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have the power to ask for him to come back if I'm instructed by the attorney general  that it's legal to do so,\" the president added. \"But the decision as to whether or not he should come back will be  the head of El Salvador. He's a very capable man.\"",
      "President Nayib Bukele has said he won't return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. During his visit to the White House last month, Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said, \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said in the interview that aired Sunday that there's a possibility that the Department of Justice will go back to the Supreme Court and ask the justices to clarify their order to the administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return. The president and the Justice Department have said that Abrego Garcia shouldn't be in the country because of his alleged involvement with MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration, including its \"border czar\" Tom Homan, claimed that Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos are among \"one of many\" proofs that he's involved with the gang.",
      "\"He seems certainly like a very  dangerous, very bad person,\" the president told Welker, referencing the audio released last week by the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security of Abrego Garcia's wife when she filed a protective order against him in 2020, alleging domestic violence.",
      "Jennifer Vasquez also filed another protective order against him back in 2021 over allegations of domestic violence, according to court records obtained by CBS News. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "Since Abrego Garcia's deportation, Vasquez has been outspoken in support of his return. At a rally outside the White House on Thursday, she said her husband \"was thrown away to die.\"",
      "\"My children and I had to watch Trump and Bukele's administration laugh at our pain,\" Vasquez said. \"The highest court ruled that Kilmar should be returned home. So why are they still waiting? Enough is enough.\"",

      "President Trump said Sunday he is directing his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on an island near San Francisco, California.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Mr. Trump wrote that, \"For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm.

      "\"The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order and JUSTICE,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told the Associated Press in a statement that the agency \"will comply with all Presidential Orders.\" The spokesperson did not immediately answer the AP's questions regarding the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz or the agency's role in the future of the former prison given the National Park Service's control of the island.",
      "Mr. Trump's social media post comes as he has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without due process. Mr. Trump has also talked about wanting to send American citizens there and to other foreign prisons.",
      "Mr. Trump, returning to the White House on Sunday night, told reporters he came up with the idea because of frustrations with \"radicalized judges\" who have insisted those being deported receive due process.",
      "What was Alcatraz prison?",
      "Alcatraz prison, located on Alcatraz Island located just over a mile north of San Francisco, was a maximum-security, minimum-privilege prison opened in 1934 to deal with the \"most incorrigible inmates in federal prisons,\" the Bureau of Prisons says.",
      "It was also to \"show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant crime of the 1920s and 1930s,\" the Bureau said on its website.",
      "Well-known criminals such as Al Capone, George \"Machine-Gun\" Kelly, Alvin Karpis (the first \"Public Enemy No. 1) and Arthur \"Doc\" Barker did time in Alcatraz, according to the BOP. However, most of the prisoners were not infamous gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules and regulations of other federal institutions.",
      "Alcatraz had a capacity of 336 prisoners, though the average population was only about 260 to 275 at any given time.",
      "Over the 29 years that it operated, 36 men were involved in 14 separate escape attempts. Of these, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed and two drowned.",
      "It closed on March 21, 1963, because the prison was too expensive to continue to operate, the BOP said.",
      "After it closed, it was basically abandoned. In 1969, a group of Native American Indians occupied Alcatraz for 18 months, claiming it as Indian land.",
      "Can people visit Alcatraz?",
      "After its closure, the prison was often portrayed as \"America's Devil's Island\" in books and movies, including \"The Rock\" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" starring Clint Eastwood.",
      "In 1972, Congress created the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the island where Alcatraz sits on was included as part of a new National Park Service site. The island opened to tourists in the fall of 1973 and has become one of the most popular National Park Service sites.",
      "Alcatraz Island continues to operate as a tourist site to this day.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes the island, questioned the feasibility of reopening the prison after so many years.",

    "summary": "Cheaper goods from China are no longer exempt from import duties, which could sharply raise prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "Temu, for one, announced a dramatic shift to its business model. \"All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarwab, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",

      "As for Greenland, the president said when asked to clarify whether he would rule out using military force on the territory that \"I don't rule it out, I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything, no \u2014 not there.\"",
      "\"We need Greenland very badly,\" he added. \"Greenland is a very small amount of people we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them and all of that, but we need that for international security.\"",
      "Located between the U.S., Russia and Europe, Greenland is viewed as a strategic position for both economic and defense purposes, with melting sea ice opening up new shipping routes through the Arctic. Greenland's prime minister has pushed back sharply against Mr. Trump's threats, saying in March that \"we are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "In the wide-ranging hourlong interview with \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Trump waffled on whether the thinks he needs to \"uphold the Constitution.\"",
      "\"I don't know. I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what Supreme Court said,\" Mr. Trump said regarding due process for immigrants sent to a prison in El Salvador.",

    "summary": "PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Sunday that \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" after President Trump last week ordered a cut off to federal funding to PBS and NPR.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Sunday that \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" after President Trump issued an executive order last week aimed at cutting federal funding to the two major public broadcasting systems \u2014 PBS and NPR.",
      "\"This is different. They're coming after us on many different ways,\" Kerger said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. The executive order dictates that the government \"shall cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, consistent with my Administration's policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.\"",
      "Kerger said it's one of a number of avenues where the administration is \"coming after us,\" including with a possible rescission of already appropriated funds, and an effort to challenge sponsorships from corporations through the Federal Communications Commission, among other things.",
      "\"Obviously we're going to be pushing back very hard, because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations, across the country,\" Kerger said.",
      "Kerger said PBS gets 15% of its funding from the federal government, but said that figure is an aggregate number, with some stations in small communities receiving up to 40% or 50% of their funding from the government. For them, she said \"it's existential,\" adding \"that's what's at risk if this funding goes away.\"",
      "Among the funding that Kerger said she expects to be impacted is funding from the Department of Education, which she said has supported the creation of children's programming and the research behind its educational components. Kerger said the programming was created because not all children have access to formal pre-kindergarten.",
      "\"That was the idea with Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers, and everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool,\" Kerger said. \"That's what's at risk.\"",
      "NPR CEO Katherine Maher also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and said \"we're looking at whatever options are available to us\" to challenge the executive order. Maher echoed that the \"immediate damage is to local stations,\" while noting that other scenarios, like a clawback of already appropriated funds, or if stations were no longer able to participate in their membership dues, would be \"damaging.\"",
      "\"The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities,\" Maher said, noting that there are 246 stations throughout the country, and for some Americans, they provide the sole local source of news.",
      "The executive order says \"Americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage,\" while arguing that government funding for news media is \"not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\" The order claims that neither PBS nor NPR present \"a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\"",
      "Maher, who noted that she doesn't personally make editorial decisions, said in response to the suggestion that NPR is not fair and non-partisan that \"I think our newsroom would really take issue with that.\"",
      "\"We have been on air for more than 50 years. We have been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, overseas,\" Maher said. \"We have an extraordinary Washington desk, and our people report straight down the line, and I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting.\"",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump begins the next phase of his agenda with a staff shakeup. And what does the economic deal between the U.S. and Ukraine mean for the security relationship between the two countries?",
      "Mike Waltz is out as national security adviser, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in, adding another job to his growing list of responsibilities.",
      "With Trump's push for a nuclear deal with Iran and an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, we will ask Republican Mike Turner about the impact of the shuffle. And we will get insights from one of Trump's national security advisers in his first term, retired Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster.",

      "And, finally, as President Trump seeks to end federal funding to public broadcasting, we will ask NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger how they plan to fight back.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We have a lot to get to, so let's begin today with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Good to see you here in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I have a lot of national security topics to get to you, but at the heart of so much is America's economic strength. And so I want to ask you about what President Trump said this week about the cost, the impact of his China tariffs on the supply of goods in the United States.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls, instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your constituents back in Ohio really want to hear the message that they need fewer Christmas presents this year?",
      "He's acknowledging less supply, higher prices.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think there's going to be a lot that has to be shaken out here. And we certainly are seeing, I think, some reaction now in China also that means that the president's goal is that these nations, that \u2013 of which he's putting tariffs on the table and tariffs, which are a punishment for having behaved poorly, taking advantage of the United States economically, will come to the table and negotiate better economic deals than the United States has been experiencing.",
      "Those deals are beginning to be offered. The White House is beginning to negotiate those. China is beginning to signal that they're willing to come to the table. So, even though the president is making those statements, at the same time, we're seeing that the president taking that step of saying we want a better economic deal is beginning to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in the meantime, China said it may restrict exports of materials used by General Dynamics, which makes tanks, including in your state of Ohio. Are you concerned that the trade war won't just impact people's purchasing of toys, but preparedness, tanks, and military readiness?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think we're all concerned of the effects on the supply chain. And certainly we have got to make certain that this works through the entire processes and that we are concerned on the effects of the economy.",
      "I think the president's going to be looking at that. Congress is going to be looking at that. But the real concern here is that we do have to look long term as to how this protects our overall economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Beijing has not yet launched those talks. We will be watching for them if they do get under way.",
      "Let's get to the other news of the week, the reshuffling at the top of the national security apparatus. It has long been clear there are divides within the administration on certain topics. Iran is one of them. Russia is another one of them. Mike Waltz, who you served with, viewed as a traditional Republican hawk.",
      "I say this because, when he was on this program previously, he laid out in pretty clear terms that the U.S. goal in these negotiations with Iran are dismantlement of its nuclear program, not limits on enrichment, not verification, but those are the things that the envoy negotiating with Iran have said.",
      "We're seeing policy differences from within the president's own administration here. Has Congress been given details on what the goal is and what the plan is?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, the goal is simply stated, that we do not have a nuclear Iran.",
      "And, certainly, the president is leaning strongly in that. From his first term, with the maximum pressure campaign, the president was clear that, both in non-nuclear Iran and also making certain that we have \u2013 that the nefarious activities of Iran working through their proxies, the terrorist groups and organizations, that that be stopped.",
      "So the president is very strong on an anti-Iran policy, including ensuring that there not be a nuclear Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the things that his envoy have described sound a lot like that 2015 nuclear deal negotiated under President Obama, with limits on enrichment, for example, and things like that.",
      "I know in the past you voted for legislation that would give Congress more oversight over a deal with Iran. Do you expect President Trump to bring any kind of deal he brokers to Congress for approval?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think we have to see what the deal is.",
      "I mean, currently, there's just ongoing negotiations. We will have to see how that evolves. We will have to see what those terms are and really \u2013 well, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want any kind of review regardless?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I mean, as it evolves, we will have to see what those terms are and what \u2013 and really what is achieved.",
      "And, certainly, there's a role for Congress to play as that goes forward. But I think we need to give them the opportunity for success.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Israeli prime minister issued a statement yesterday denying that he personally was talking to Mike Waltz about bombing Iran, military action against Iran. Of course, we know his aides could have those conversations.",
      "Is it appropriate work for the national security adviser to the president to be coordinating with Israel about military action against Iran, or was Mike Waltz possibly in the wrong here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, first off, we don't know specifically that that was occurring.",
      "But, at the same time, the National Security Council, the function of the National Security Council is to ensure that the president of the United States has the greatest information possible. And Mike Waltz is \u2013 has an incredible background and experience. He worked diligently to make certain he had a strong role in the national security team of the president.",
      "And I'm certainly glad that he's going to be retained and staying in a strong role in this administration. Working directly with world leaders and heads of state is certainly an important role of \u2013 as the national security adviser to the president. And I \u2013 certainly, I think, even as U.N. ambassador, he will continue to do that type of function.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it in the national security interest, though, to have the secretary of state, who also has, at least on paper, three other jobs now, in this role, and for how long?",
      "You're saying how important it is.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, it certainly \u2013 certainly, we know Henry Kissinger has been in that position before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And even he said it was untenable.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And even \u2013 but he was in lockstep with his president.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think what's also very important here is that Marco Rubio, from a policy perspective, is very strong in this administration. His signal of being in this position sends a signal of continuing the same policies in the administration.",
      "From a Trump team policy perspective, him taking over this sends a signal of continuation and strength. That's excellent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the policy\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Now we have got to give him the opportunity of, is he going to be able to build out the team in the National Security Council?",
      "And that's certainly hope \u2013 hopefully that he will be able to do so and build out a strong team there that represents really the opportunity to support President Trump in giving him the information and knowledge and the access to information and knowledge that he needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a diplomatic way of saying there shouldn't be loyalty tests to the president. You want actual experts staffing National Security Council. You don't want Laura Loomer, a far right activist, making decisions on personnel?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, at the same time, there does have to be loyalty to the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course, but also to the Constitution.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I mean, we saw in the president's first term that the president was betrayed during the first Trump impeachment by individuals who were at the National Security Council.",
      "So Trump personally has an understanding that you have to have people at the National Security Council that are on Trump's team. And the National Security Council, being \u2013 directly working with him and being in the White House, it's very, very important that they be personnel that work for and on behalf of the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about National Security Council members who testified under oath that the president was withholding aid to Ukraine during the first administration for a political favor.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And was shown to have wrongly been testified, because I was part of that panel. And they \u2013 their testimony was proven not to be accurate, that the president was not tying aid to Ukraine to the investigation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was the premise of the impeachment.",
      "But your point is, that looms large in the president's memory and interaction with the National Security Council now. OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: The president needs to make certain that he has staff that are supportive of him in the National Security Council and his policies and makes certain that they're providing him information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This is the heart of, what does the president know that our adversaries are doing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: When he's dealing with Russia and what \u2013 and policies with respect to Ukraine, he needs to know what Vladimir Putin is doing. And that's coming directly from the National Security Council.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.",
      "The White House budget was released Friday. It is not the trillion-dollar promise the president campaigned on. Susan Collins on Appropriations, Roger Wicker on the Senate Armed Services Committee says this is not adequate. And, in fact, he said: \"The intention is to shred to the bone our military capabilities and support to service members.\"",
      "Do you share your Republican senators' concerns?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think there's more work that can be done on the national security portion of the president's budget.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would like to see more defense spending than the White House is putting forth?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think there's going to be more debate and I think there's more opportunity for increased investment.",
      "We really need to do more in the national security space. There are adversaries that we have that want to do America harm, and we need to be strong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman Turner, thank you for joining us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth.",
      "Good to have you here in person.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, I know you did vote to confirm Secretary Rubio. Do you have confidence that he can juggle all four of the jobs that he now has for an indefinite period of time?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: No. There's no way he can do that and do it well, especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD with Pete Hegseth being secretary of defense, and just the hollowing out of the top leadership.",
      "There's no way he can carry all that entire load on his own. And so I do think that they need to find a new secretary of defense. They need to find a new NSA \u2013 head of NSA as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, at this point, we heard from the chief of staff that she believes all the Cabinet secretaries will serve a full year. What makes you think that Secretary Hegseth could actually be dismissed?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think he should be dismissed.",
      "Whether or not President Trump's going to dismiss him is a whole different conversation. He should never have been nominated in the first place. He is the most untrained, inadequate secretary of defense in our nation's history. And look at what he's done at the Pentagon. It's in turmoil.",
      "He lost his top staffers within a matter of days. He's now put classified information an unclassified chain, and he's put on our nation's national security at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says no war plans, wasn't classified, but it was sensitive information. That's part of this ongoing inspector general probe, as I understand it, into his conduct.",
      "Do you have any timeline, any sense of how seriously that's being taken and when the results will be seen?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: We don't have a timeline. It is very serious.",
      "Let me make it clear what he did. He put into an unclassified Signal chain that the aircraft are going to be over a certain point in space at a certain point in time. That's classified information. Any basic person getting through military training knows that is classified information.",
      "And he did it on a separate chain with his wife and family members.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because you sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Armed Services\u2026",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Armed Services, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 what you think is going to happen to Mike Waltz, who is now being pushed out of the NSA role and into this job as ambassador to the United Nations. That's arguably a pretty important post.",
      "Senate Intel Vice Chairman Mark Warner says it's going to be a brutal hearing. What do you want to know from him? And are you open to confirming him into the job?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: It will be a brutal hearing. He's not qualified for the job, just by nature of the fact that he participated in the Signal chain.",
      "In fact, I think everybody on that Signal chain needs to be fired, because not a single one of them spoke up and said, hey, this is inappropriate. We should be in a secure channel.",
      "And, by the way, what's really interesting was that there was not a single uniformed personnel on that Signal chain, which was very clear that it was purposefully done to keep the military personnel with the experience off of that Signal chat.",
      "Now, Mike Waltz is doing what we call, he is failing up, right? He is failing in his job and getting promoted to be ambassador. That's not what our nation needs at the United Nations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Waltz served this country in a uniform as a Green Beret. He was a lawmaker. You think he is incompetent, and you're not open to voting for him at all?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: I'm not open to voting for him, no, because he \u2013 because he's already demonstrated he's incapable of doing the most basic thing, which is handling classified information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about funding for defense because I know you have said, in particular, the Navy needs more money and more financial support right now.",
      "The Republican chair of Appropriations and the Republican chair of Armed Services both saw the White House's budget when it was released on Friday\u2026",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and said it freezes military spending at Biden era levels, which they argue amounts to a reduction.",
      "Can you work together with your Republican allies to increase defense spending?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, one of the places where there has been bipartisanship has been the Armed Services Committee. That has been something that I have been very proud to be a part of.",
      "Now, whether or not my Republican colleagues continue to be co-conspirators and collaborators with this administration in basically gutting the United States government is up to them. Right now, their plans are going to require laying off hundreds \u2013 at least 100,000 civilian workers at the Pentagon.",
      "It's going to, in the words of Chairman Wicker, basically \u2013 I'm going to paraphrase him \u2013 cut defense capabilities to the bone, I think is how he put it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, he did.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: We need to make sure \u2013 the Navy needs more ships. We need more \u2013 and the Merchant Mariners need more boats, more ships. We need to make major investments in our sixth-generation fighter fleet. We need to make major investments in training pilots.",
      "We are short pilots. And yet the cuts that they're proposing in order to fund a vanity project like the Golden Dome does not help make America more secure on a global scale. And it certainly doesn't keep us the leader of the free world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about one of the programs that is at least nominally being eliminated. Secretary Hegseth posted on social media he's ending the Women, Peace, and Security program.",
      "Hegseth said: \"It's a divisive social justice initiative from feminists, a distraction from war fighting.\"",
      "But when we checked how the now-chairman of the Joint Chiefs described it, General Caine, he said he used the program in the field after an assault to send in female members to speak with women and children to better understand human terrain.",
      "So, if the military establishment says it's useful and the secretary of defense says it's not and it's a distraction, what happens? And can lawmakers like yourself actually rescue this program?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: We can if my Republicans will stop rolling over for this president. We can actually rescue this program. The program is clearly important. It's supported by every combatant commander. It's a program that came about \u2013 by the way, Marco Rubio was one of the leaders of this. But\u2026",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was. And Kristi Noem as a lawmaker supported it.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: And Kristi Noem as a lawmaker supported the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Trump signed it into law.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: And he signed it into law.",
      "This shows how incompetent Hegseth is, that in his slash-and-burn efforts at the Pentagon, he basically slash and burned something without realizing that this was actually a Trump era law and this was led by his colleagues. And now he can't back out of it.",
      "This came out of really some of the lessons we learned in Afghanistan when we had the Marine Corps Lionesses, which were teams of all women Marines, tough, tough fighters, who would go in and talk to the women in the villages and would get intelligence that no one else could.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the women wouldn't talk to the men.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Because women wouldn't talk to the men.",
      "And so this is a vital program that keeps our military stronger and also makes it more lethal, because we can find where our enemies are and go after them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Hegseth said he will implement the minimum required of - - what does that mean? Do you know?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: I don't know. But he's the minimum of a defense secretary, so it's not surprising that he would go to the lowest levels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening within your party.",
      "Your fellow Midwesterner Michigan Senator Elisha Slot kin said Democrats are messaging in a way that doesn't resonate outside of blue coastal areas. She was focusing in on Bernie Sanders' use of the term oligarchy. She said, use plain language. Talk about kings, that we oppose them.",
      "Do you agree with her that there is at minimum a messaging problem, if there isn't something more within your party right now?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I have long said that we should be listening to Midwest Democrats a lot more. Those of us from the center of the country represent states like Illinois. We're 102 counties; 96 are red and six are blue.",
      "You don't get elected in the Midwest without being able to talk to everyday voters in red counties about the issues that they worry about. Do \u2013 be able to talk about agricultural issues. Our farmers are just being battered by the Trump administration right now. The tariffs are hurting them with the products they're trying to sell. The inputs that they're trying to import in order to plan and grow their crops are being priced out of range.",
      "The steel that John Deere uses to make the tractors are also pricing those \u2013 that equipment out of range. I do think that the Democratic Party should be listening to the Industrial Midwest more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us.",

      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "Yes, another very difficult day and night in Kyiv, and not only Kyiv, Chafee and some other places. More than 165 Shahed drones, Iranian drones, have been deployed again against completely civilian targets. So, unfortunately, this is a horrible reality during the past 1,166 days.",
      "Every day, regardless of Russia says, there are some attacks, and there are civilian casualties and there are civilian destructions. And for the same 1,166 days, we work diligently on getting \u2013 not only defending us, but getting to peace. And Ukraine is devoted to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been a shift in tone at least between the Trump administration and your president.",
      "President Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that his conversation with President Trump at the pope's funeral was the best meeting they've ever had and he's confident things will look different now.",
      "What is he indicating? What's coming next? When do they speak next?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Look, our partnership with the U.S. is very important for us.",
      "U.S. has been and is a strategic partnership. We are really grateful to American people for all the support that we are getting from the U.S. It would not be possible for us to defend ourselves without those Javelins, without those weapons that U.S. has provided us.",
      "And it was President Trump who decided to provide us Javelins as \u2013 when I was still a finance minister.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: And it was back in 2017.",
      "And then large support from American people during the past three years have really been a game changer, and we are very grateful for it. The meeting was great. And, you know, as you know, after that meeting, we have signed really a great agreement, economic partnership agreement between our two nations, which will take that partnership to a new level.",
      "So, look, we might have some disagreements on \u2013 in some areas, but Ukraine is committed to peace. Ukraine wants peace more than anyone, and we need U.S. We \u2013 we \u2013 our countries are based on the same values. We are defending freedom in Ukraine. We are not the ones who started this war.",
      "And now it's not only the right or moral thing to do \u2013 to support Ukraine, but, also, U.S. has, as your secretary of treasury said, an interest, and specific economic interest, in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, I want to ask you about that deal. This is what's often described as a minerals agreement, but it's a broader economic partnership that's going forth for ratification in your government this week, I understand.",
      "This was agreed to, but Russia's foreign minister has said that the mineral deposits that exist in Ukraine in the east are one reason his country wouldn't withdraw from that area. So, can the U.S. and Ukraine make this deal work if Russian troops are still in the area where those mineral deposits largely are?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Margaret, as you said, this is an economic partnership agreement to create an investment fund to \u2013 for both of our nations to benefit from amazing investment opportunities that Ukraine has.",
      "We discussed before \u2013 and I'm so glad that we can not only discuss the horrible tragedy and destruction brought by a Russian unprovoked invasion, but also of the bright future that we, together with America and \u2013 and other countries, can have.",
      "Ukraine has agricultural land and black soil. And with the technologies, even during the war, we feed more than 400 million people. We have energy. We have mineral \u2013 critical mineral deposits. We have so much in the \u2013 including the human talent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: And we can develop it together.",
      "So, look, when Russians criticize something, it's a sign for all of us that we are doing something right.",

      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: This deal will work, and it will work if Ukraine is peaceful.",

      "We return now to our conversation with Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova.",
      "We've been discussing the deal that the United States and Ukraine came to in regard to this economic partnership. I've read that the deal counts future U.S. military assistance in the form of ammunition, weapon systems and training as a contribution to the investment fund, and that Ukraine will not reimburse Washington for past military aid. Is that how it's set up?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador): Well, we - first of all, it's important that it's going to be, as we say, a 50/50 deal. So we, together, will set up that fund, we will run it together. And all the future contribution that - or investments that U.S. will be providing us, including military deals, will be counted as contribution to that fund, and Ukraine will be also committing the proceeds from the new licenses and new developments into the fund. So, essentially, it's a true partnership where we would be able to put resources together in order to invest into a wide range of projects, including infrastructure, including rare earths, including critical minerals, and both of our nations will benefit from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When does that get up and running?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: We're working very actively on it. As you saw, the deal between the governments have been signed. It's going to be ratified by our parliament hopefully soon. You have seen strong messages from President Zelenskyy. And it's his vision and vision of President Trump behind the deal that is moving it forward.",
      "Of course, there will be the creation of the fund, the set-up of the fund. I used to work in private equity in my previous life. That takes a little bit of time. But we are moving very fast. So, hopefully the teams will come - put everything together and we'll start working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But within this there aren't security guarantees. Are there promises of future military aid from the United States? Because if this effort to get a peace deal together doesn't work, the fate of the war is still in question.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, you know, this - the situation with Russian aggression towards Ukraine is so complex. There are many - we've discussed the potential possible peace deals. We're discussing this economic partnership deal which is already signed. We're discussing other possible scenarios and security guarantees and involvement of other friends and allies. And, you know, Europe has been more active and proactive in a number of areas.",
      "So, this economic partnership deal in itself is a very important part of the broader security, security architecture, if I may say so. And, frankly, that fund will be successful if Ukraine is stable and peaceful. So, in a way, it's an important part of the future security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin told Russian state TV, he thinks that he can bring this war to a logical conclusion. He avoided the word war. He said this thing that started in 2022. But he said, here's been no need to use nuclear weapons and, quote, \"I hope they will not be required.\"",
      "How do you interpret that?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, it's very difficult to interpret a man and a so- called leader of the nation who attack Georgia in 2008, attacked Ukraine in 2014, conducted two genocidal wars on his own in his own federation against Chechnya, the war crimes in Syria, poisoned people in - in Great Britain. I mean, I think at this point it doesn't matter how we interpret what he says, we just have to believe what he says and understand what he says.",
      "He is a threat, not only to Ukraine, but also to anyone who believes that nations should live peacefully, do not challenge each other's borders and just focus on the economic operation. That's what we are doing with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: And hopefully our collective efforts and with Europe, with all the Baltic and Nordic states, with all the friends and allies, including Japan, including the U.K., including so many people that are coming together in order to bring peace, not only to our part of the world, but globally because it's important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Putin is doing it, together with Iran and North Korea. They are not hiding it. They are supporting other terroristic regimes. And we should also stay together in order to bring peace.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. He served as national security adviser during President Trump's first term, and he is the author of, \"At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House.\"",
      "Good to have you back with us.",
      "LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (Ret., Former Trump National Security Adviser): Hey, great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been here. Mike Waltz is no longer the national security adviser. CBS reported his deputy, Alex Wong, will also depart his role. But then, as of Friday morning, we found Wong was still on the job. It is not clear what the National Security Council makeup will be or how long the secretary of state will be at the head of it advising the president.",
      "What significance does this have for America's national security?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: I think it's significant, Margaret, because I think what it reveals is, is a fight that's going on within the administration associated with the - our role in the world and how certain people in the administration perceive America's role in the world. And I think Mike Waltz as an America first guy, but he was an internationalist and prioritized, I think, our alliances. He knew that, I think, that, quite correctly, that Putin won't stop until he is stopped. And so, he was an advocate for a strong approach to Putin. And I think there were those in the administration that have a much different world view, you know, who are in favor of - of U.S. retrenchment or disengagement from complex challenges abroad and want to prioritize kind of the western hemisphere/North American defense. And you see that in your discussion with - with Congressman Turner as well associated with the defense budget and what's being prioritized in the defense budget as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you see this as a - as a policy argument, not just a Signal messaging mistake that, you know, Mike Waltz created that channel where he accidentally included a reporter?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: It is. I think it's a - it's a policy issue, a world view issue, but it's also an understanding of the role of the - the national security council staff and the national security staff that - that - that Mike Waltz was running, and Alex Wong is - is still running. And - and that's really the staff that allows the president to drive his agenda, that gets best analysis, best advice to the president and gets him multiple options.",
      "It seems pretty clear that President Trump is not very patient in terms of a deliberative process these days, and this is why I think he may see the National Security Council staff as an impediment instead of really the best vehicle to drive his agenda and to integrate all elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to advance American interests.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, I thought it was an interesting point Congressman Turner made when he brought up the specific point of reference the president has for the National Security Council during his first term, which is, Turner argued, seeing them as the reason he was impeached where - during his first impeachment related to Ukraine. Do you think that is something that makes him distrust that counsel? Why is it that he would take the advice of someone like Laura Loomer, this far right activist who has made racist attacks on some of the members of that council?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: You know, Margaret, I think there are three times of people in any administration, those who are there to give the president best advice, those who are there not for that but want to manipulate decisions consistent with their own agenda. These are people inside and outside of the administration. And there's a third group of people who sometimes take on the role of maybe saving the country and the world from the president. That second and third group, if you have an effective national security decision-making process that gives the president multiple options, they tend to oppose that process. They tend to oppose the national security adviser.",
      "And I think what you're seeing is how easy it is for certain people to get in the president's ear, to sow distrust, to drive a wedge between him and the national security adviser in this case or the national security staff and those who are there to get him multiple options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced the different world view of some of the people advising the president right now. Particularly regarding our allies.",
      "In Europe, we saw an interesting decision this week in Germany. Their domestic intelligence agency concluded an investigation into a far-right political party known as AFD. They declared it to be an extremist group because of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim positions. Their leaders have trivialized the Holocaust. They've called for deporting non-white citizens because that violates the German constitution.",
      "This would sound like a domestic issue. However, the vice president and the secretary of state have taken very public statements here wading into this. Rubio calling it \"tyranny in disguise.\" Vice President Vance also weighing in here. Do you think that's advisable when that party's leaders have such a troubled history? Can you explain it?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: Yes, part - part of this, Margaret, is - is what you covered earlier in the show about this kind of women, peace and security initiative, as well as I would say some of the radical DEI agendas of the Biden and maybe the Obama administration before that. This is like an equal and opposite reaction. And it's international.",
      "And this is one of the reasons why there are some people in the United States who kind of regard Putin as - as - as the savior of - of western civilization, or - or Christianity and so forth, which is obviously kind of a - a perverse view of him as well.",
      "But I think what's related to this is this sort of - this emphasis on, you know, retrenchment, just take care of ourself, disengage from the world and - and I think that these are - are related. What's - what's, I think, interesting about this though is that the Trump administration, I think, risks replicating the flaws of the Obama administration's policy, because what you see is, now some people in the Republican Party seeing the source of all ills in the world as, like, the neocons and - and they trace it back in particular to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.",
      "So, that blaming ourselves, other Americans for the ills of the world, and the associated impulse toward disengagement risks recreating, I think, some of the fundamental flaws in sort of the Obama administration approach to the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, thank you for sharing your insight.",

      "KATHERINE MAHER (CEO, NPR): Thank you for having us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president issued this order for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which oversees you both, to cut off funding. Are you both filing lawsuits? And on what basis can you challenge this?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: We're looking at whatever options are available to us. I think it's a little preliminary for us to be able to speak to the specific strategies that we might take.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that the same for pbs?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Yes. We're, obviously, looking. And I would just say, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a funding mechanism, but they actually don't oversee PBS or NPR. We're independent organizations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Important point to make.",
      "But the threat of cutting off funding -",
      "PAULA KERGER: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Whether it was in Congress or the president saying he's doing it now. That's not new, right? That's been a talking point for years. There have been efforts in Congress. You do have funding, I think, through 2027, but it feels a little bit different this time. Do you have a backup funding plan?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Yes, it is different this time. And I've been through these battles now for a number of years. I've been at PBS almost 20 years. And I remember even going back to the Newt Gingrich days.",
      "But this is different. They're coming after us on many different ways. We're waiting for a possible rescission of those funds that have already been appropriated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're clawing them back.",
      "PAULA KERGER: There was an effort within the FCC challenging our ability to accept sponsorships from corporations, which is something that we have worked with the FCC on for many, many years. There was the executive order. There was the effort to try to remove a few members of the CPB board. So, we have never seen a circumstance like this. And, obviously, we're going to be pushing back very hard because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations across the country. We get 15 percent of our funding from the federal government. That's 1-5 percent, but that's an aggregate number. Some of our stations in small communities, it's 40 percent to 50 percent of their funding. And for them it's existential. And that's what's at risk if this funding goes away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is it immediate for NPR?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: In - in a similar fashion. If we were to see a claw back of these funds, which we know is part of the conversation from a rescission standpoint, or if we were to see that the stations were no longer able to participate in their membership due, that would be damaging.",
      "But I think that Paula's point is the one that really people need to hear. The immediate damage is to local stations. And with NPR we have stations in more than - 246 stations with newsrooms, we're in 200 newsrooms in every state in the country, and that includes journalists who are out there covering their local communities, especially in a time where we're seeing an advance of news deserts across the nation, 20 percent of Americans don't have access to another local source of news. The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president tweeted, or socialed, or truthed, \"Republicans must defund and totally disassociate themselves from NPR and PBS, the radical left monsters that so badly hurt our country.\"",
      "I have to tell you, I heard monsters and I thought of Cookie Monster.",
      "PAULA KERGER: I did too, actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought of \"Sesame Street\" and I thought of that children's programming.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is in many - many ways what people think of when they think of PBS.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely. (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that impacted too?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely. And out of this executive order, we believe it impacts our funding out of the Department of Education, which is a 30-year program that has supported the development - not only the creation of many of the children's programming that you see on public television, but also the research that we do to ensure that that programming is not just safe and enjoyable, but that children, after watching, come away with understanding of basic letters and numbers. Half the kids in this country are not enrolled in formal pre-k. That's why programming for children on public television was created. That was the idea with \"Sesame Street\" and \"Mister Rogers.\" And everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool. That may be at age two, or three, or four, and sometimes five, not until they start kindergarten. That's what's at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At risk or right now? I mean, do you have the money to keep functioning?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Well, we have programming, so you're not going to turn on your TV set and not see our children's programming anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "PAULA KERGER: But if that funding is cut off, we have programs in development right now. And that will suddenly skid to a halt. We also have stations around the country that work directly with preschool providers and parents, and this funds those activities. So, the immediate impact would be fairly significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Katherine, I want to ask you about the news. When we went and we read the executive order, the language in there says, \"government funding of news media in this environment is outdated and unnecessary, corrosive to the appearance of independence. Ad Americans have the right to expect if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting, that it's fair, accurate, unbiased and non-partisan.\"",
      "How do you respond to the implication that your news coverage is not?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Is not fair and - and non-partisan? I mean I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And unbiased.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Yes, I mean, well, first of all, I think it's important to note that I'm the CEO and we have an independent editor in chief who oversees the newsroom. And so, I don't make editorial decisions. And that, I think, is just always an important point to make.",
      "But I think our newsroom would really take issue with that. We have been on air for more than 50 years. We have been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, oversees. We have an extraordinary Washington desk. And our people report straight down the line. And I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting as we bring people together in those conversations.",
      "And so, we've had a whole host of conservative voices on air of late. We've been making requests of the Trump administration to have their officials on air. We would like to see more people accept those invitations. It's hard for us to be able to say we can speak for everyone when folks won't join us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that was the executive order. Then we went and we looked at the White House talking points and what they're putting on social media. They're a lot more about you than you. And on NPR they were saying things like, July 2022 editor's note that said the Declaration of Independent had offensive language against Native Americans. We checked, and the word \"savages\" is used. The White House faults your editors for avoiding the term \"biological sex\" when discussing transgender issues. They apparently want you to use the term \"pro-life\" and faulted your use of the term \"anti-abortion rights\" to refer to activists.",
      "So, when you see specific editorial criticisms like that, what do you interpret the intention of this being.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Well, I interpret the intention of this being - trying to create a narrative around our editorial independence. And as I said in our",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To control it and then (INAUDIBLE)?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: To control it. And I think that that's a - that is an affront to the First Amendment. We have an independent newsroom and we will always have an independent newsroom.",
      "From my perspective, part of the separation of - that the First Amendment offers to keep government out. In fact, the statute that was written when the Public Broadcasting Act was signed into law was very explicit about interference from any member of the government, whether it is elected officials, whether members of independent agencies, because it is so sacrosanct, that division between the state and independent media.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Set it up as a private corporation to give protection from influence and control. I would assume that's also from the White House, influence and control.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: That's right. And President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the bill into law creating public - the Public Broadcasting Act and creating the system that we all operate within, was - was very note - he noted in his remarks upon signing that speech was that it does requires a greater wisdom, and that's why we have a two-year advance appropriation is to - is to insulate both of our work from political interference. I think that that is critical that Americans understand that public broadcasting is meant to be independent so that we can serve the public interest regardless of whatever administration is in office or whatever Congress' whims are.",
      "PAULA KERGER: And the - and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was set up as a private corporation with that same intent. So, I think there was a lot of focus, even at that moment, in - when the act was signed that protections would need to be put in place, because if we do our job, it is - it is possible that we will produce content that some people may wish we have done a different way. And this way it gives us the independence this way.",
      "The other thing that keeps us independent is that most of our funding comes from viewers like you. We ask people to make contribution to public broadcasting for something they get for free.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Because we are available free to every home in this country. And so, both the combination of the fact that it was built as a public/private partnership, there would be some public money that went into public broadcasting that would enable stations in small communities to exist, alongside the fact that most of our support comes from people in communities. That really does create something that is very independent and very responsive to the communities that we serve.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: And if I may, just to give a sense of those numbers, for every single dollar that the federal government puts in, stations raise on average about $7 -",
      "PAULA KERGER: Right.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: From public/private - sorry, from private sources. And so you also have to recognize that this order interferes with the First Amendment rights of our listeners and viewers who have made a choice to contribute. And this is the news that they want to see and hear, or the programming that they are committed to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It did just stand out to us, as journalists ourselves, because the research shows that, you know, there's declining trust in media, in news, and the president was talking about that himself there, that he wants a free and fair press.",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Sunday that she expects Mike Waltz to have a \"brutal hearing\" for U.N. ambassador after his surprise departure last week from his post as President Trump's national security adviser.",
      "\"He's not qualified for the job, just by nature of the fact that he participated in this Signal chain,\" Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Duckworth argued that everyone in the group chat where the timing and targets of an attack on Houthis in Yemen was shared and was revealed in March to have inadvertently included a journalist, should be fired, because \"not a single one of them spoke up.\"",
      "\"Now, Mike Waltz is doing what we call \u2014 he is failing up,\" Duckworth said. \"He is failing in his job and getting promoted to be ambassador. That's not what our nation needs at the United Nations.\"",
      "Before he was tapped as national security adviser, Waltz had represented Florida in the House since 2019, and he is a Green Beret veteran who served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa. After the reports that Waltz was out as national security adviser were published, President Trump said he planned to nominate him as U.N. ambassador.",
      "Though the national security adviser post did not require Senate confirmation, the job as ambassador to the United Nations does, teeing up a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the near future.",
      "Duckworth, who sits on the committee, said she's \"not open to voting for him,\" arguing that he's \"already demonstrated he's incapable of doing the most basic thing, which is handling classified information.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's first pick for U.N. ambassador, Rep. Elise Stefanik, withdrew her name from consideration due to concerns about an open seat in Congress.",
      "President Trump announced Thursday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would take over for Waltz as national security adviser, in addition to previously giving him the duties of acting USAID administrator and acting archivist. Duckworth voted with 98 of her colleagues in the Senate to confirm Rubio as secretary of state in January. But when asked whether she's confident that he can juggle all four jobs, Duckworth said no, while pointing to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "\"Especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD, with Pete Hegseth being Secretary of Defense, and just the hollowing out of the top leadership, there's no way he can carry all that entire load on his own,\" Duckworth said of Rubio.",
      "Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who also sits on the Senate Armed Forces Committee, argued that Hegseth should be dismissed. But, she added, \"whether or not President Trump's going to dismiss him, is a whole different conversation.\"",
      "\"He should never have been nominated in the first place,\" Duckworth said, calling Hegseth \"the most untrained, inadequate, Secretary of Defense in our nation's history.\"",
      "After it was revealed in March that an Atlantic journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat where the timing and targets of an attack on Houthis in Yemen was shared, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, announced a bipartisan request for an expedited watchdog investigation into the Signal chat leak. Duckworth said senators don't have a timeline for results of the investigation, while calling the situation \"very serious.\"",
      "\"He put into an unclassified Signal chain that the aircraft are going to be over a certain point in space at a certain point in time,\" Duckworth said. \"That's classified information. Any basic person getting through military training knows that is classified information.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who\u00a0previously led the House Intelligence Committee and also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, said Waltz \"has an incredible background and experience,\" adding that he's \"certainly glad that he's going to be retained and staying in a strong role in this administration.\"",
      "On Rubio, Turner noted that Henry Kissinger also served as both secretary of state and national security adviser in the 1970s. And he said Rubio, from a policy perspective, is \"very strong in this administration,\" noting that his taking over the national security adviser post \"sends a signal of continuing the same policies in the administration\" and a \"signal of continuation and strength,\" which he called \"excellent.\"",
      "Turner said now Rubio should be given the opportunity to build out the team on the National Security Council, adding that hopefully he will be able to build a \"strong team there that represents, really, the opportunity to support President Trump.\"",

    "summary": "A federal district court judge blocked DOGE from accessing sensitive information from the Social Security Administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to let the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have access to the sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration.",
      "The emergency appeal to the Supreme Court stems from an injunction issued by a federal district court judge in Maryland who limited DOGE's access to Social Security Administration system of records containing the personal information of millions of Americans.",
      "The judge concluded in her April decision that the plaintiffs, two labor unions and an advocacy group represented by Democracy Forward, were likely to succeed on their claim that the Social Security Administration's decision to give DOGE access to millions of Americans' confidential information violated the Privacy Act and a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",
      "\"T]he issue here is not the work that DOGE or the agency want to do. The issue is about how they want to do the work,\" U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in her 145-page decision. \"The DOGE Team seeks access to the [personally identifiable information] that millions of Americans entrusted to SSA, and the SSA defendants have agreed to provide it. For some 90 years, SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records. This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation.\"",
      "She did allow DOGE team members to have access to redacted or anonymized information from the Social Security Administration, but only if they met certain conditions, such as receiving trainings and undergoing background investigations.",
      "The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined a Trump administration request to halt that injunction, leading it to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In asking the high court to lift the district court's injunction, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that it is forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "\"The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing such waste and fraud from performing their jobs,\" he said.",
      "The solicitor general, who argues on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court, said that the plaintiffs who brought the case did not have the legal right to sue. Sauer also argued that the district court did not have the legal authority to issue sweeping relief, which he said harmed \"urgent federal priorities\" and thwarted the executive branch's functions.",
      "\"Employees charged with modernizing government information systems and routing out fraud, waste, and abuse in data systems plainly need access to those systems,\" he wrote. \"Yet the district court instead viewed agency employees within the SSA DOGE team as the equivalent of intruders who break into hotel rooms.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in at least a dozen cases, as more than 200 legal challenges targeting many aspects of second-term agenda move their way through the federal courts. But the legal battle over DOGE's access to Social Security data is the first directly involving the cost-cutting task force to land before the justices.",
      "President Trump\u00a0established DOGE\u00a0on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with leading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, U.S. Digital Service, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's attempts to access Americans' sensitive data at agencies including the Departments of Treasury and Education, and the Office of Personnel Management, have led to their own set of lawsuits claiming the task force's members have not been complying with the Privacy Act, the federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information.",
      "Musk's role in DOGE, too, has sparked a set of challenges that argue his actions violate the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A different federal judge in Maryland ruled in March that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution through its unilateral shut down of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to pause that decision while it considers an appeal by the Trump administration.",

      "The president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, the official told reporters on a conference call Friday, while defense spending would surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever. The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\"This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy that you have heard and seen such action from our administration with DOGE to be able to deal with the bureaucracy that we believe has grown up over many years to be entrenched against the interests of the American people,\" the senior OMB official told reporters on a conference call Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "The president's proposed budget would put all discretionary spending at $1.7 trillion, down from $1.83 trillion in the current fiscal year, and increase defense spending by 13%, the official said. The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said.",

      "On average, agencies would see about 35% in cuts, although some entities, like the Department of Homeland Security, would see more funding under the proposal. Entities including the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services would see significant cuts under the president's proposal.",

      "\"Obviously, this president's budget, he's very, very involved throughout the process,\" the official told reporters on the conference call, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We had four years of budgets to build on and come into office, see the damage that the Biden administration has wrecked on our fiscal house, and to make updates and incorporate many of the changes that have been identified from DOGE and come to you with a proposal.\"",

    "summary": "Hundreds of cardinals attended mass inside St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican Sunday, to mark the end of a nine-day mourning period for Pope Francis.",
    "story": [
      "Sunday marked the end of a formal mourning period in the Catholic Church for Pope Francis, who died April 21 after 12 years in the papacy. He was 88. The pontiff's death catalyzed an extensive list of traditions dating back centuries, one of which is Novemdiales, a nine-day period of mourning that began with his funeral in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "The schedule for Novemdiales included daily masses inside St. Peter's Basilica, each presided over by a different cardinal and dedicated to the late pope. Sunday's mass was headed by Cardinal Dominique Mamberti, a senior deacon in the College of Cardinals that serves as advisers to the pope and steers the process of electing a replacement when the position is vacant.",
      "Like most processions held throughout the mourning phase, hundreds of cardinals attended the final event along with crowds of laypeople who packed into the cathedral. The Vatican shared a livestream of the mass on Sunday as it has done every day of Novemdiales.",
      "Mamberti led the mass in Italian, as a choir sang hymns and a number of others stepped up to the altar to sing or give remarks.",
      "\"We have all admired how Pope Francis, animated by the love of the lord and carried by his grace, was faithful to his mission until the extreme consumption of his strength,\" said Mamberti, in part of the homily translated to English by a moderator. \"He admonished the powerful, that they must obey god rather than man, and proclaimed to all humanity the joy of the gospel.\"",
      "Remembered for challenging long-held norms within the church, Francis died of a stroke on Easter Monday that led to a coma and heart failure, the Vatican said in a statement at the time. He had experienced major health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries and multiple respiratory infections. The pope was hospitalized for five weeks between February and March after developing bronchitis and, later, pneumonia.",
      "The\u00a0conclave\u00a0to select Pope Francis' successor will begin following the conclusion of Novemdiales. It officially starts May 7, when a group of about 135 cardinal electors will isolate at the Vatican and initiate an ancient ritual used to determine who becomes the next pope. Inside the Sistine Chapel, those cardinals will repeatedly cast ballots for the candidate or candidates of their choice, until a single candidate receives a two-thirds-plus-one majority.",
      "Timothy Cardinal Dolan, the archbishop of New York, discussed the upcoming conclave with reporters Sunday but did not hint at any frontrunners emerging just yet.",
      "\"In the general congregations, you don't speak about candidates. You speak about the beauty, the graces of Pope Francis and the challenges of the church,\" Dolan said, adding that some conversations between cardinals do happen privately.",
      "As far as the qualities he is looking for in the next leader of the church, Dolan said he hopes \"there's a pope that is like Jesus, because the pope is supposed to be the vicar of Christ on Earth.\"",
      "\"The first time Pope Francis spoke to us cardinals, he spoke so beautifully and humbly and simply, and I was sitting next to the Archbishop of Vienna Christoph Schonborn, and he had tears in his eyes,\" Dolan recalled. \"He said, 'He speaks like Jesus.' I said, 'I think that's the job description.'\"",

The army meanwhile began calling up thousands of reserves in anticipation of a wider operation in Gaza, officials said.",

That has plunged the territory of 2.3 million people into what is believed to be the worst humanitarian crisis since the war began.",
      "An eight-week-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that brought a lull in fighting and freed Israeli hostages collapsed in March. Israel resumed its strikes on Gaza on March 18 and has captured swaths of the coastal enclave. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the fighting resumed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 10:23:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Since the death of Pope Francis on April 21, interest has surged in the Oscar-winning film \"Conclave\" and its source novel, which dramatizes the intrigue behind the election of a new pope. \"Sunday Morning\" talks with author Robert Harris and actor Ralph Fiennes.",
    "story": [
      "In last year's Oscar-winning film \"Conclave,\" as cardinals played by John Lithgow and Ralph Fiennes confront the body of a dead pope, the process of electing his successor is set in motion.",
      "The actual conclave to elect a successor to Pope Francis will begin on Wednesday, but since his death on April 21, huge numbers of U.S. viewers have been streaming the film \u2013 around 15,000 the day before he died, 3 million since then.",
      "So, we decided to revisit the time we spent with Fiennes in Rome and then in New York City when the film came out last fall.",
      "At Villa Medici, one of the filming locations for \"Conclave,\" Fiennes said, \"To the person who knows, this is not the Vatican. But I think for a film, you could believe this was an aspect of the Vatican, and actually we shot just inside here.\"",
      "Fiennes played Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, who betrays his own suppressed ambition to be pope to another cardinal, played by Stanley Tucci. Both men are caught up in the claustrophobic pressure cooker of papal politics. The cardinals are locked in, imprisoned in magnificence and secrecy.",
      "Most of the film was shot at Rome's famous Cinecitta Studios. Of the costumes, Fiennes said, \"Clothes are hugely important, and if you put on a robe like that and it hangs on you in a certain way, suddenly it does something to you for sure. You move differently, and you're in that Sistine Chapel set that we created at Cinecitta, immediately. I mean, it was amazing shooting those voting scenes. It felt like we were in the real place. The sense of silence and ritual was palpable.\"",
      "Sequestered, the College of Cardinals casts ballots for a papal successor. \"It's a context of wealth,\" said Fiennes, \"of worldly wealth, and these holy men \u2026\"",
      "\"Supposedly holy,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, I was gonna do inverted comma signs! They are in a structure which massages their political instinct about the thing they're in called the church.\"",
      "Robert Harris wrote the 2016 novel that inspired the film. \"Well, I was a political journalist, and it is politics which fascinates me,\" he said. \"And conclave is just, for me, the ultimate election. It's the oldest election, the most extraordinary.\"",
      "Since Pope Francis' death, sales of Harris' novel are up tenfold.",
      "\"It's not that I'm a kind of, you know, seer in some way,\" Harris said. \"It's just that the conclave always falls into roughly this pattern. There are traditionalists and there are reformers. There are geographical blocs. And out of this mix, a compromise candidate emerges.\"",
      "In the book and the film, the traditionalist is Tedesco; the reformer, Bellini; Tremblay is a moderate, but a schemer; there's Adeyemi, the African contender. One by one, they're eliminated, and a compromise candidate does emerge.",
      "Harris said, \"The thing takes on a momentum of its own, as any group would. You know, like a jury that suddenly swings to a verdict, this is called within the spiritual world a movement of the holy ghost through the Sistine. In the political world, it would be called momentum.\"",
      "Although Harris is not a Catholic, his take on what happens during a conclave is generally regarded as pretty accurate.",
      "I asked, \"It seems as if the idea of the book is that somehow these flawed men, who are also holy men, do arrive at the right choice?\"",
      "\"Yes, I think it's a very good process,\" Harris replied. \"I think the Roman Catholic Church has immense wisdom of centuries built into it.\"",
      "Fiennes said, \"The film leaves you with a question: Who should lead? Who should lead a structure like the Catholic Church? Who is the person worthy of it?\"",
      "\"But it also asks the question, will the political process that determines the leader produce the right leader?\" I asked. \"The film seems to say yes.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the film does, in this case, say, it can,\" Fiennes said.",
      "Fiennes, like the cardinal he plays, is a man of doubts. He said, \"I was brought up a Catholic, and then I rebelled when I was 13. My mother was a committed Catholic. On my mother's side, there are some theologians. So, God questions have been in my family since I was a child.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you come away with anything answered of your own questions?\"",
      "\"No,\" Fiennes replied. \"I came away with more questions.\"",
      "As dramatized in the film by Cardinal Thomas Lawrence's sermon: \"If there was only certainty and no doubt, there would be no mystery, and therefore no need for faith.\"",
      "Harris said, \"The way that he pronounces the word faith at the end is just extraordinary.\"",
      "Harris is a big fan of the movie. Now, he is watching his book come to life for real. \"I've seen the early stages of the novel sort of unfold in front of me,\" he said. \"And that has been a rather strange sensation, frankly \u2013 to witness this machinery going into operation.\"",
      "No matter who ends up pope, Harris, the ex-newsman-turned-novelist, knows a good story when he sees one: \"The whole imagery of it. The smoke coming out of the chimney. I mean, what an extraordinary, brilliant concept that is, that's entered the language and the culture of the world. It's a spectacle that plays very, very well.",
      "\"I'm amused, incidentally, that the conclave is going to start, I think it's on a Wednesday,\" he added. \"There will be a real strong feeling among the cardinals that they'd quite like to get out of Rome the Friday afternoon. It's quite an effective, shrewd deadline!\"",

The rate is widely expected to be cut again at the bank's next board meeting on May 20, this time to encourage investment amid the international economic uncertainty generated by Trump's tariff policies.",

      "Speculation about a papal candidate's health is a mainstay of conclave politics and maneuvering, as various factions try to torpedo or boost certain candidates. Francis experienced the dynamic firsthand: When the votes were going his way in the 2013 conclave, one breathless cardinal asked him if it was true that he had only one lung, as rumors had it. (Francis later recounted that he told the cardinal he had had the upper lobe of one lung removed as a young man.) He was elected a short time later.",

Of all the current cardinal electors, 108 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States.",
      "What happens in the conclave?",
      "Under church rules, the conclave must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death. Pope Francis\u00a0died on April 21.",
      "Wednesday morning begins with a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, after which the cardinal electors are sequestered from the rest of the world. In the afternoon, they will process into the Sistine Chapel, hear a meditation and take their oaths before casting their first ballots.",
      "If no candidate reaches the necessary two-thirds majority on the first ballot, the papers will be burned and black smoke will indicate to the world that no pope was elected.",
      "The cardinals will go back to their Vatican residence for the night and return to the Sistine Chapel on Thursday morning to conduct two votes in the morning, two in the afternoon, until a winner is found.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave, they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "After every two rounds of voting, the ballots are burned in the stove.

A U.S. official and a Rwandan official both confirmed the active talks about sending third-country deportees from U.S. soil to the east African nation.",

The Rwandan official also told CBS News that Kigali had unique past experience with handling deportees, and cited a past deal with the United Kingdom. The U.K.'s deportation of asylum seekers in 2024 sparked legal and political controversy for the then conservative U.K. government. Immediately after taking office last year, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the policy was \"dead and buried.\"",
      "The Trump administration has looked to third countries to handle America's influx of migrants and attempts to deport them. El Salvador has an arrangement with the Trump administration to accept deportees and to imprison some of them for a fee, including at the notorious CECOT prison, a move which has led to a flurry of legal action. Other countries, including Mexico and Panama, have agreed to accept deportees who are not their own nationals.",
      "The deportation talks with the State Department come at the same time that the U.S. is trying to broker a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "In front of the cameras, Rubio also praised Mr. Trump's envoy to Africa, Massad Boulos, who is Tiffany Trump's father-in-law, and said he'd recently sent him to the region. Boulos, who has the title of senior advisor for Africa, has publicly spoken of his efforts to broker billion-dollar minerals deals in the region.",

      "While many public policy leaders believe implementation of REAL ID requirements across the country will bolster national security, some more libertarian critics say the Bush-era protocol could come at a cost to individual liberty and bigger government, with one expert telling Fox News Digital it essentially sets up a de facto national ID system and treats law-abiding Americans with suspicion.",
      "When Congress debated REAL ID in 2005, libertarian Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, strongly opposed the move, positing that it constituted a national ID card that had no limitations on what type of information could be stored on it, posing a significant threat to American civil liberties.",
      "After being signed into law, the implementation of REAL ID was repeatedly postponed during administrations of both political parties, including the first Trump administration during the height of the COVID pandemic. This year, however, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) set a new deadline for obtaining a REAL ID of May 7. Having REAL ID-compliant identification will be required to board domestic commercial airline flights and to access some federal facilities like courthouses or military bases.",

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images | Fox News Digital)",
      "Simon Hankinson, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Border Security and Immigration Center, told Fox News Digital that requiring additional documentation to obtain a REAL ID will have a significant impact on identifying and cracking down on terrorism and other illegal activity in the U.S., including illegal immigration.",
      "By requiring a REAL ID to fly, Hankinson explained that IDs offered by liberal states to illegal immigrants will no longer allow those illegals to easily move about the country unchecked.",
      "He pointed to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, in which several of the al Qaeda terrorists involved had obtained valid state licenses, which were accepted for boarding their flights.",

      "But Jim Harper, a senior fellow of digital privacy and constitutional law at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital that though REAL ID is not technically a national identification card, since it is issued by individual states, obtaining one enters private citizens into a national database, effectively making it a national identification system.",
      "\"REAL\u00a0ID is a national ID system. And historically, national ID systems have been used for terrible things,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that we don't position ourselves in the United States ever to have that much authority reside with the government.

      "He granted that the dangers of REAL ID are \"not as urgent\" as something like the Patriot Act, which was passed in the wake of 9/11 and significantly expanded the scope and powers of law enforcement and intelligence operations in the U.S., but that it similarly expands the ability of the government to control and monitor its citizenry.",
      "\"I reject the idea of having law-abiding American citizens put into a national I.D. system because they might be terrorists. That's not the way we do law enforcement in this country, to treat people as suspects from go,\" he said. \"I don't think natural born citizens should, should be put into a national I.D. system for immigration control. That's the that's the problem of illegal immigration being visited on the citizen. That's not how it's supposed to work.\"",
      "In his view, the \"burden\" of the reasons for having a national ID \"all falls on the citizen, on the individual who's not accused of any crime or any wrongdoing. That's not the way to do it.\"",

When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation.

      "Healthcare seems to be the favorite target of attackers this year. It's been only four months, and we've already seen some of the biggest data breaches in the sector. Recently, news about the Blue Shield of California data breach came to light, leaking the personal data of 4.7 million people.",

      "What you need to know",
      "According to a\u00a0legally mandated disclosure with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Yale New Haven Health experienced a cyberattack on March 8 that allowed malicious hackers to obtain copies of patients' personally identifiable information as well as some healthcare-related data.",
      "Yale New Haven Health is a nonprofit healthcare system based in New Haven, Connecticut. It includes five acute-care hospitals, a medical foundation, and a network of outpatient facilities and multispecialty centers across Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In a\u00a0notice posted on its website, the healthcare system said the stolen data varied by individual but could include names, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, race and ethnicity information, Social Security numbers, types of patients and medical record numbers. Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved.",
      "This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions like\u00a0UnitedHealth and\u00a0Ascension Health have led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations.",
      "Illustration of a doctor looking at data on a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVER",
      "What Yale New Haven Health is doing",
      "Yale New Haven Health brought in cybersecurity firm Mandiant to assist with the investigation and said a rapid response helped contain the incident and prevent any disruption to patient care. The organization noted that it regularly updates and strengthens its systems to protect sensitive data and will continue those efforts. Notification letters began going out to affected individuals on April 14, and complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services have been offered to those whose Social Security numbers were compromised.",
      "The breach could have serious consequences for those impacted. The stolen data includes highly sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, phishing attacks or targeted scams. Healthcare data is especially valuable on the black market because it can be exploited for long periods without easy detection. Even if Social Security numbers or medical information aren\u2019t misused right away, the long-term risk for affected individuals remains significant.",
      "We reached out to Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS), and a health system spokesperson said in part:",
      "\"We take our responsibility to safeguard patient information incredibly seriously, and we regret any concern this incident may have caused. We are continuously updating and enhancing our systems to protect the data we maintain and to help prevent events such as this from occurring in the future. For more information on this incident, patients may visit YNHHS\u2019 website at\u00a0ynhhs.org or call our dedicated, toll-free call center at 1-855-549-2678, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 am and 9:00 pm Eastern Time, excluding major U.S. holidays.\"",

      "If your information was part of the Yale New Haven Health breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker\u2019s requirements.",
      "In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy.",
      "The bottom line: Why personal data removal services win the privacy battle",
      "After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If you\u2019ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",

      "For the first time ever, surgeons at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) successfully performed a heart transplant in which the donor organ never stopped beating. This revolutionary procedure eliminates the traditional pause in blood flow, known as ischemic time, dramatically reducing damage to the heart muscle and improving the chances of a successful transplant.",

Even a few hours without oxygen can damage heart muscle, raising the risks of rejection or complications post-surgery. NTUH\u2019s method?

During the first surgery, the team transported a donor heart between operating rooms while it was still beating, hooked up to this device.

      "\"This denial,\" Orenstein told Fox News Digital, \"aimed to delegitimize and undermine the Jewish people's legal, moral and historical right to sovereignty in the Land of Israel, portraying a people with some of the deepest archaeological ties to the land as occupiers and colonizers.",
      "\"For that reason, the Islamic Waqf carried out a campaign of systematic destruction of antiquities atop the Temple Mount in the late 1990s, and Palestinian leadership continues to deny, damage, and destroy Jewish heritage sites throughout Judea and Samaria,\" he said.",

Pope John Paul II made history by becoming the first pope from Poland and his pontificate lasted 26 years (1978-2006). Francis was head of the Catholic Church for a much shorter time, almost exactly 12 years, but the late pope appointed 80% of the cardinals who will vote for his successor.",
      "The late Holy Father also enlarged the number of cardinals and, for the first time in history, the upcoming conclave will see European cardinals in the minority.

Tagle has publicly criticized the church for using \"harsh words\" in past criticisms of LGBTQ Catholics and remarried divorcees and advocates for a more flexible approach. This stance is in line with Pope Francis\u2019 2015 papal declaration that said the church needs to \"avoid judgments which do not take into account the complexity of various situations.\"",

      "The effort is \"eight and a half years late,\" Hugh Dugan,\u00a0former National Security Council Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Organization Affairs, told Fox News Digital: \"If [Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio] Guterres really comprehends that the system needs a major overhaul, he should step down and facilitate an early U.N.

      "As another means of reducing outlays, the task force also recommended reducing the quantity of high-level posts, establishing single entities to coordinate Peace and Security, Humanitarian Affairs, and Human Rights, and \"reduc[ing] the number of U.N. development system entities.\"",

      "Dujarric pointed to a speech Guterres delivered in March when introducing the UN80 Initiative, in which he called for an \"ambitious reform agenda to strengthen how we work and deliver.\" Guterres said this involves increasing transparency and accountability, being more effective and cutting costs, and decentralizing decisions to serve those who rely on the U.N.",

      "Trump also highlighted several other rising stars in the Republican Party he said are capable of carrying the MAGA mantle after he\u2019s finished as the GOP\u2019s elected leader, mentioning not only Vice President JD Vance but also Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has become a central player in his second administration.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be an eight-year president; I\u2019ll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important,\u201d Trump told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in an interview that aired Sunday.",
      "Trump told Welker in March that he was \u201cnot joking\u201d about his consideration of a third run, and he said again in his latest interview that he\u2019s received strong requests from allies to run again. Despite those entreaties, Trump told Welker, he\u2019s aware of the realities standing in the way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you\u2019re not allowed to do. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s constitutional that they\u2019re not allowing you to do it or anything else,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Trump downplays recession fears, saying the U.S. would be 'OK' in the long term",
      "The Constitution\u2019s 22nd Amendment says, \u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\u201d Amending the Constitution to abolish that limit would be extremely difficult, requiring the support of either two-thirds of both the House and Senate or two-thirds of state legislatures. Both routes would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states.",
      "Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., introduced a House joint resolution in January seeking to amend the Constitution to allow the president to be elected for up to three terms, a legislative effort that so far has seen little movement. Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York, who served as lead counsel during Trump\u2019s first impeachment, introduced a resolution in response urging his colleagues to reaffirm the 22nd Amendment\u2019s prohibition on a third term.",
      "Trump told Welker he has had no official meetings specifically about establishing a pathway for a third term, but he\u2019s heard \u201cdifferent concepts\u201d about potential options \u2014 including a legally dubious strategy in which Vance would seek the presidency and then pass the role on to Trump.",
      "\"Other people say, 'You can have a write-in vote,'\" Trump added, despite the constitutional limitation.",
      "Talk of a potential third Trump term reached a fever pitch last month after the Trump Organization, led in part by the president\u2019s two adult sons, began selling Trump 2028-branded red hats. The hats were listed for $50 with the description: \u201cThe future looks bright! Rewrite the rules with the Trump 2028 high crown hat.\u201d",
      "Despite that description \u2014 and its pointed reference to \u201crewrite the rules\u201d \u2014 Trump said his aim is to ultimately pass the torch ahead of the next presidential election.",
      "\u201cThere are many people selling the 2028 hat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut this is not something I\u2019m looking to do. I\u2019m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.\u201d",
      "Among the GOP stars Trump said can take charge of the MAGA brand \u2014 which he described as the greatest political movement in history \u2014 is Vance, who Trump suggested would likely have an advantage over other competitors in a Republican primary for the top job. Welker asked if Vance would be \u201cat the top of the list\u201d as his successor, and Trump praised his vice president without making any commitments.",
      "\u201cIt could very well be,\u201d Trump said, before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved in that. I think he\u2019s a fantastic, brilliant guy. Marco is great. There\u2019s a lot of them that are great.\u201d",
      "He also emphasized that such discussions are \u201cfar too early.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut certainly you would say that somebody\u2019s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has declined to be drawn into endorsing or labeling Vance as his anointed successor, while still showering him with praise over his work. In February, Trump told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier that Vance is \u201cvery capable\u201d but that he did not necessarily view Vance as his successor.",
      "Trump also named Rubio as a \u201cgreat\u201d potential GOP leader. Trump\u2019s confidence in the former Florida senator is reflected in Rubio\u2019s wide portfolio in the administration: He\u2019s been tapped by the president to serve as the acting head of the National Archives, acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and, most recently, national security adviser \u2014 replacing Michael Waltz, whom Trump instead said he would nominate to be ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cMarco\u2019s doing an outstanding job,\u201d Trump said when the interview turned to Waltz. He added that while he does not expect Rubio to remain in his newest role in the \u201clong term,\u201d he\u2019s in no rush to replace him.",
      "\u201cNow, Marco won\u2019t keep \u2014 Marco\u2019s very busy doing other things, so he\u2019s not going to keep it long term. We\u2019re going to put somebody else in,\u201d Trump said, though he later noted that Henry Kissinger served as both secretary of state and national security adviser, adding: \u201cHenry Kissinger did both. There\u2019s a theory that you don\u2019t need two people. But I think I have some really great people that could do a good job.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if Rubio could continue in both jobs \u201cindefinitely,\u201d Trump said: \u201cHe could, yeah. He could. But I think he even would like to probably see \u2014 because it is a little bit different. But in the meantime, he\u2019ll handle it.\u201d",
      "The field of \u201ctremendous\u201d Republicans Trump said could emerge as 2028 front-runners, a group that he said includes as many as 20 people, does not appear to be a chief concern for the president months into his second term. He suggested to Welker that he\u2019s much more focused on a more immediate election, the 2026 midterms, in which Republicans will have to fight historical odds to maintain control of both chambers of Congress.",
      "Backlash against Trump\u2019s swift use of executive authority to reshape the federal government \u2014 from targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to imposing new tariffs on dozens of countries \u2014 have weighed on the GOP politically, with Trump\u2019s approval ratings steadily declining through his first 100 days.",
      "The economic consequences of the tariffs in particular appear to be politically damaging, with Trump\u2019s handling of tariffs earning him especially low marks compared to other issues in recent public surveys, including CNBC and NBC News Stay Tuned polls.",
      "Trump told Welker he plans to play a \u201cvery active\u201d role in the midterm cycle, especially through his fundraising prowess. He downplayed concerns that his agenda may cost Republicans one or both chambers of Congress.",
      "\u201cIf you look, it\u2019s pretty consistent that whoever wins the presidency ends up losing the House, losing the Senate. I think we\u2019re going to turn that around. I think we\u2019re going to turn it around easy,\u201d Trump said."

Trump has also said that while \u201cwe always have to obey the laws,\u201d he would like to see some \u201chomegrown criminals\u201d sent to El Salvador as well, a proposal that was widely panned by legal experts.",
      "When Welker tried to point out what the Fifth Amendment said, Trump suggested that such a process would slow him down too much.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know. It seems \u2014 it might say that, but if you\u2019re talking about that, then we\u2019d have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have thousands of people that are \u2014 some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst people on Earth.\u201d",

      "The Supreme Court has already made it clear to the Trump administration in three different recent decisions that it has to allow basic due process rights for immigrants based on the long-standing understanding of the laws.",
      "That would not require full trials, as Trump suggested. What it would require is the chance to appear before an immigration judge. Such judges are not part of the judicial branch; they are employees of the Justice Department. Administration officials have spoken out against such constraints, leading to allegations that they have defied instructions from lower court judges and even the Supreme Court.",
      "One major point of contention has been the administration\u2019s novel invocation of a 1798 law, the Alien Enemies Act, to quickly deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The law has previously been used only during times of war, but the U.S. government is claiming that the gang is effectively an invading force connected to the Venezuelan government in order to use the law\u2019s power to remove people without going through the processes laid out in other laws, like the Immigration and Nationality Act. That effort, though, is facing stiff opposition.",
      "Men facing deportation under the law said they had no chance to contest whether they are even members of the gang, leading to two different Supreme Court decisions that blocked the administration from sending them to prison in El Salvador without due process. One decision came early on the morning of April 19, hours after men had been loaded onto buses and were seen heading toward an airport in Texas.",
      "Another high-profile case has involved Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was living in Maryland with his wife and three children when he was deported to El Salvador. The Trump administration accused him of being a member of the MS-13 gang \u2014 which Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife and attorney deny \u2014 in its justification for deporting him to his home country, even though an immigration judge\u2019s order from 2019 barred him from being sent there.",
      "The administration has admitted that it was an \u201cadministrative error\u201d to deport him, and the Supreme Court ordered that the government \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return to the United States so that he can plead his case. The administration appears to have made little effort to do so and has insisted it doesn\u2019t have the power to force El Salvador to do so.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump replied when asked whether anyone in his administration is in touch with the government of El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask the attorney general that question.\u201d",
      "It is not disputed that Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally or that the government could potentially deport him.",
      "Trump insisted he was not defying the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cNo. I\u2019m relying on the attorney general of the United States, Pam Bondi, who\u2019s very capable, doing a great job. Because I\u2019m not involved in the legality or the illegality,\u201d he said. \u201cI have lawyers to do that and that\u2019s why I have a great DOJ.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe may do that. I was asking about that. We may do that,\u201d he said.",
      "The administration lost in lower courts over its response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Abrego Garcia case but has yet to ask the justices to intervene for a second time.",
      "The Trump administration has other options to speed up the deportation process \u2014 for example, by asking Congress to amend immigration laws and expand resources for immigration judges so that a backlog of cases can be processed more quickly. The administration, however, has fired some immigration judges.",
      "Welker also noted that some Americans have been mistakenly detained by immigration authorities under Trump\u2019s administration and asked whether lawful residents need to start carrying paperwork when they leave home, in order to prove their status.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be necessary,\u201d Trump said. He then shifted, speaking about people who \u201chave been killed, maimed, badly hurt by illegal immigrants that came over that are from prisons and from jails and from mental institutions.\u201d",
      "During his interview Friday, Trump repeatedly invoked his lawyers, saying he was heeding their instructions to make sure he was following the law. In addition to immigration, Trump addressed his threat to take away the tax-exempt status of Harvard University.",
      "The Ivy League school recently sued the federal government over its decision to freeze more than $2 billion in funding.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview that he\u2019d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary.",
      "The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that the Amazon was going to begin to list tariff charges on certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to impose 145% tariffs on China.",
      "\"He\u2019s just a very nice guy,\" Trump said of Bezos in an interview that aired Sunday. \"We have a relationship. I asked him about [the tariff charge language Amazon considered including in listings]. He said, 'Well, I don\u2019t want to do that,' and he took it off immediately.\"",
      "Trump and Bezos appear to have developed a closer relationship in the last few months than they had during Trump\u2019s first administration.",
      "In December, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, and Bezos attended his swearing-in ceremony. Bezos stepped down as the company's CEO in 2021, but he is still its executive chairman.",
      "Indeed, in a statement shortly after the Punchbowl report, an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News, \"The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: \"Sure. I\u2019ll always call people if I disagree with them.\"",
      "\"If I think that somebody\u2019s doing something that\u2019s incorrect, wrong or maybe hurtful to the country, I\u2019ll call,\" he added. \"Wouldn\u2019t you want me to call? [Former President Joe] Biden wouldn\u2019t call because he didn\u2019t know what was happening, but I do.\"",
      "In the interview, Trump defended his decision to impose major tariffs on imports from China, saying the move is supposed to give companies incentives to build factories in the United States to avoid paying tariffs, not simply raise prices on consumers to offset the cost of tariffs.",
      "\"I don\u2019t view it as a tax. I view it as an incentive for people to come into the United States and build plants, factories, offices, a lot of things. I think it\u2019s an incentive,\" he told Welker.",
      "\"What people don\u2019t understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. The company eats the tariff. And it\u2019s not passed along at all,\" he added.",
      "Several other major online retailers, like Temu, a low-cost retail site based in China, have already begun charging consumers tariff fees, adding a line item on purchases that's listed as \u201cimport charges.\u201d",
      "Other popular American retailers, like B\u00e9is, Bare Necessities and Fashion Nova, have urged consumers to shop more in the near term, predicting that imposing future tariffs could force them to raise prices.",
      "Larger companies, like PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, have issued similar warnings, telling shareholders in recent meetings that they're already seeing the impacts of tariffs on earnings.",
      "Trump has acknowledged that tariffs could have an impact on the availability of consumer goods in the near term.",
      "Asked whether his remark about children having fewer toys during a Cabinet meeting was an acknowledgment that tariffs would cause prices to rise, Trump told Welker: \"I don\u2019t think that a beautiful baby girl needs \u2014 that\u2019s 11 years old \u2014 needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls, because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable.\"",
      "Trump made a similar remark at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, telling members of his administration: \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\u201d",
      "But he pushed back against the assertion that he was predicting price hikes or supply shortages due to tariffs.",
      "\"I\u2019m just saying they don\u2019t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don\u2019t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,\" he said, adding, \"we don\u2019t have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don\u2019t need, for junk that we don\u2019t need.\""

    "story": [
      "In the week following President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement, it looked like the stock market had seen a ghost.",
      "Over the course of seven days following his April 2 announcement, the S&P 500 lost more than 12%, a decline not typically seen outside of extreme events like the Covid-19 pandemic and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. That stretch last month also saw the fifth-worst two-day percentage decline since World War II.",
      "Government bond yields, too, began to creep steadily upward, making it more expensive for the U.S. to borrow money, amid signs that both the substance and erratic rollout of Trump\u2019s tariff plan were testing traders\u2019 faith in the United States\u2019 ability to make timely payments on its debt.",
      "Stocks around the world sold off, too.",
      "\u201cApril was an absolutely seismic month in financial markets, as the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs led to a huge global sell-off,\u201d analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cThe initial moves were truly historic in their speed.\u201d",
      "With the stock and bond markets blaring red alerts, Trump backed off some of his tariffs on April 9, triggering euphoria among investors. After he announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs for \u201cnon-retaliating\u201d countries, the S&P saw its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, with a 9.5% gain. At the same time, the sell-off in Treasurys stabilized.",
      "Now, 32 days after the historic Rose Garden speech, stocks have executed a stunning comeback of sorts, with the broader market largely returning to where it was when the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs were first announced. Volatility in government borrowing costs, too, has leveled off.",
      "The gains are relative: Stocks remain about 6% below their pre-Inauguration Day levels. But some blue chip companies like Apple are still hobbling. The iPhone maker\u2019s stock is down more than 20% since its all-time high last winter, though partly for reasons beyond the president\u2019s policies.\u00a0Tesla, which is helmed by Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump,\u00a0is still 40% off its December peak.",
      "Nevertheless, the broader recovery has been significant. According to Dow Jones, the eight trading days through Thursday last week saw the biggest gain for the S&P 500 since November 2020, when markets showed their first signs of recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "And with Friday\u2019s close, the index saw its longest winning streak in 20 years.",
      "Experts say the\u00a0recovery has been fueled by a combination of Trump\u2019s softening tone on tariffs and investors entering an \u201cacceptance\u201d stage that whatever the president ends up saying, tariffs are here to stay in some form or another.",
      "\u201cMarkets are adjusting to the tariffs story and saying, \u2018OK, this has happened, now what do we do about it?\u2019\u201d said Roxanna Islam, head of research at VettaFi, an asset management platform. \u201cPeople are starting to look more forward than backward.\u201d",
      "If flows of money into a popular low-cost investment vehicle are any indication, the recovery has been led by so-called \u201cretail\u201d investors, opportunistic buyers who are more apt to make daily market trades. That group stands in contrast to longer-term investors like 401(k) holders or large institutions, which typically take a more measured, long-term view of investing.",
      "According to the Vanguard investment group, which runs investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), \u201cbulls,\u201d or net buyers of stocks, outnumbered \u201cbears\u201d (net sellers) by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1 among self-directed investors. The Vanguard ETF saw a $21 billion inflow last month, the most in its 15-year history and the fifth-largest amount ever taken in by a fund on a monthly basis, Bloomberg News reported.",
      "\u201cIt would be simplistic to say it\u2019s just retail \u2014 but to a large extent it has been,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at the Interactive Brokers financial group.",
      "The retail investment boom surfaced during the pandemic, when day traders turned to playing markets amid nationwide shutdowns. The trend became best known for fueling mania in \u201cmeme\u201d stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond that would see intense run-ups in price amid online speculation about company turnarounds.",
      "The meme-stock days have largely faded, but the impulse to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d \u2014 the popular phrase used to describe when investors bet on stock prices rising after they\u2019ve gone down \u2014 remains, Sosnick said.",
      "\u201cI think the key element has been American investors\u2019 unrelenting faith that every dip is a buying opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if enough have this faith, it can make itself true.\u201d",
      "The recovery remains extremely fragile. Stocks are highly sensitive to any hints of trade deals, especially with China, which was excluded from Trump\u2019s initial tariff pause. As recently as Friday, stocks surged on a Wall Street Journal report that China was open to addressing Trump\u2019s concerns about its role in the fentanyl crisis as an entry point for both sides softening their trade dispute.",
      "And the overall economic picture remains uncertain. Despite a strong jobs report Friday, other indicators suggest the economy is throttling back. Economic growth was negative for the first three months of the year, and while much of that was a function of a surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to a 1.8% quarterly gain after surging to a 4% gain in the fourth quarter last year.",
      "Friday\u2019s jobs report also showed the median duration of unemployment is surging and average hourly earnings growth is slowing.",
      "Companies, too, are lowering their financial guidance for the year, or withdrawing it as they await clarity on how Trump\u2019s tariffs shake out.",
      "As a result, overall investment sentiment remains bearish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), whose regular survey most recently showed that expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 3.7 percentage points to 59.3%.",
      "\u201cBearish sentiment is unusually high and is above its historical average of 31.0% for the 22nd time in 24 weeks,\u201d the AAII said. \u201cBearish sentiment has now been above 50% for 10-consecutive weeks, the longest period over 50% in the survey\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Even for people without direct exposure to the stock market, the negative sentiment can have an impact on the broader economy, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.",
      "\u201cThose negative headlines do take a toll beyond those who have a particular stake in the market,\u201d he said.",
      "There are also signs that the \u201cSell America\u201d trade is lingering, according to Bob Elliott, CEO of the Unlimited Funds investment group, who noted in a post on X Friday that the value of the U.S. dollar remains well below where it was just before Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcement, while gold and foreign stocks have been outperforming U.S. equities.",
      "There\u2019s been a \u201crotation away from the U.S.\u201d even with better-than-expected data, Elliott said.",
      "In short, it remains to be seen where the market goes from here.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d said Islam, of VettaFi. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of that uncertainty.\u201d"

He qualified fourth, two positions behind Norris, but got ahead of his teammate as Norris tangled with Red Bull pole-sitter Max Verstappen in the first few corners and lost positions. Norris fell to sixth place accused Verstappen of pushing him off the track.",

      "Bombarded on a near daily basis and with food and medicine increasingly scarce, Gaza has effectively shrunk for its Palestinian population since Israel resumed its military campaign in March and has taken control of more territory.",
      "An NBC News analysis of maps, evacuation orders and statements released by the Israel Defense Forces, as well as interviews with experts, humanitarian workers and civilians, shows that people have been pushed into increasingly crowded areas, and that a humanitarian zone once deemed safe is no longer designated as such.",
      "Israel broke its fragile truce with Hamas on March 18, just over two weeks after the first phase of the three-part ceasefire deal came to an end. Negotiations on the second phase of the deal, meant to establish a permanent end to the fighting, have since stalled, with Israel also blocking the flow of aid and goods into Gaza for more than 60 days.",
      "Along with regular airstrikes and ground operations, its military has also moved to secure more of the enclave, while nearly half a million Palestinians in Gaza have been newly displaced, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, recently warned."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Sunday he will direct several federal agencies to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz,\" a facility that for decades was a federal prison and is now a national park.",
      "\"REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ! For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "\"I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America\u2019s most ruthless and violent Offenders,\" he added.",
      "Alcatraz Island, a former military fortress and prison in San Francisco Bay, was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and over the course of 29 years housed more than 1,500 people \"deemed difficult to incarcerate elsewhere in the federal prison system,\" according to the National Park Service.",
      "According to a National Park Service study, it was initially deemed unfit to serve as a federal institution because of its small size, isolated location and lack of fresh water. However, Sanford Bates, the director of the Bureau of Prisons in 1933, later found it \"an ideal place of confinement for about 200 of the most desperate or irredeemable types.\" It was formally opened as a federal penitentiary the next year.",
      "Trump suggested in his post that he'd like to restore the facility to that purpose.",
      "\"When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be,\" he wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night.",
      "According to the Bureau of Prisons, the average population of Alcatraz during its use was 260 to 275. The facility never reached its capacity of 336 people, and it held less than 1% of the total federal prison population.",
      "Trump seemed to suggest the island could be used to house some undocumented immigrants he has been seeking to remove from the country, making a pointed reference in his post to \"judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals who came into our country illegally.\"",
      "Trump in March sent more than 200 deportees he accused of being Venezuelan gang members to a terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, arguing his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act enabled him to do so, even though a federal judge blocked the effort.",
      "A Trump-appointed federal judge last week rejected Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members.",
      "Trump decried the judicial rulings in explaining his rationale for reopening the prison Sunday evening, describing Alcatraz as a famous \"symbol of law and order.\"",
      "\"The judges, so many of these radicalized judges, they want to have trials for every single, think of it, every single person that\u2019s in our country illegally,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday evening. \"That would mean millions of trials, and it\u2019s just so ridiculous what\u2019s happening.\"",
      "Trump similarly announced an effort in March to detain immigrants he's seeking to deport in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, but concerns about the legality and the cost of the move have led the administration to reconsider the plan.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons operates at least 120 federal institutions and manages a population of 156,254 people.",
      "It is unclear how feasible the move is considering ongoing budget constraints at the Bureau of Prisons, which told a union representing some of its staff members in December that it planned to close several facilities.",
      "Alcatraz closed as a penitentiary in 1963, according to the Bureau of Prisons, because of expensive operating costs further heightened by the physical isolation of the island, which meant all food and supplies had to be delivered by boat.",
      "\"An estimated $3-5 million was needed just for restoration and maintenance work to keep the prison open. That figure did not include daily operating costs \u2014 Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison,\" the Bureau of Prisons wrote of the penitentiary's closing.",
      "Nearly a decade later, in 1972, Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, which included Alcatraz Island. The complex opened to the public a year later, and it has gone on to become among the most popular National Park Service sites, according to the agency, hosting more than 1 million visitors annually.",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, whose district includes the island, said Trump's proposal \"is not a serious one,\" noting on X that it is now \"a major tourist attraction.\"",
      "A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom also downplayed the legitimacy of the idea.",
      "\u201cLooks like it\u2019s distraction day again in Washington, D.C.,\" said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, Newsom's deputy director of communication."

      "He said that he hopes they learn something and that in the future they think twice before they throw words around.",
      "\"To me, that's a fair outcome of this event,\" Portnoy said. \"We're going to send them ... to Auschwitz and learn a little bit about history and hopefully, you know, get educated and use this as a teaching moment, not just for them, but maybe for everybody.\""

      "The 2025 Met Gala will stray from the norm of the past 20 years as the fashion event is set to focus exclusively on menswear in honor of its theme: \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style.\u201d",
      "Celebrities who score an invite to the star-studded gala haven\u2019t been encouraged to sport menswear since 2003, when the theme was \u201cMen in Skirts,\u201d according to Vogue. This year, the theme and the dress code \u2014 \u201cTailored For You\u201d \u2014 were inspired by Barnard professor and author Monica L. Miller\u2019s 2009 book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\u201d Her novel examines the importance and influence of a fashion icon: the Black dandy.",

The exhibit, like the upcoming Met Gala on Monday, May 5, will pay homage to Black dandyism, an elevated style of dress and elegance redefined by Black aesthetes after dandyism was imposed upon them, and how it has evolved for over 300 years.",

      "Co-chairs Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams, as well as honorary chair LeBron James, are expected to have all eyes on them when they arrive at the gala and pose on The Met\u2019s grand steps. Celebrities like Andr\u00e9 3000, Simone Biles, Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Spike Lee, Usher and more have been named members of the Met Gala host committee and are also expected to attend.",
      "Read on to learn more about the theme, Black dandyism and some looks A-listers might sport on the red carpet, below.",
      "What is \u2018Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\u2019?",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is described on The Met\u2019s website as examining the \u201cimportance of style to the formation of Black identities in the Atlantic diaspora, particularly in the United States and Europe.\u201d",
      "The museum explains how Black style has evolved for over 300 years and is rooted in the idea of Black dandyism, which was birthed by \u201cthe intersection of African and European style traditions.\u201d During the style's origins in the 18th century, there was more access to clothing and goods as a result of the transatlantic slave trade, which began in 16th century, in addition to colonialism and imperialism.",
      "The Met Gala 2025 theme of \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d will also be showcased in the museum\u2019s corresponding exhibit.",
      "The Met previously announced that the theme will be represented in the exhibition through 12 different sections that encompass the Black dandy: Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook, Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism.",
      "The museum also revealed that the exhibit will feature photos of civil rights activist W.E.B. DuBois, writings by authors Zora Neale Hurston and Nikki Giovanni \u2014 who died in December 2024 \u2014 and archival pieces from leaders in Black media, like Jet magazine. Clothing worn by pioneers in Black history like Frederick Douglass and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, will be on display, too.",
      "What is Black dandyism?",
      "Miller details the rise and significance of Black dandyism in her book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\u201d The novel tracks the early days of Black dandyism to Enlightenment England \u2014 a period between the 17th and 18th centuries that emphasized logic and freedom of thought \u2014 and touches on historical figures, like the formerly enslaved Julius Soubise, a musician who became involved in London\u2019s 18th century social scene, and more modern artists such as Yinka Shonibare, a British scholar whose work discusses the relationship between Africa and Europe.",
      "In February, the Council of Fashion Designers of America published a story about Black dandyism that highlighted some current day examples, including co-chair Colman Domingo and Met Gala host committee member Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "The not-for-profit association, which includes over 450 American fashion and accessory designers as members, spoke to Darnell-Jamal Lisby, fashion historian and assistant curator of The Cleveland Museum of Art, about how Black dandyism separates itself from dandyism.",
      "\u201cBlack dandyism aligns with traditional dandyism but carries an organic self-expression that transcends societal norms,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the African American context, it began with respectability in politics before evolving into a revolutionary statement. Figures like Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois used refined imagery to challenge racist narratives. By the 1920s, Black men reinterpreted Eurocentric fashion through their own lens, blending respectability with rebellion, a dynamic that continues to shape Black menswear today.\u201d",
      "Lisby mentioned zoot suits in particular, which feature high-waisted, billowy pants.",
      "\u201cInitially, they were not a political act, but became one when mainstream society criminalized the look. Black men\u2019s bodies have long been policed, and deviating from white norms only heightened that scrutiny. Yet, they embraced the style as their own,\u201d he said.",
      "What are some examples of Black dandyism?",
      "In 2017, Paper Magazine spoke to author Shantrelle P. Lewis about her book \u201cDandy Lion: The Black Dandy and Street Style,\u201d which shines a light on designers, tailors and events that have shaped contemporary Black dandyism.",
      "After referencing how Miller\u2019s book chronicled the trajectory of Black dandyism, Lewis noted in the interview how Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois were early examples of Black dandyism.",
      "\u201cI think in an earlier era, it was deeply rooted in respectability,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt then reflected scholastic rigor and self- respect \u2014 think Malcolm X and his sharp suits or James Baldwin.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cToday, dandyism is a more recent manifestation of hip hop culture. Black dandies are using hip hop methods of sampling to mix styles and articles of clothing from different eras and cultures to articulate statements of Black masculinity and individuality.\u201d",
      "What might some celebs wear at the 2025 Met Gala?",
      "Fashion fans should expect this year\u2019s 2025 Met Gala red carpet to be decorated with colorful menswear.",
      "As Lewis explained to Paper Magazine, color is reflected in dandy culture all over the world.",
      "\u201cWithin the Black community, color serves as a continuum of expressiveness and meaning present in the African aesthetic. You see pops of color that reflects the vibrancy of African Diasporan people internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s loud, it\u2019s disruptive, it\u2019s flamboyant and filled with self respect and pride. It takes a lot of confidence to strut down the street dressed in a bright sky blue ankara fabric jacket. That color is often pleasurable for the wearer as it is for the observer.\u201d",
      "Many celebrities will likely arrive in black tie and white tie, a hat, which is very common in Black dandyism, and statement jewelry.",
      "Our eyes will be on the co-chairs, who regularly sport outfits inspired by Black dandyism at Hollywood events, to see how they take it to another level for the 2025 Met Gala."

At the time, it was assumed that they also had a triplet who died in childbirth.",
      "At the end of the film, Emily goes to prison for killing her sister and attempting to frame her husband Sean (Henry Golding) in a murder-suicide. She also shot Sean after she found out that he had slept with Stephanie when they believed that Emily had died.",

Stephanie is now a true crime author and promoting her new book, \u201cThe Faceless Blonde,\u201d chronicling her tumultuous and deadly time with Emily. During a book reading, a just-released-from-prison Emily shows up and asks her to be her maid of honor at her Italian wedding.",
      "What comes next are whirlwind and jaw-dropping moments, as well as some fantastic fashion ensembles from Lively, which makes for a thrilling adventure.",

      "She tries to meet up with not-so-undercover FBI Agent Irene Walker (Taylor Ortega), but the agent is soon killed by Charity.

      "Stephanie, who Emily used to call \"brother f-----,\" jokes that Charity is now a \"sister f-----\" after Emily's intimate encounter with her sister.",

      "Charity kills aunt Linda and goes to prison, pretending to be Emily",
      "When Stephanie and Emily find Charity, she is with aunt Linda who has a gun to Nick\u2019s head. Linda knew Dante\u2019s secret and was going to use it to blackmail his family for millions of dollars.",
      "Now that he's dead, Linda plans on killing Emily and having Charity take her place. However, Charity, who is enamored with Emily, agrees to it as long as, \u201cHope doesn\u2019t die,\u201d she says, using her sister's real name.",

      "What did 'Another Simple Favor' director Paul Feig say about the surprise ending?",
      "Director Paul Feig opened up about the wild and shocking ending, telling Entertainment Weekly that the final project deviated from the sequel's original script which had Emily's fianc\u00e9\u00a0Dante as \"more of a bad guy.\"",
      "\u201cIt turned out that he was a bad guy and he staged his death, and they had to go on the run because Emily was like, \u2018They\u2019re going to kill me. He set me up to look like I killed him,\u201d Feig explained.",
      "While the original idea was \"more of a caper\" with Emily undercover and dressing like a nun and a \"normal person,\" Feig called the new version more of a mystery.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a mystery in real life, everybody jumps to their conclusion,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought, \u2018God, if people had the ability to arrest people, there\u2019d be a lot of people getting falsely accused and arrested.\u2019 Everybody thinks they know people\u2019s motives.\u201d",
      "The director also commented on Emily's altruistic decision about the custody of her son Nicky after the fallout from her crimes and her sister's recent murders.",
      "\u201cEmily knows that she\u2019s a well-meaning mother, but she\u2019s probably not the best example to bring up a child,\u201d Feig said. \u201cI respect that she has the smarts to do that now that Sean is gone. She does the selfless thing, if you will.\u201d",
      "Will there be a 'A Simple Favor 3'?",
      "While director Paul Feig has yet to confirm another sequel to \"A Simple Favor,\" the \"Bridesmaids\" director said \"Another Simple Favor\" does leave the door open for a continuation of the story.",
      "\u201cCharity is a loose cannon,\u201d Feig told EW. \u201cSo there are lots of places for her to go. Let\u2019s just say, I hope to see Charity again.\u201d",
      "With the film having an open ending, in which viewers aren't privy to the \"simple favor\" that Dante\u2019s mother, Portia, asks of Emily, Feig explained to EW that the ideas for a follow up are \u201call sitting right there to be picked off the tree.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook, as much as I don\u2019t like to do sequels and have avoided them, I have no rule against three-quels,\" he said. \"There\u2019s much more fun to be had with these characters and to see what they can get into and how they can get out of it.\u201d",
      "So what exactly is that \"simple favor\" that Emily has been tasked with?",
      "Feig teased \u201cit\u2019s something that probably nobody else in the family would want to do.\u201d",
      "\"Another Simple Favor\" is now available to stream on Prime Video."

      "The reporter, Ed Potton, described in his published piece how the  interview went \"off the rails\" after he brought up the fact that Goggins and Wood, 31, who played love interests \"The White Lotus,\" no longer follow each other on  Instagram.",

      "Though the conversation pivoted to Goggins' upcoming movie, \"The Uninvited,\" written and directed by Goggins' wife Nadia Conners, it eventually made its way to a recent \"Saturday Night Live\" parody of \"The White Lotus,\" which was slammed for poking fun at Wood's appearance.",

He said yes!\u201d",

Every day, I find a few new shingles on the ground next to the cabin, and one day, I\u2019m fairly sure I\u2019ll sit on my living room sofa and look straight up to see the moon.",
      "And then a few days ago, my calls became more urgent. There\u2019s a storm coming, and if this roof doesn\u2019t get fixed ASAP, I could die. So I told Rudy he needed to get his butt over here \u2014 now. I wasn\u2019t nice, but I said what I had to say.",

He\u2019s a scrawny man in his late 50s who looks like he only eats one or two nonliquid meals per day. He scratches the gray stubble on his chin and adjusts the worn gray baseball cap he always wears. As usual, he reeks of cigarette smoke. The stench of it was overpowering when I first moved into the cabin, and it took me a week to get it aired out. It still clings to some of the furniture months later.",

As much as I enjoy roughing it a bit, I very much did not want to build my own septic system. So here I am, not living off the grid \u2014 I have electricity, running hot and cold water, and a working landline telephone \u2014 but I do not have a television, and I look back with disdain on the days when my smartphone was glued to my right hand. I sold the phone before I came out here.",

      "\u201cI had to check it out first, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Rudy takes another drag from his cigarette. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it when the storm is over, okay? Next week.\u201d",
      "He doesn\u2019t give me a specific day or time, which is par for the course. Undoubtedly, he\u2019ll call me with an hour\u2019s notice, and if I happen to be out, then my roof just won\u2019t get fixed that day. I\u2019ll have to annoy him as much as I can to make sure this gets done.",

      "I shoot him a look. On a scale of one to 10, Rudy gets a two on the landlord scale. Not only does he never answer my messages, but he refuses to believe there\u2019s a problem with anything. When the refrigerator randomly stopped working a few months ago, his response was, Well, it was working when you moved in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried about that tree,\u201d I tell him.",

      "\u201cAnd why are you worried about the tree?\u201d he asks me in a patronizing voice.",
      "I stomp over to the culprit in my waterproof boots and press my palm against its bark. In response to the pressure, the tree groans threateningly and shifts over about two inches.",

      "\u201cSo trees aren\u2019t supposed to move like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes they do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, Rudy. They are inanimate.\u201d",
      "He takes a long drag from his cigarette, then blows out a giant cloud of smoke. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call a landscaper. Happy?\u201d",
      "No. I\u2019ll be happy when the tree is gone. I\u2019ve been worried about it for the last month, and now that a storm is coming, I\u2019m really worried.",
      "I look up at the roof of my house. It will probably hold. And the tree probably won\u2019t fall down. I probably won\u2019t die tonight.",

      "MANILA \u2014 On a balmy night outside Manila\u2019s Baclaran church, Gerald Concepcion, 32, and his fellow devotees were decorating a float of the Virgin Mary with fragrant lilies and pink carnations. He added artificial white doves to the arrangement, saying they were in honor of the late Pope Francis, who had led a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a testament that God is alive,\u201d Concepcion, a devout Catholic who works as a street vendor, told NBC News. \u201cHe accepted everyone, including us gay people who have long been marginalized.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 death on April 21 has opened the eternal tension between choosing a successor that represents continuity, or one who will bring change, including a possible return to the church\u2019s recent past of more conservative positions on issues like homosexuality.",
      "Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino cardinal often dubbed the \u201cAsian Francis\u201d for his emphasis on poor and marginalized people, has emerged as a possible leading contender, or papabile, when the conclave meets on May 7 to elect Francis\u2019 replacement.",
      "If chosen as pope, Tagle could carry with him some lessons from the Philippines. Despite being the biggest Catholic nation in Asia \u2014 about 80% of Filipinos are Catholic \u2014 and the third-largest in the world, it is also one of the more LGBTQ-friendly countries in the region.",
      "Many gay Catholics, like Concepcion, remain active and visible members of the church, and he says Tagle offers the possibility of continuing Francis\u2019 embrace of gay Catholics into the next papacy.",
      "\u201cBeing gay is not wrong because we were also created by God and all things that God created are beautiful,\u201d Concepcion added.",
      "The Philippine Catholic Church has become more open to gay Catholics in recent years, including in a 2024 position paper in which the church acknowledged the LGBTQ community\u2019s \u201cimportant role in the life of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.\u201d",
      "And while Tagle, who is known for avoiding provocative rhetoric and controversial issues, has rarely spoken publicly about homosexuality in his statements and homilies, he has lamented the church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d in the past about gay and divorced people. Filipino Catholics say they have felt supported by some of his actions and see them as potential signs of his approach to the community if he were to be elected pope.",
      "Edwin Valles, former president of Courage Philippines, an LGBTQ organization under the Archdiocese of Manila, says he is certain that Tagle would continue embracing the gay community.",
      "In 2014, Valles said he approached Tagle, then head of the Archdiocese of Manila, to request a priest to be assigned to guide their members, a request Tagle granted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment on his part,\u201d Valles said. \u201cHe puts money where his mouth is. So I like to think that he will also do the same if and when he becomes pope.\u201d",
      "Valles tells a story from a 2018 event they both attended, when a young faithful asked the cardinal about the status of LGBTQ Catholics.",
      "\u201cAnd his answer was something like: All of us are Catholics, all of us are parishioners, all of us are children of God. So why make that label and distinction? That just serves to separate or put people in boxes,\u201d Valles recalled Tagle saying.",
      "A man of the people",
      "The Jesuit-educated Tagle, 67, was born to a Filipino father and a Filipino Chinese mother who were both bankers, and Tagle grew up in a well-to-do family. He was ordained as a priest in 1982 at the age of 24, and like Francis, adopted a simple life.",
      "From 2001 to 2011, he served as the bishop of the Diocese of Imus, a city south of Manila, and his hometown. There, Tagle took to walking the streets, greeting street vendors and motorcycle taxi drivers. Residents affectionately recalled how Tagle would sit on a wooden bench outside a humble neighborhood barbershop, Bible in hand, his presence so regular that it earned Roland, the shopkeeper, the nickname, \u201cHoly Barber.\u201d",
      "Tagle then became Manila\u2019s archbishop in 2011 and was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. In 2015, he was elected president of Caritas Internationalis, the humanitarian and development organization of the Catholic Church, and was re-elected again in 2019. That year, he moved to the Vatican after Francis appointed him head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, the church\u2019s missionary arm.",
      "He would fly back to the Philippines, unannounced and without fanfare, to check on his ailing parents, have his hair cut by Roland, and make surprise visits to neighbors and relatives eager to receive a blessing from a cardinal back home from the Vatican.",
      "He \u2018does not possess a prophetic voice\u2019",
      "Tagle is highly respected in the Philippines, where he is widely perceived as \u201cwarm, gentle, approachable, humble and at times funny,\u201d just like Francis, Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from the University of Santo Tomas, a Catholic university in Manila, told NBC News.",
      "As a top cleric, Tagle\u2019s pastoral approach \u201creflects a leader eager to serve and emphasize meeting the needs of his flock,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "But the similarities seemed to end there. Unlike Francis, who spoke with forceful, moral authority on worldly issues like exploitative capitalism or the injustices of war, Asiones said, Tagle \u201clacks or does not possess a prophetic voice.\u201d",
      "Tagle has been criticized for his inaction on sexual abuse by priests, and his silence on the extrajudicial killings ordered by the Philippines\u2019 former President Rodrigo Duterte, in a crackdown on drugs that left tens of thousands, including children, dead. Duterte openly attacked and threatened the church, which in the Philippines has historically stood up against political power.",
      "In the face of the flagrant human rights abuses, however, Tagle responded with statements Duterte\u2019s opponents criticized as vague and unchallenging.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Tagle will be entirely Francis 2.0. For one, he opts for political correctness, often avoiding confrontational language, and seems reticent, if not afraid, to hold truth to power,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "A good theologian, but a poor administrator",
      "Tagle has had significant experience in the Vatican, but observers say it has been far from stellar.",
      "In 2022, Francis dismissed Tagle and the rest of the leadership team of Caritas Internationalis after a Vatican-led audit found \u201creal deficiencies\u201d in management and procedures.",
      "What the Roman Curia needs is a pope who is also a good administrator, said Charles Collins, managing editor of Crux, an international publication focusing on the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cTagle is considered intelligent, a good theologian and a good communicator. But in many ways he has not been a very good administrator in some of the jobs he\u2019s had in the Vatican,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe has not proven himself in that role.\u201d",
      "Francis had shaken things up in the Vatican and the cardinals may look to someone who could provide stability to replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the conclave is going to look at a European cardinal to become pope,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Three issues are expected to hound the next pope: clerical abuse, poor finances of the Vatican and the ongoing cultural war between progressives and conservatives.",
      "Tagle might be one of the more popular papabili, but Collins cautioned that in every conclave, \u201cthere are always people who are being promoted more in the media than among the cardinals.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pope from Asia or Africa is a good news story, but that does not reflect the views of the cardinal electors.\u201d",
      "Camille Elemia reported from Manila and Imus, Philippines."

      "In 2010, a flotilla on a similar mission was stopped and boarded by Israeli troops near the coast of Gaza. Israeli forces' use of force resulted in the deaths of nine people on board and multiple others were wounded, a panel established by the U.N. secretary general said.",
      "Since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led terrorist attacks, more\u00a0than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, whose numbers are described as reliable by the World Health Organization.",

      "Israel attacked a target near the presidential palace in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early Friday, reiterating his vow to protect members of the Druze community.",
      "It marks the\u00a0second time\u00a0Israel has struck Syria in as many days, following through on a promise to defend the minority group, which was involved in sectarian violence against Sunni gunmen earlier this week.",
      "The Druze adhere to a faith that is an offshoot of Islam and have followers in Syria, Lebanon and Israel.",
      "The strikes reflect Israel\u2019s deep mistrust of the Sunni Islamists who toppled Bashar al-Assad in December, posing a further challenge to interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa\u2019s efforts to establish control over the fractured nation.",
      "\u201cIsrael struck last night near the presidential palace in Damascus,\u201d Netanyahu said in a joint statement with Defense Minister Israel Katz.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear message to the Syrian regime: We will not allow (Syrian) forces to deploy south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement that it struck \u201cadjacent to the area of the Palace of\u00a0Ahmed\u00a0Hussein al-Sharaa in Damascus,\u201d without specifying the target. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities.",
      "Since Assad was ousted in December, Israel has seized ground in the southwest, vowed to protect the Druze, lobbied Washington to keep the neighboring state weak, and has blown up much of the Syrian army\u2019s heavy weapons in the days after he was toppled.",
      "Sharaa, who was an Al Qaeda commander before renouncing ties to the group in 2016, has repeatedly vowed to govern Syria in an inclusive way. But incidents of sectarian violence, including the\u00a0killing of hundreds of Alawites in March, have hardened fears among minority groups about the now dominant Islamists.",
      "This week\u2019s sectarian violence began on Tuesday with clashes between Druze and Sunni gunmen in the predominantly Druze area of Jaramana, set off by a voice recording cursing the Prophet Mohammad and which the Sunni militants suspected was made by a Druze.",
      "More than a dozen people were reported killed on Tuesday, before the violence spread to the mainly Druze town of Sahnaya on the outskirts of Damascus on Wednesday."

    "story": [
      "Before this week's federal election in Canada, Derek Ouellette and his wife, Yecenia Ouellette, could never have imagined voting for anyone but a Conservative.",
      "\u201cWe were both raised Conservative and we both kind of thought, Conservative is just what you do,\u201d Derek Ouellette, a 46-year-old insurance broker from Belle River, near Windsor, Ontario, said in a phone interview late Tuesday.",
      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",
      "His campaign, during which he focused on small-government and libertarian issues, combined with dissatisfaction at the scandal-hit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the economy to see the Conservatives move 24 points ahead of the Liberals in January, according to a poll tracker run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",
      "As anti-Trump sentiment grew across Canada, Poilievre's own bullish rhetoric rapidly lost its sheen for many Canadian Conservatives.",
      "When Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, was named Canada\u2019s interim prime minister and the Liberal candidate for the 2025 election, distaste for Trudeau and worries about the Liberals' ability to handle the economy quickly evaporated.",
      "When it did, a new way forward emerged for those who had felt politically homeless.",
      "Poilievre, now the former leader of the opposition, even lost the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades to a Liberal neophyte Monday.",
      "'Maple MAGA'",
      "\u201cListening to Poilievre speak, it\u2019s like talking points from Trump,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cIt just reeks of what\u2019s happening south of the border.\u201d",
      "By comparison, he added, Carney \u201chas shown himself to be very decisive in dealing with Trump\u201d by billing himself as candidate who could stand up to the president.",
      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",
      "Dugdale said she found parallels between Poilievre\u2019s campaign and support base, and Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement particularly off-putting.",
      "\u201cWe need unity. We need to be together. We need positive messaging,\u201d said Dugdale, who is from Barrie, just north of Toronto, and works in marketing and sales.",
      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",
      "And while lifelong Conservatives may have helped propel the Liberal leader forward, Paris said he believed \u201cMark Carney would likely not have won if not for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cCanadians were tired of the Liberal Party after 10 years, but they were even more concerned about Trump\u2019s threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dugdale pointed out, the election\u2019s projected outcome was a far cry from the Conservative victory that felt increasingly certain just weeks ago, with Poilievre now out of a job.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so ironic. Paul [Poilievre] was shouting, \u2018we need change,\u2019\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cHe got change alright.\u201d"

      "The Labor Party pulled ahead of the\u00a0conservative Liberal-National coalition, led by Peter Dutton, with the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s early projections suggesting at least 70\u00a0of the 150 House seats for Labor, according to the Australian broadcaster ABC.",
      "\u201cNot the night we wanted,\u201d Dutton said at his party headquarters, adding that he had congratulated Albanese on his win.",
      "Independent candidates and minor parties are projected to take about 13 seats in parliament, which means Albanese may have to form a coalition if the final count shows that his party ultimately falls short of a parliamentary majority.",
      "Concerns among Australians over the soaring cost of living and the lack of affordable housing dominated the election at a time when interest rates remain high. Geopolitical relations with China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, were also front of mind for voters.",
      "But voters in this election were more concerned by Trump\u2019s shake-up of the global order with a new trade regime that slapped a 10% tariff on all Australian exports to the U.S.",
      "A survey published Wednesday by Australian think tank the Lowy Institute found that over 60% of Australians did not have any level of trust in the U.S. to act responsibly.",
      "Albanese, 62, rose to the top job in 2022, ending nine years of conservative rule. Spotlighting his working-class credentials, his party in this election promised\u00a0tax cuts,\u00a0help for young homebuyers, and a pledge of $5.5 billion more for health care.",
      "Until recently, the Australian leader\u00a0faced the prospect of becoming the country\u2019s first single-term prime minister in almost a century, bogged down by high inflation, a slowing economy, and a housing crisis put into sharp relief by Albanese\u2019s ill-timed purchase of a multimillion-dollar cliff-top home.",
      "After Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, Dutton, 54, who was leading the polls against his rival Albanese, saw a turnaround in popularity after many of his party\u2019s campaign promises, including on immigration, were seen as widely emulating Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "In the lead-up to the election, Liberal Party insiders told Reuters that the anti-Trump sentiment was spurring risk-averse voters to move away from Dutton at the ballot box.",
      "Trump had been \u201ca wrecking ball\u201d for Australia\u2019s conservative coalition, said Andrew Carswell, the former press secretary to Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who lost office in the previous\u00a0election, according to Reuters.",
      "Albanese, meanwhile, refrained from mentioning Trump on the campaign trail, instead telling voters on Monday, \u201cThe last thing you need is a volatile government.\u201d",
      "He has avoided direct criticism of the president in favor of a security alliance with the U.S., though he was notably absent from Trump\u2019s inauguration and has yet to visit Washington.",

      "\u201cWe are grateful once again for your strong mandate. We will honor the trust you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,\u201d Wong said in a speech earlier to his constituency before the full results were out.",
      "Eugene Tan, a law professor at the Singapore Management University, said the opposition\u2019s failure to make further inroads after 2020 was a surprise. \u201cSingapore voters played their cards close to their chest. Today, they indicated that their trust is with a party that has delivered over the years,\u201d he said.",
      "A U.S.-trained economist who is also finance minister, Wong\u2019s appeal for a resounding mandate to steer trade-reliant Singapore through economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes has hit home. The government has lowered its growth forecast and warned of a possible recession.",
      "Wong, 52, succeeded Lee Hsien Loong to become the city-state\u2019s fourth leader. Lee stepped down in May 2024 after two decades at the helm but remained in the Cabinet as a senior minister. His retirement as premier ended a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world\u2019s richest nations during 31 years in office.",
      "The PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity, but tight government control and the rising cost of living in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities also has led to growing unhappiness, especially among younger voters. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding and restrictions on free speech have loosened the PAP\u2019s grip on power.",
      "The opposition says giving it a stronger presence in Parliament will allow a more balanced political system and greater accountability. But they face an uphill task, often hamstrung by a lack of resources, fragmented support and a lack of unity. Critics said gerrymandering also gives the PAP an advantage.",
      "Pritam Singh, leader of the Workers Party, acknowledged it was a tough contest and vowed to continue the fight for a more balanced Parliament. \u201cThe slate is wiped clean, we start work again tomorrow, and we go again,\u201d he said.",
      "While the Workers Party failed to expand its presence, it had consolidated its support with increased share vote in some areas, said Southeast Asia political analyst Bridget Welsh. Other smaller opposition parties however, failed to make a breakthrough.",
      "Welsh said voters opted for stability amid concerns over global volatility due to sweeping U.S. tariffs. Wong\u2019s more approachable leadership in engaging younger voters and efforts to renew PAP by bringing in about a-third of new faces also helped swung votes, she said.",
      "\u201cI call this the Wong and Trump effect,\u201d she said. \u201cThe issue of economic insecurity really did reinforce his mandate.\u201d"

      "As in Canada, Australia\u2019s opposition conservative party, the Coalition, was primed to win before Trump returned to office, thanks to public anger over the cost of living and record-high home prices. But it has since lost support among voters increasingly concerned about how their government will handle Trump.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s \u201chyperrealist, short-term, transactional approach to its relationships is deeply unsettling and corrosive of goodwill,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has treated Australia as just another freeloader, slapping a 10% tariff on all exports to the U.S., even though the U.S. generally runs a trade surplus with Australia rather than a deficit. (In a rare deviation, Australia reported Thursday that it sold more to the U.S. than it bought in the first quarter as investors spooked by Trump\u2019s tariffs rushed to buy gold, one of Australia\u2019s top metals exports.)",
      "While 81% of Australians disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the vast majority (80%) continue to say the U.S. alliance is important for Australia\u2019s security.",
      "Those numbers reflect the economic and security dichotomy Australia faces: how to balance its security ties with the U.S. and its trade interests with China.",

      "China is Australia\u2019s largest two-way trading partner, accounting for 25% of the country\u2019s goods and services trade in 2023-24. The U.S. is Australia\u2019s third-largest two-way trading partner and largest source of foreign investment.",
      "If the United States, which has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, \u201creally damages the Chinese economy, then that is going to have a major impact on Australia,\u201d said Stuart Rollo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.",
      "Rollo said he worries Australia could be caught in the middle if the U.S. tries to pressure its allies to reduce their economic ties with Beijing.",

      "\u201cFor us to make the decision to disconnect from that \u2014 because we need American protection forever \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a real cost to the living standards of Australians moving forward.\u201d",
      "Without the U.S., however, Australia would be cut off from critical military technology and far less protected against Chinese aggression.",
      "Australia\u2019s vulnerability was on display in February when the Chinese military conducted live-fire drills off the country\u2019s coast, forcing dozens of commercial flights to reroute.",
      "That\u2019s why Australian politicians on both sides of the aisle say they remain committed to AUKUS, the security pact among Australia, the U.S. and Britain, even as Australians question whether they can still rely on the U.S. for their defense.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re this kind of Anglo, European-transplanted community sitting on the edge of Asia, and [that] drives our fear of abandonment, which drives us towards the United States,\u201d Blaxland said.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia is set to buy several nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. as a deterrent against China.",
      "But Australia would struggle to pay for those submarines without its trade relationship with China, said James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\u201cThis is a big cost problem for a small economy like Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t go all in on AUKUS, all in on the United States, all in on containing China and imagine that our trade with China, which is paying for our submarines, can actually be sustained. It can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Both Albanese and Dutton have downplayed any uncertainty around U.S. relations, but Laurenceson believes cracks are emerging in bipartisan support for the alliance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll say that our security alliance with the U.S. is much more than just about one administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true, but Trump is certainly challenging that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 After losing a legal battle over his lack of publicly funded security, Prince Harry on Friday expressed a desire to rebuild his strained relationship with the Royal Family.",
      "\u201cI would love\u00a0reconciliation\u00a0with my family. ... There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight people,\u201d Harry told the BBC. \u201cIt would be nice to have that\u00a0reconciliation\u00a0part now. If they don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s entirely up to them.\u201d",
      "Harry's interview with the BBC came after he lost his appeal against the U.K. government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly funded security detail, an issue that he says has driven a wedge between him and his father.",
      "\u201cHe won\u2019t speak to me because of this security stuff,\u201d Harry said, adding that he didn\u2019t know how long his father had left to live. King Charles III, from whom Harry says he is currently cut off, was diagnosed with cancer last year.",
      "And without security, Harry said, \u201cI can\u2019t see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the U.K. at this point.\u201d",
      "Charles' second son\u2019s protection was downgraded in February 2020 when he stepped down as a full-time member of the royal family and moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. That meant the British state provided security on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Harry, who is the fifth in line to the throne, had argued that the body responsible for protecting the Royal Family was not following its own rules, that all high-profile members of the Royal Family, like the king and his brother Prince William, have around-the-clock protection.",
      "The Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, made the decision on his security arrangements after he and Meghan stepped down from being a working member of the Royal Family in 2020. Currently, his security in the U.K. is decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country\u2019s other high-profile visitors.",
      "After the ruling Friday, a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace said \u201cAll of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\u201d",
      "In their ruling Friday, judges Lord Justice David Bean, Lord Justice Andrew Edis and Sir Geoffrey Vos dismissed his appeal.",
      "Harry \u201cwas in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec,\u201d Sir Geoffrey Vos told the court.",
      "\u201cOutside the U.K. he was outside the cohort, but when in the U.K. his security would be considered as appropriate depending on the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was imposssible, I said in my judgement to say that this reasoning was illogical or innappropriate. Indeed it seemed sensible,\u201d he added.",
      "In an earlier written submission to the court, his legal team said that Harry \u201cinherited a security risk at birth, for life.\u201d It added that he \u201cserved two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\u201d",
      "Harry and his wife felt \u201cforced to step back\u201d from their roles \u201cas they considered they were not being protected by the institution,\u201d it said.",
      "Harry has said he and his family were under particular threat because of the abuse his wife receives from some sections of the public and the media, which he has said are racially motivated.",
      "Rejecting his challenge in February 2024, Britain\u2019s High Court said the decision to change Harry\u2019s security status was neither irrational nor procedurally unfair. Two months later he lost the right to appeal the ruling, although that was later overturned.",
      "Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police force to guard him while he is in the U.K. after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cprivate bodyguards for the wealthy.\u201d",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s company, News Group Newspapers, agreed to pay \u201csubstantial damages\u201d to Harry after settling a long-running legal battle. NGN admitted that between 1996 and 2011, staff on The Sun newspapers used unlawful methods to dig up private information about Harry and his late mother, Princess Diana.",
      "The duke is also among a group of celebrities suing another publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), which prints the Daily Mail, accusing it of lawbreaking in its attempts to gather information on them. The trial is due to start next year.",
      "In 2023, he dropped a libel case against ANL for its coverage of his legal battle over personal security. And the same year, he was awarded 140,600 pounds ($179,350) after successfully bringing a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers."
