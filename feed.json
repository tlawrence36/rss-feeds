      "That won\u2019t be an issue this year.",
      "MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the NBA champion Thunder will be working at home for Christmas this season, playing host to Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs as part of the league\u2019s annual Dec. 25 quintupleheader. BetMGM Sportsbook has the Thunder favored by 9.5 points.",
      "The other Christmas games, released by the NBA on Tuesday: Cleveland at New York (favored at -2.5), Houston at LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers (-1.5), No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg and Dallas visiting Golden State (-4.5), and Minnesota playing at Denver (-4.5).",
      "Some NBA Cup games are scheduled to be released Wednesday and the full schedule \u2014 80 of the 82 games for all teams \u2014 is to be released on Thursday. The remaining two games for each club will be filled in December based on how teams fare in the NBA Cup.",
      "\u201cThey make the schedule. We play it,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said last season, when asked about his club not being picked for the Dec. 25 lineup. \u201cOur players, I know, would have liked to play on Christmas because that\u2019s such a staple day in the NBA season. But we can\u2019t control that.\u201d",
      "Well, they sort of did control their Christmas scheduling fate this season.",
      "The NBA champions typically get invited to play on Christmas the following season; Oklahoma City beat Indiana in a seven-game NBA Finals last season. The Eastern Conference champion Pacers are among the Christmas snubs this year, after losing Tyrese Haliburton to an Achilles tear that will sideline him for the entirety of this season and seeing Myles Turner opt to sign with Milwaukee in free agency.",
      "The Knicks will be playing their 58th Christmas game, extending their NBA record. The first Christmas game in league history was at Madison Square Garden in 1947.",
      "Boston, Philadelphia and Phoenix played on Christmas last season and didn\u2019t make the Dec. 25 cut this season, replaced by Cleveland (which was the East\u2019s No. 1 seed), Houston (which landed Kevin Durant in an offseason blockbuster from the Suns) and the Thunder.",
      "Cleveland and the Thunder are playing on Christmas for the first time since 2018. The Rockets have a Christmas game for the first time since 2019.",

      "NEW YORK -- Look what you made her do \u2014 Taylor Swift has announced her 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d",
      "Swift announced the album on her website shortly after a countdown timer expired at 12:12 a.m. Tuesday. No release date was announced, but her site said vinyl editions of the album would ship before Oct. 13.",
      "Fans have long theorized that Swift's 12th album would soon arrive. On Monday, Taylor Nation \u2014 an official branch of the pop superstar\u2019s marketing team \u2014 posted a TikTok slide show of 12 images with the caption \u201cThinking about when she said 'See you next era\u2026'\u201d Swift is seen wearing orange in every image.",
      "A special limited vinyl edition of the album will be released in \u201cPortofino orange glitter,\" according to a pre-order page on her site. A special cassette edition is also available for pre-order.",
      "Sensing a pattern, eagle-eyed fans noticed that 12 minutes earlier, the popular \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast posted a tease for Wednesday. The show, hosted by Swift's boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce alongside his brother, former Eagles center Jason Kelce, posted an orange image on social media with a mysterious silhouette, many believing to be Swift.",
      "The podcast announced early early Tuesday that Swift would would appear on \u201cNew Heights\u201d and a teaser video posted about her appearance showed her pulling the album from a briefcase. The actual album artwork, just as it is on her website, is blurred.",

      "The album is also her first release since Swift regained control over her entire body of work. In May, that pop star said she purchased her catalog of recordings \u2014 originally released through Big Machine Records \u2014 from their most recent owner, the private equity firm Shamrock Capital. She did not disclose the amount.",
      "In recent years, Swift has been rerecording and releasing her first six albums in an attempt to regain control of her music. The project was instigated by Hybe America CEO Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift\u2019s effort to control her own songs and how they\u2019re used. Previous \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d releases have been more than conventional re-recordings, arriving with new \u201cfrom the vault\u201d music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work.",
      "So far, there have been four rerecorded albums, beginning with \u201cFearless (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cRed (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d in 2021. All four have been massive commercial and cultural successes, each one debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Swift\u2019s last rerecording, \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

It made $70 million internationally.",
      "The film\u2019s success also handed its distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures, the seventh No. 1 opening of the year, and became the studio\u2019s sixth film in a row to debut with over $40 million domestically.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Disney\u2019s chaotic sequel to the 2003 classic, \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d took the second spot during its premiere weekend, earning $29 million in 3,975 North American theaters.

      "\u201cWeapons\u201d transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The town is left to navigate the lingering effects of trauma through horror, paranoia and a touch of existential humor.",
      "The film is Cregger\u2019s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, \u201cBarbarian.\u201d That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre.",

      "The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. The superhero movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut, but stumbled in its second weekend.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d which got a healthy start at the No. 2 spot during its premiere weekend, came in fourth place, earning $10.4 million domestically. \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d had a similar fate, reaching the fifth position with $8.4 million in North American theaters.",

      "In Starz's \u201cOutlander,\u201d Caitriona Balfe's Claire Fraser is bold and brave. She can also think on her feet in high-pressure moments. Her husband Jamie Fraser, played by Sam Heughan, is protective and empathetic. In a new prequel series out Friday, called \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d we see how they each got that way.",
      "\u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d tells the love story of Jamie's parents, Ellen and Brian, and Claire's parents, Julia and Henry. The characters are inspired by the stories of Diana Gabaldon but there are no novels for showrunner Matthew B. Roberts to follow. He also is the showrunner of the original series, which debuts its final season early next year.",
      "With no source material \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more room to play in,\" explained Roberts. In \u201cOutlander,\u201d \"there are all these tentpole moments that we have to write to because that\u2019s what our audience wants from the books.\u201d",

      "The big obstacle facing Jamie\u2019s parents, Ellen and Brian, who meet in 18th century Scotland \u2014 is that they come from families that \u201cdon\u2019t get on,\u201d said Harriet Slater, who plays Ellen. \u201cThey don\u2019t mix.

      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed\u2019s band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",

      "NEW YORK (RNS) \u2014 On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand\u2011claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. The borough still has a church on nearly every block, but over the years, the number of people in the pews has thinned.",
      "Many church choirs in the heart of Brooklyn, however, have kept singing \u2014 despite boasting fewer singers than in years past as neighborhoods face gentrification and organized religious affiliation decreases.",
      "Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard \u201cGod Is\u201d on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as \u201cjoy in sorrow\u201d and \u201cstrength for tomorrow.\u201d Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.'",
      "As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,\u201d said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she\u2019s been a congregant for six years. \u201cI really feel sometimes like it\u2019s not just me singing, it\u2019s my lineage singing.\u201d",

      "Founded in 1847, Concord Baptist Church is Brooklyn\u2019s oldest historically Black congregation. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center.",
      "Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today.",
      "\"The songs that uplifted us and kept us going through the midst of our misery \u2014 music is who we are,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.\u201d",
      "According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% \u2014 the largest decline among major U.S. religious groups. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, and its impact is visible in the thinning choir stands.",
      "Glenn McMillan, Concord\u2019s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish.",
      "\u201cIn the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,\u201d McMillan said. The choir at Concord has shrunk from about 50 voices before the pandemic to 30 today, McMillan said. Back in 2006, the choir featured 100 voices.",
      "According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in\u2011person worship.",
      "\u201cThe internet has taken over and streaming has taken over,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.\u201d",
      "McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen more people showing up.",

      "\u201cIt was a lot of energy,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYour ear got trained really well.\u201d",
      "Today, Davis said, a typical service attracts approximately 150 people, and roughly 100 virtually. Over time, Berean\u2019s choirs have consolidated into a single mass choir with approximately 20 singers.",
      "A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in high school, I had music every day,\u201d said Davis, who attended high school in the 1970s in central Brooklyn. \u201cI don\u2019t think the children are learning notes and sharps and clefs. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.\u201d",
      "During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFor me, singing is not just singing, it\u2019s ministry,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSome of these old hymns were composed years and years ago, and those old hymns have sustained a people \u2014 many people.\u201d",
      "Gentrification is another force reshaping Brooklyn. Between 2010 and 2020, Crown Heights lost nearly 19,000 Black residents while gaining about 15,000 whites, according to 2020 Census data. More than 75% of Bedford-Stuyvesant residents in 2000 were Black, while in 2020, around 41% were Black.",
      "Those demographic shifts have hit historically Black Catholic parishes hard. St. Teresa of Avilain Crown Heights, which was the first church in the nation to hold Mass in Creole, will close by the end of the year. The anticipated closure demonstrates a wider pattern of Catholic churches that serve people of color closing, often attributed to declining attendance.",
      "For Mike Delouis, 38, St. Teresa\u2019s longtime cantor and a son of Haitian immigrants who was baptized at the church, the loss is personal.",
      "\u201cSinging for me is not about performance but about participation,\u201d said Delouis, who juggles three services most Sundays between St. Teresa and the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. \u201cSt. Augustine said singing is praying twice.\u201d",
      "Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. \u201cEven through the process of gentrification, there are people that hear the music and they come in,\u201d he said.",
      "In June, from his place in the choir loft, Delouis heard the priest announce the church\u2019s closure. The words hit hard. \u201cIt was actually kind of hard to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, no \u2014 we can\u2019t let this happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. She began singing at age 6 in the junior choir, and when she turned 18, she transitioned to its Gratitude choir, which her older siblings also joined. \u201cIt was the young hip gospel choir of the church,\u201d Walters said.",
      "Today, Gratitude no longer exists in the same way. Its members are older and often reunite only for special occasions, such as singing at funerals. Over the decades, Walters has also watched the congregation itself shift demographics.",
      "\"When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,\u201d Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. \u201cIn the years that would come, itwas primarily a Black church.\u201d It later became home to a large West Indian population, and today includes many members of Guyanese heritage.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I couldn\u2019t break down the history of Brooklyn in a way that says who came first,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other\u2019s pain and celebrate each other\u2019s joys.\u201d",
      "McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. \u201cChoir singers are some of the most faithful churchgoers,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cA choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.\u201d",
      "Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to follow in that tradition,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Many of President Donald Trump's picks to be federal judges have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions",
      "CHICAGO -- One called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice.\u201d Another referred to himself as a \u201czealot\u201d for the anti-abortion movement. Several have played prominent roles in defending their state's abortion restrictions in court and in cases that have had national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has offered shifting positions on the issue while indicating he wants to leave questions of abortion access to the states. But his court nominees will have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations \u201care a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,\u201d she said.",
      "Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any of Trump's judicial nominees support increased access to abortion.",
      "\"Every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling,\" a White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, said in a statement that referenced the 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump\u2019s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d",
      "Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. By the end of that term, more than one-quarter of active federal judges were nominated by Trump, including three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. Among them, four nominees are from Missouri and five are from Florida.",
      "Here is a look at the nominees who have tried to reduce abortion access or have advocated for restrictions. They did not respond to requests for comment:",
      "\u2014 Whitney Hermandorfer, who has been confirmed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has built much of her relatively short career as a lawyer around challenging former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies related to abortion and transgender rights. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked.",
      "Hermandorfer defended Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the country, in court and tried to dismiss a lawsuit from doctors seeking clarification on exemptions to the ban. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The case challenged the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone despite decades of evidence showing the drug is safe and effective.",
      "The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution\u2019s protections for religious freedom.",
      "\u2014 Jordan Pratt, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d and \u201cone of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable\u201d in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. The state now bans the procedure at six weeks.",
      "In 2025, Pratt struck down a Florida law that created a judicial waiver program for minors seeking to have abortions without parental consent. The lawyer also worked for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that opposes abortion and has sued to reverse the FDA approval of mifepristone.",

      "In his college newspaper, Divine described himself as a \u201czealot\" for the anti-abortion movement, referred to abortion as \u201cthe killing of an innocent, genetically unique human being\u201d and argued that life begins at fertilization.",
      "He also stepped into a prominent role in the fight over abortion rights in the state after Missouri voters approved an abortion rights amendment in 2024. That amendment did not immediately override state laws. It left it up to abortion rights groups to ask courts to knock down abortion restrictions they believed were now unconstitutional. During the ensuing legal battles, Divine represented the state in defending a host of abortion restrictions.",
      "\u2014 Chad Meredith, Trump's nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, defended the state's abortion ban and other restrictions while he was the state's chief deputy general counsel. That included a law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and describe images to abortion patients.",
      "\u2014 Bill Mercer, a Republican state lawmaker in Montana who is nominated for a U.S. District Court judgeship in the state, has repeatedly supported anti-abortion bills. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion.",
      "\u2014 Jennifer Mascott, a lawyer in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and a Trump nominee to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has spoken repeatedly about abortion law in panels and interviews.",
      "After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Mascott in an interview on \u201cFox News Live\u201d disagreed with the argument that the decision undermined the court\u2019s legitimacy. She said abortion issues are \u201cmore appropriately decided\u201d by the states, elected officials in Congress and people in their local communities.",
      "Anti-abortion groups said it is premature to make broad conclusions about whether the nominees would help carry out their policy goals but that they were optimistic based on the names they have seen so far.",

      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "HIROSHIMA, Japan -- When the United States dropped the atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, Ari Beser\u2019s grandfather was on board both of the American B-29 bombers that carried the weapons. On the ground, Kosuzu Harada\u2019s grandfather survived both attacks.",
      "Neither of the men \u2014 U.S. radar specialist Jacob Beser and Japanese engineer Tsutomu Yamaguchi \u2014 met during their lives. But both became staunch advocates of nuclear abolishment.",
      "Decades later, that shared goal has brought their grandchildren together. Ari Beser and Harada are telling their grandfathers\u2019 linked stories, and working to seek reconciliation and understanding about an attack that continues to divide people in Japan and the United States.",
      "During this week's commemoration of the 80th anniversaries of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks, the grandchildren visited a station in Hiroshima where Yamaguchi, badly injured, boarded a train back to his hometown of Nagasaki a day after the bombing on Aug. 6, 1945.",
      "The two grandchildren then went to the Hiroshima peace park where they spoke with The Associated Press about what their grandfathers experienced during two of the 20th century's most momentous events and their consequences.",
      "Yamaguchi was 29 when he was burned severely in the Hiroshima bombing. He was in the city on a temporary assignment as a shipbuilding engineer. After Yamaguchi arrived in Nagasaki, and was telling colleagues about the attack he had witnessed in Hiroshima, the second bomb exploded.",
      "Harada first learned about her grandfather\u2019s experience of both bombs when she interviewed him for an assignment in elementary school.",
      "Yamaguchi didn\u2019t talk about his experience in public until he was 90 because of worries about discrimination. He then became a vocal activist for peace until he died in 2010.",
      "In 2013, Harada learned that the grandson of an American who was on the planes that bombed both Hiroshima and Nagasaki wanted to hear about Yamaguchi's story.",
      "\u201cI had mixed feelings as a family member of the survivors,\u201d Harada said, recalling Ari Beser\u2019s first visit.",
      "Ari Beser quietly listened as Harada\u2019s mother talked about Yamaguchi.",
      "Harada and her mother were surprised when they learned that the senior Beser was exposed to radiation during his missions.",
      "\u201cWe used to see ourselves only from the victims\u2019 perspective,\" she said. \"We learned that war affects and ruins everyone\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel it is my role to keep telling about the horror ... so that the same mistake will never be repeated,\" Harada said.",
      "She visits places across Japan to talk about her grandfather's story and to push for a nuclear-free world.",
      "Yamaguchi used to say that he could never forgive the U.S. government for dropping the bombs, but he had no hatred for Americans. Even as his health deteriorated, Yamaguchi still spoke of his past, holding an interview from his hospital bed.",
      "Beser, a visual journalist and producer, has since regularly visited Nagasaki, and he and Harada have become friends.",
      "Harada believes the U.S. government should formally apologize for the bombings.",
      "\u201cA reconciliation takes time. It\u2019s a long process which takes generations,\u201d Harada said.",
      "When he was asked about the attacks during his first visit to Hiroshima 40 years ago, Jacob Beser didn't apologize, but said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was our proudest moment.\u201d He said the world needed to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",
      "At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1945, Jacob Beser was on the bomber Enola Gay approaching Hiroshima after a seven-hour flight from the Mariana Islands. The B-29 quickly descended from 32,000 feet (nearly 10,000 meters) to 1,820 feet (about 550 meters) and then dropped the bomb.",

      "PARIS -- Swimming in the Seine is an increasingly popular tourist attraction in the French capital \u2014 and a must-do for Parisians themselves. Thousands of people have enjoyed a dip in the river since three public bathing sites opened last month, the first in over a century.",
      "The swimming areas are expected to get even more crowded as a heatwave arrives in the region on Tuesday. Paris has been placed under \u201chigh vigilance\u201d by national weather service Meteo France, with temperatures up to 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) expected.",
      "At the Grenelle site in the west of Paris, visitors swim and sunbathe with a unique view of the Eiffel Tower, with small fishes darting near the surface.",
      "Water quality is tested daily to conform with European regulations. Swimming in the Seine had been illegal since 1923, with a few exceptions, due to pollution and risks posed by river navigation. The new bathing sites are possible following a 1.4 billion euro ($1.6 billion) cleanup that made it suitable for Olympic competitions last year.",
      "\u201cImagine that,\u201d said Constanze Martens, a tourist from Mexico. \u201cSwimming with view of the Eiffel Tower and in pure natural water, clean, safe, and with all this lovely people too, you have every age here.\"",
      "On Monday, the water temperature in the Seine was 22 degrees Celsius (71 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite warm, warmer than the sea, which was quite surprising, and is very pleasant,\u201d said Elisabeth Lorin, from the Paris eastern suburb of Montreuil.",
      "Until the end of August, bathing sites are open for free at scheduled times to anyone 10 or older or 14 or older, depending on the location. Details are in the Paris city hall website, in English as well. Each swimmer must be equipped with a yellow buoy, attached to their waist, for safety reasons. There are changing rooms with lockers.",
      "The site welcomes between 800 and 1,200 visitors per day, with a limit of 200 at any one time, said the manager of the Grenelle site, Yann For\u00eat.",
      "Paris Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan last week said over 40,000 people had swum at the sites since they opened on July 5. That's despite almost two weeks of closures largely due to rainy weather, which increases water pollution upstream.",
      "\u201cRight now, the water quality is excellent and we have optimal conditions with warm weather,\u201d Rabadan told The Associated Press on Monday. He said the daily decision to open the sites depends on weather conditions and factors including water flow rate and any known pollution.",

      "Marina Gicquel, a 22-year-old lifeguard at Grenelle, said the main difference from a swimming pool is the river current, along with the murky water.",
      "\u201cYou can only see people\u2019s heads sticking out. That\u2019s why buoys are useful,\u201d Gicquel said. \"And it\u2019s also quite deep. It\u2019s three to five meters (10 to 16 feet) deep, so people find no foothold.\u201d",
      "Some visitors, like Australian Thurkka Jeyakumar, had been skeptical about swimming in the Seine, citing the river\u2019s murky color and bacteria issues.",
      "Unsafe levels of E. coli or other bacteria appear during prolonged periods of rain that overwhelm pipes, leading untreated wastewater to flow into the river instead of a treatment plant. Last year, some Olympic competitions were postponed for that reason.",
      "In the end, Jeyakumar gave it a try because she lost a bet.",
      "\u201cFor the moment, I have to say that it was much nicer and cleaner than I thought it would be,\" she said. \"So the bet worked out for the better!\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Thailand\u2019s army warned that it may have to \u201cexercise the right of self-defense\u201d in response to continuing incidents it blames on Cambodia, in which Thai soldiers patrolling along the two countries\u2019 border have been wounded by land mines.",
      "A statement from Thai Army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree said a sergeant was patrolling the border with seven other soldiers Tuesday morning when he \u201dstepped on an anti-personnel landmine covertly planted by the Cambodian side, resulting in severe injuries to his left ankle.\u201d",
      "The incident and the Thai reaction indicates the precariousness of the ceasefire that took effect on July 29 with the aim of ending five days of armed clashes over disputed territory along their border. The fighting killed dozens of people on both sides, including civilians, and displaced more than 260,000.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s land mine incident was the fourth of its kind in about a month, and the second since the ceasefire. It took place about 1 kilometer (a half-mile) from Ta Muen Thom temple, which Thailand claims is located in its Surin province.",

      "In another disputed area Saturday, a Thai sergeant major suffered severe injuries, including losing his left foot, while two privates suffered lesser injuries.",
      "\u201cThis incident serves as clear evidence that the Cambodian side has violated the ceasefire agreement and shows no respect for international humanitarian law, particularly the Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use and placement of all types of anti-personnel landmines,\u201d said the Thai army statement about the latest incident.

      "The Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people formed in Colombia in 2001 to protect Indigenous territories from armed groups and from environmental destruction such as deforestation and illegal mining",
      "CALDONO, Colombia -- When Patricia Elago Zetty's 13-year-old son went missing in Colombia's conflict-ridden southwest, she didn't hesitate. Elago and five fellow members of the Indigenous Guard trekked across mountainous terrain to confront the guerrillas they suspected of taking her son and another teenager to bolster their ranks.",
      "When the unarmed Guard members reached the guerrillas' camp, about 30 fighters stopped them at gunpoint. After a tense wait, a tall commander stepped out from a gate, and Elago said she had come for her son. The commander said he would \u201cverify\u201d whether the boy was there.",
      "After about an hour of negotiations and radio calls, five more guerrillas arrived with her son Stiven and the other boy. When she saw Stiven, Elago said, it felt like her soul returned to her body.",
      "\u201cHe hugged me and said, \u2018Mom, I never thought you\u2019d risk so much,\u2019\u201d she said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt was a victory.\u201d",
      "Rescue missions like Elago's have intensified for the Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people, which formed in 2001 to protect Indigenous territories from armed groups and environmental destruction such as deforestation and illegal mining. Since 2020, as armed groups tightened their control of Nasa territory to expand illicit crops like marijuana and coca, those guerrillas have ramped up their recruitment of the region's children by dangling offers of cash and protection.",
      "Over eight days reporting in the Cauca region, the AP spoke to more than 20 young people affected by the recruitment as well as several families grappling with the same threat. Some youths had escaped, others were rescued, and a few chose to remain with the groups.",
      "Colombia has endured more than half a century of internal conflict fueled by inequality, land disputes and the drug trade. Leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and criminal groups have fought for control of territory \u2014 with rural, Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities caught in the crossfire. A 2016 peace deal ended the war with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, but violence never fully stopped.",
      "Since the accord, child recruitment has been driven mainly by FARC dissident groups who rejected the peace process. The ELN, a Marxist guerrilla force active since the 1960s, and the Clan del Golfo, Colombia\u2019s largest drug-trafficking gang, also forcibly recruit minors.",
      "Violence hangs heavy over the region. During AP\u2019s visit, two former FARC combatants who laid down arms under the peace deal were gunned down near Caldono. At the same time, families reported the disappearance of several youths \u2014 believed to have been recruited.",
      "This is the climate in which the Guard, known as Kiwe Thegnas in the Nasa Yuwe language, now works.",
      "For the Nasa, coca holds deep cultural, spiritual, and medicinal significance. Its exploitation to produce cocaine is seen by many as a distortion of a sacred plant \u2014 one that fuels violence and environmental destruction.",
      "Members of the Guard carry \u201cbastones de autoridad\u201d \u2014 sacred staffs symbolizing moral leadership and collective responsibility. The staffs are often adorned with the traditional Guard colors of red and green \u2014 which represent blood and earth \u2014 and emblems. Elago, 39, had a small photo of her son on hers.",
      "Steeped in spirituality, the staff is believed to offer protection from harm, giving Guard members the courage to confront armed groups. Yet more than 40 Guard members have been slain since the peace deal, according to Colombia\u2019s Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC), a longstanding organization representing Nasa and other Indigenous communities.",
      "\u201cThey carry guns \u2014 we carry staffs. The staff represents our life, our courage,\u201d Elago said. \u201cThey\u2019ve aimed their rifles at us \u2026 pressed them to our chests, to our heads.\u201d",
      "Elago said the rebels her group confronted three years ago expressed respect for the Guard but claimed the boys had joined voluntarily, which infuriated her. She said Stiven had left home the day he went missing to collect wages he was owed for farm work near a coca-growing area controlled by FARC dissidents.",
      "She said she challenged them: \u201cYou talk about respecting Indigenous people, but you\u2019re killing our youth. What respect is that?\u201d",
      "One rebel told her he'd never seen a mother speak so boldly. But another warned: \u201cTake care, mamma. You already smell like formaldehyde,\u201d a chemical used to preserve dead bodies.",
      "Not all rescues are successful.",
      "Eduwin Calambas Fernandez, coordinator of Kiwe Thegnas in Canoas, an Indigenous reserve in northern Cauca, described leading a 2023 attempt to bring back two teenagers recruited through Facebook. They met with commanders, only to find the 15- and 16-year-old boys did not want to return and were considered by the armed groups to be old enough to decide for themselves. Calambas said that the main armed faction in his area has declared it will no longer return recruits 14 or older to their families.",
      "Children are lured with promises of cash, cosmetic treatments, or food for their families, according to Indigenous Councils Association of Northern Cauca, or ACIN. Once inside the camps, many suffer physical abuse, political indoctrination and sexual violence \u2014 especially girls.",

      "Campbell called the Colombian government\u2019s response \u201cineffective and untimely,\u201d noting a lack of consistent state presence and failure to partner with Indigenous authorities on prevention.

Her small school in the village of Manuelico \u2014 reachable only by a winding road from Caldono \u2014 is surrounded by dense forest and coca fields planted and patrolled by armed groups. Banners promoting the Dagoberto Ramos front of the FARC \u2014 one of the most violent factions in Cauca \u2014 hang along the roadside.",
      "\u201cSince 2020, it\u2019s been very sad \u2014 threats, recruitment, killings \u2026 living in the middle of violence,\" Diaz said.",
      "Diaz has spent 14 years teaching across the Caldono municipality, but says only in this village, surrounded by coca, has the presence of armed groups felt so constant. Teachers \u201cwork with them breathing down our necks,\u201d she said.",
      "The Indigenous Guard has stepped up patrols outside the school to discourage recruiting. Diaz says the armed group members have come to the school to buy food, borrow chairs and interact casually with staff.",

      "One young woman who recently fled FARC dissidents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said she joined the armed group at 16 not because she was forced but to escape family problems.",
      "She said she mainly cooked, organized supplies and cleaned weapons. She was afraid at first but was not mistreated. She eventually fled after a change in commanders left her fearing harsher treatment or being moved to a faraway region with an increased threat of combat.",
      "Now she works with a local initiative that supports families trying to prevent their children from being recruited. She warns teens about the risks of joining armed groups.",
      "As for the parents, she said: \u201cI tell families they need to build trust with their children.\"",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez, a woman in her mid-30s who asked to be identified only by her last name for fear of reprisals, was 12 when armed men came looking for her in her rural Cauca community. Terrified, and with no clear way to say no, she joined the ranks of the FARC. In the years that followed, she said she endured rape, psychological abuse and starvation and saw brutal punishments against those who tried to escape.",
      "Her escape, three years after being taken, came by chance. One night, a commander sent her to charge a cell phone. Instead of returning, she hid for days in a nearby home, protected by civilians who risked their lives to shelter her, before fleeing the region.",
      "Now, raising three children in a village near Caldono, she watches and worries about her eldest son, now 12.",
      "\u201cYoung people are so easily fooled \u2026 they\u2019re shown a bit of money or a cell phone, and they think that\u2019s just how life works,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they\u2019re sent into combat zones where so many children die.\u201d",

      "Putin appeared to be on the verge of making a key territorial grab ahead of Friday\u2019s summit, potentially to use as leverage in any peace negotiations.",
      "The Europeans are desperate to exert some influence over the meeting from which they have been sidelined. It remains unclear whether even Ukraine will take part. Trump has said that he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "But Trump has disappointed U.S. allies in Europe by saying that Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said that Russia must accept land swaps, although it remains unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.",
      "The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia\u2019s energy might to try to cow the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.",
      "The overarching fear for European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "In a statement early on Tuesday, the leaders said that they \u201cwelcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\u201d But, they underlined, \u201cthe path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cA just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force,\u201d they said.",

      "Military analysts using open source information to monitor the battles say the next 24-48 hours could be critical. Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important battlefield victory ahead of the summit. It would also complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of its military efforts.",
      "\u201cA lot will depend on availability, quantity and quality of Ukrainian reserves,\u201d Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, wrote in a post on X late Monday.",
      "Ukraine's military said its forces are fending off Russian infantry units trying to infiltrate their defensive positions in the Donetsk region. The region's Ukrainian military command posted on Facebook Monday that enemy soldiers penetrating Ukrainian lines to capture more territory \"face inevitable death\u201d but acknowledges that the situation remains \u201cdifficult, unpleasant and dynamic.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump repeated that \u201cthere\u2019ll be some land swapping going on.\u201d He said that this would involve \u201csome bad stuff for both\u201d Ukraine and Russia. His seemingly public rehabilitation of Putin \u2014 a pariah in most of Europe \u2014 has unnerved Ukraine\u2019s backers.",
      "Trump was also critical of Zelenskyy, noting that Ukraine\u2019s leader had been in power for the duration of the war and said \u201cnothing happened\u201d during that time. He contrasted that with Putin, who has wielded power unchallenged in Russia for decades.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the Europeans were unsettled by Trump mistakenly saying twice he would be traveling to Russia on Friday to meet Putin. The summit is taking place in the U.S. state of Alaska, which was colonized by Russia in the 18th century until Czar Alexander II sold it to the U.S. in a land deal in 1867.",
      "The Europeans will make a fresh attempt to rally Trump to Ukraine\u2019s cause on Wednesday at virtual meetings convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Trump did not confirm whether he would take part, but he did say: \u201cI\u2019m going to get everybody\u2019s ideas\u201d before meeting with Putin.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s statement was also meant to be a demonstration of European unity. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who is Putin\u2019s closest ally in Europe and has tried to block EU support for Ukraine, did not endorse it. He was the only one of the bloc's 27 leaders who refused to do so.",

      "HONG KONG -- The severely indebted real estate developer China Evergrande, already in the process of liquidation, said on Tuesday it will be delisted from Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange on Aug. 25, another setback to mainland China\u2019s property sector.",
      "Evergrande was the world\u2019s most heavily indebted real estate developer, with over $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders, when the court handed down a liquidation order in January 2024. The court had ruled that the company had failed to provide a viable restructuring plan for its debts, which fueled fears about China\u2019s rising debt burden, and trading of its shares has been halted since the ruling.",
      "The city's rules stipulate that the listing of companies may be canceled if trading in their securities has remained suspended for 18 months consecutively.",
      "China Evergrande Group received a letter Aug. 8 from the city's stock exchange notifying the firm of its decision to cancel the listing as trading had not resumed by Jul. 28. The last day of the listing will be Aug. 22 and Evergrande will not apply for a review of the decision, the company said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAll shareholders, investors and potential investors of the company should note that after the last listing date, whilst the share certificates of the shares will remain valid, the shares will not be listed on, and will not be tradeable on the Stock Exchange,\" the statement said.",
      "Evergrande is among scores of developers that defaulted on debts after Chinese regulators cracked down on excessive borrowing in the property industry in 2020. Unable to obtain financing, their vast obligations to creditors and customers became unsustainable.",
      "The crackdown also tipped the property industry into crisis, dragging down the world\u2019s second-largest economy and rattling financial systems in and outside China. Once among the nation's strongest growth engines, the industry is struggling to exit a prolonged downturn. Home prices in China have continued to fall even after the introduction of supportive measures by policymakers.",

They said an estimate of the amounts that may ultimately be realized from these entities wasn't available yet.",
      "About $255 million worth of assets have been sold, the liquidators said, calling the realization \u201cmodest.\" Of this amount, $244 million was derived from subsidiaries\u2019 assets, and not all of them will be available to the company, given the complex ownership structures of the assets.",

      "While Yoon\u2019s self-inflicted downfall extended a decades-long run of South Korean presidencies ending badly, he and Kim are the first former presidential couple to be jailed simultaneously over criminal allegations.",
      "Yoon\u2019s surprising yet poorly planned power grab on Dec. 3 came amid a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, who he described as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to block his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon\u2019s actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.",

She is being held at a detention center in southern Seoul, separate from the facility holding Yoon. She is expected to face further questioning on Thursday by investigators, who can extend her detention for up to 20 days before formally filing charges.",

Investigators suspect that the necklace was possibly linked to the chairman\u2019s son-in-law\u2019s hiring as the chief of staff of then-Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, Yoon\u2019s No. 2, shortly before the presidential trip. Kim has reportedly denied the accusations, claiming that the necklace she wore in Europe was not an authentic piece but a borrowed fake.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has seen a record increase in tariff income, with a 273% rise in customs revenue from last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. saw a 273% increase \u2014 or $21 billion \u2014 in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government\u2019s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.",
      "Even as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.",
      "If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.",
      "While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue \u2014 estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump\u2019s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result \u201c in only modest reductions in federal debt.\u201d",
      "In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.

      "They have accused the brand and Chavarria of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d and of copying the design without the permission of the Indigenous community. Authorities were quick to note that cultural Mexican designs have long been copied by major brands before, and said they planned to tighten laws to protect Mexican designs.",
      "Chavarria responded to mounting criticisms in comments sent to The Associated Press on Tuesday. In a statement addressed to the \u201cpeople of Oaxaca,\u201d he said that the design was intended to \u201cto honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities \u2014 a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,\u201d Chavarria wrote. \u201cThis falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.\u201d",

      "Their Aug. 25 summit will follow a July trade deal in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15% from the initially proposed 25% and to apply the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country\u2019s top export to the United States.",
      "South Korea also agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and invest $350 billion in the country, and Lee and Trump may discuss how the investment package will be structured and managed. The talks are expected to cover expanding cooperation in key industries such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding, Lee\u2019s spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said.",
      "Lee, a liberal who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has made the economy his top priority, aiming to shield the trade-dependent nation from the shocks of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and his demands that allies cut reliance on Washington and shoulder more of their own defense costs.",
      "Lee's meeting with Trump comes amid concerns in Seoul that the Trump administration could shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and possibly move to reduce it as Washington shifts more focus on China.",
      "Lee and Trump will discuss strengthening the allies\u2019 defense posture against growing North Korean threats, and also developing the partnership into a \u201cfuture-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance\u201d to address the changing international security and economic environment, according to Kang, who didn\u2019t elaborate on the specific issues to be addressed.",
      "Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil.

Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to \u201cmodernize\u201d the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d",

      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\u201cBalelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani\u2019s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \u201cJapan's Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2013 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",

      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",

      "Under MAS, Bolivia enjoyed years of a fixed exchange rate, low inflation and subsidized energy. Now, high inflation, a scarcity of imported goods and fuel shortages have beset the country.",

      "\u201cThe right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,\u201d he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners \u2014 businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga \u2014 built their careers.",
      "\u201cBut the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,\u201d Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom.",
      "The main issues in this hotly contested election are Bolivia's long-standing leftist economic model, its democratic integrity and the livelihoods of millions of people undergoing the country's worst financial crisis in four decades.",
      "\u201cThis seems the end of the cycle not only for MAS, but for an entire model of government,\u201d Bolivia political analyst Ver\u00f3nica Rocha said.",
      "Tensions within MAS can be traced to Morales' disputed 2019 reelection. Protests erupted and the leftist leader resigned under pressure from the military. He fled into exile and right-wing Senator Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez took office in what many view as a coup.",
      "Violent clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 37 people.",
      "Morales returned to Bolivia following the 2020 election victory of his former finance minister, Arce.",
      "But their competing ambitions collided when Morales announced his intention to return to politics. Lawmakers loyal to Morales deprived Arce\u2019s government of its majority. Judges answering to Arce ordered Morales\u2019 arrest over his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and barred his 2025 presidential candidacy on account of his past terms.",
      "\u201cMAS torpedoed its own chances of winning this election,\u201d said Gustavo Flores-Mac\u00edas, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.",
      "A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia\u2019s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term.",
      "Ever since, Quiroga has yearned for a term of his own. He ran three times \u2014 twice against Morales in 2005 and 2014. Now 65, he\u2019s hoping the fourth time\u2019s the charm.",

      "Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business",
      "NEW YORK -- Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business.",
      "Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to sustain operations. In a quarterly report issued on Monday, Spirit pointed to \u201cadverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",
      "That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year \u2014 among other challenges and \u201cuncertainties in its business operations\u201d that the Florida-based company expects to continue \u201cfor at least the remainder of 2025.\u201d",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its looming debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",

They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts taken before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit on Monday stressed that it needs more liquidity. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",

      "After years of being told that red wine was good for heart health, more Americans appear to be heeding warnings that even moderate alcohol consumption can be unhealthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a new Gallup poll released Wednesday.",
      "A record high percentage of U.S. adults, 53%, now say moderate drinking is bad for their health, up from 28% in 2015. The uptick in doubt about alcohol\u2019s benefits is largely driven by young adults \u2014 the age group that is most likely to believe drinking \u201cone or two drinks a day\u201d can cause health hazards \u2014 but older adults are also now increasingly likely to think moderate drinking carries risks.",
      "As concerns about health impacts rise, fewer Americans are reporting that they drink. The survey finds that 54% of U.S. adults say they drink alcoholic beverages such as liquor, wine or beer. That\u2019s lower than at any other point in the past three decades.",
      "The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless \u2014 or even beneficial \u2014 worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. According to Gallup\u2019s data, even those who consume alcohol are drinking less.",
      "The federal government is updating new dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, government data showed U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up. But other government surveys have shown a decline in certain types of drinking, particularly among teenagers and young adults.",
      "This comes alongside a new drumbeat of information about alcohol\u2019s risks. While moderate drinking was once thought to have benefits for heart health, health professionals in recent years have pointed to overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer.",
      "Younger adults have been quicker than older Americans to accept that drinking is harmful, but older adults are coming around to the same view.",
      "About two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-olds believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, according to the new poll, up from about 4 in 10 in 2015. Older adults are less likely to see alcohol as harmful \u2014 about half of Americans age 55 or older believe this \u2014 but that\u2019s a substantial increase, too. In 2015, only about 2 in 10 adults age 55 or older thought alcohol was bad for their health.",
      "In the past, moderate drinking was thought to have some benefits. That idea came from imperfect studies that largely didn\u2019t include younger people and couldn\u2019t prove cause and effect. Now the scientific consensus has shifted, and several countries recently lowered their alcohol consumption recommendations. Earlier this year, the outgoing U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recommended a label on bottles of beer, wine and liquor that would clearly outline the link between alcohol consumption and cancer.",
      "The federal government\u2019s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer.",
      "Gallup\u2019s director of U.S. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans\u2019 lives may be a reason why they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful.",
      "\u201cOlder folks may be a little more hardened in terms of the whiplash that they get with recommendations,\u201d Saad said. \u201cIt may take them a little longer to absorb or accept the information. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they\u2019ve grown up in ... in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.\u201d",

In sharp contrast with Gallup\u2019s findings two decades ago, when young adults were likeliest to report drinking, young adults' drinking rate is now slightly below middle-aged and older adults.",
      "Americans\u2019 reported drinking is among the lowest since the question was first asked in 1939. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question\u2019s history.",
      "Even if concerns about health risks aren\u2019t causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink.",
      "The survey found that adults who think moderate drinking is bad for one\u2019s health are just as likely as people who don't share those concerns to report that they drink, but fewer of the people with health worries had consumed alcohol recently.",
      "About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.",

      "During negotiations with the Trump administration, Vietnam's focus was on its tariffs compared to those of its neighbors and competitors, said Daniel Kritenbrink, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re in the same zone, in the same ballpark, I think Vietnam can live with that outcome,\" he said.

      "They were able to free one injured worker who was whisked to a hospital. But one more was still missing, and the area was too unstable to continue working, according to Matthew Brown, chief of Allegheny County Emergency Services.",
      "A Pittsburgh-based crew from Pennsylvania Urban Search & Rescue was called in to help, some of whose members were already responding through their affiliations with local fire departments, Brown said. The team stabilized a wall at the plant and used an advanced camera to detect the missing employee. They pulled away the rubble and were able to extract the body of the worker, who died.",
      "Monday's explosion, which was powerful enough to shake nearby homes, killed two workers and injured more than 10 others. Five people ranging in age from 27 to 74 remained hospitalized Tuesday including the rescued worker, who was in critical but stable condition, according to the Allegheny County Police Department. Three were at UPMC Mercy, the region\u2019s only level-one trauma and burn center.",

      "An independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs says VA hospitals have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- Government-run medical centers serving the nation's veterans have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages, with many hospitals having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, according to an independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "Tuesday's report from the VA's Office of Inspector General is based on surveys from late March and early April that were taken at 139 Veterans Health Administration facilities. Severe staffing shortages are not necessarily an indication of vacancies but refer to particular occupations that are difficult to fill.",
      "The surveys were taken just weeks after it was reported in early March that the VA had planned to cut 80,000 jobs \u2014 out of 484,000 \u2014 through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The VA later reduced the figure to nearly 30,000 jobs to be cut by this fiscal year\u2019s end on Sept. 30.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration said Tuesday that the surveys are unreliable because they do not reflect actual vacancies, which VA officials said were in line with historical averages. But Democratic lawmakers warned that veterans won't get the health care they need as VA positions become harder to fill.",
      "The surveys reflected a 50% increase in the reporting of severe staffing shortages for specific jobs, both for clinical occupations that include doctors and psychologists and for non-clinical jobs that include police and custodial workers.",
      "Nearly all of the facilities \u2014 94% \u2014 reported a shortage for medical officer occupations that include doctors, while 79% reported shortages for nurses. The report noted that severe shortages for medical officers and nurses have been identified every year in the report since 2014.",
      "Pete Kasperowicz, the VA's press secretary, stressed in an email that the report is not based on vacancies and is therefore \u201cnot a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,\u201d Kasperowicz wrote.",
      "He said that vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively, which he said are lower than most other health care systems and in line with \u201cnormal VA historical averages.\u201d",

      "But Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the surveys reflect the Trump administration's profound hostility toward the federal workforce and what she said are its plans to ultimately privatize the VA.",
      "\u201cThis is a deliberate effort to incapacitate and to undermine veterans' support for and approval of the care they receive in VA hospitals and clinics,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to wait much longer for appointments. There won\u2019t be specialists available. They\u2019ll have no choice but to go to the private sector.\u201d",
      "Simon also noted the VA\u2019s announcement last week that it was terminating collective bargaining agreements for most VA bargaining-unit employees, which could further hurt recruitment.",
      "The VA said in a news release that the move will \u201cmake it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America\u2019s Veterans.\u201d",
      "But U.S. Sen. Mark Warner said in a news release Tuesday that the Trump administration has made it harder for public servants to do their jobs \u201cand ultimately harder for veterans to get the care they\u2019ve earned.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also know from recent jobs reports that applications to work at the VA are plummeting,\" said Warner, a Democrat who represents the veteran-dense state of Virginia. \u201cHow do skyrocketing staffing shortages and declining applicant pools make it more \u2018efficient\u2019 for veterans to access the care and services they deserve? The answer is: they don\u2019t.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build, and will outcompete rival models.",
      "The automaker\u2019s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford\u2019s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cIn our careers, as automobile people we\u2019re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,\u201d CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. \u201cAnd I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.\u201d",
      "The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.",
      "The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.",
      "The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.",
      "The automaker sees this as a \u201cModel T moment\u201d for its EV business \u2014 a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model-T,\u201d Farley said.",
      "The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.",
      "The Louisville factory \u2014 one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky\u2019s largest city \u2014 will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it\u2019s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.",
      "The result will be \u201can affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,\u201d Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. \u201cThis is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.\u201d",

      "The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an \u201cassembly tree\u201d at the Louisville plant, it said. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.",
      "Other specifications for the midsize electric truck \u2013 including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times \u2014 will be announced later, the company said. Ford revealed in its release that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.",
      "Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker\u2019s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.",
      "\u201cThis announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky\u2019s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford\u2019s future,\u201d Beshear said.",
      "Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.",
      "Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford\u2019s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.",

      "Saving for the future can be difficult because of a cognitive bias known as hyperbolic discounting: our tendency to place greater weight on immediate satisfaction, even if focusing on the long term will have a greater payoff. This bias is why, when you get a raise, you may consider getting a new car\u2014incurring a higher monthly payment\u2014instead of sacking away more money each month for retirement and perhaps getting to retire several years earlier.",
      "Feeling stressed about finances can also get you off track with your savings. While some people respond to financial stress by saving more, others respond by spending more in order to regain feelings of control.",
      "Unfortunately, these shortsighted decisions on spending versus saving can have large effects on our ability to achieve our future goals, because of the enormous power of compound interest. So, let\u2019s talk about what you can do to keep saving when you feel the urge to give up.",
      "Sit down and list what you are saving for. If needed, you can use techniques geared toward helping people find and articulate their financial goals.",
      "Then, consider how you might pair up your goals to boost your savings motivation. Research suggests the most motivating financial goals may be those relating to security (for example, retirement) or self-actualization (such as opening a business or contributing to charities). Consider how you may link some of your shorter-term goals to these bigger goals.",
      "For instance, you may decide to couple your \u201csavings for home repairs\u201d with your desire to \u201cdonate to charity\u201d by committing to donate the excess you saved for repairs to your favorite nonprofit. By ensuring your goals are well-articulated and meaningful, you can always come back to them for a dose of motivation when you feel yourself wavering.",
      "When we are feeling stressed by finances, we may convince ourselves that all our current spending is more of a priority than our saving. So, start by doing a comprehensive review of your budget.",
      "How much money comes in each month, how much goes out, and where does it go? If you don\u2019t find a monthly surplus, that indicates you may need to go through your spending and decide where you can spend less.",

      "Remember, it\u2019s OK if you cannot save as much in this season of your life as you\u2019d like. But by saving what you can and coming back to this practice when your circumstances change, you can still make serious progress toward your goals.",
      "Now, make your commitment as easy as possible by automating the process. If you have to decide every month to transfer money into your IRA or savings, the chances are that it won\u2019t happen at some point. You\u2019ll forget, put it off, or maybe decide that this is the month for a treat instead.",
      "Research suggests that automating savings can help people save more than they otherwise would, so taking the time to automate your savings now can help you stick with your plan for months\u2014or years\u2014to come.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended.",
      "After the most recent round of China-U.S. trade talks, held late last month in Stockholm, Chinese and U.S. officials said they expected the deadline to be extended for another 90 days. The U.S. side said the decision was up to President Donald Trump. So far there has been no formal announcement about whether he will endorse an extension or push ahead with the higher tariffs.",
      "The uncertainty has left businesses in limbo and a decision to raise the import duties could jolt world markets.",
      "Trump has repeatedly shifted deadlines and tariff rates, and neither side has indicated what it plans for Tuesday. Extending the Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl.",
      "Higher tariffs are aimed at offsetting the huge, chronic U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a 21-year low in July as the threat of tariffs bit into Chinese exports.",
      "It's not unusual for the U.S. to give hints on where talks stand, but it's rare for China to make announcements until major decisions are set. So far, Beijing's refrained from commenting ahead of Tuesday's deadline.",
      "In an interview with Fox News taped on Thursday but aired on Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Trump was considering additional tariffs on Beijing because of China's purchases of Russian oil. But he said Trump \u201chasn't made any firm decisions.\u201d",
      "Prohibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market.

U.S. exports to China are subject to tariffs of around 30%. Before the two sides called a truce, Trump had threatened to impose 245% import duties on Chinese goods.

      "Paramount and UFC have announced a billion-dollar rights deal, marking a significant shift for the fight company",
      "Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company\u2019s new streaming home.",
      "That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.",
      "Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely going to happen,\" White told The Associated Press. \u201cThink about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.\u201d",
      "The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion.",
      "White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet \u2014 a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS.",
      "ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights \u2014 White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms \u2014 but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window.",
      "The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,\u201d White said. \u201cThey're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.\u201d",
      "The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC\u2019s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans \u2014 with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees.",
      "Paramount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. \u201cas they become available in the future.\u201d",
      "UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night.",
      "\u201cThis is a 1-of-1 event,\u201d White said.",
      "There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d \u201cRoad To UFC,\u201d and \u201cDana White\u2019s Contender Series.\u201d It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.",

      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured that out yet but we will,\u201d White said.",
      "And what about the sometimes-contentious issue of fighter pay? Some established fighters have clauses in their contracts that they earn more money the higher the buyrate on their cards. Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal \u2014 with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way.",
      "\u201cIt will affect fighter pay, big time,\u201d White said. \u201cFrom deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.\u201d",
      "Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model \u2014 which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events \u2014 should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth.",
      "\u201cEvery fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is...no more PPV excuses,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cGet your worth boys and girls.\u201d",
      "White also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead.",
      "There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. White, though, is part of the promotional team for the Canelo \u00c1lvarez and Terence Crawford fight in September in Las Vegas that airs on Netflix.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not run it\u2019s course,\u201d White said. \u201cThere were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren\u2019t. Wherever we ended up, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to roll with.\u201d",
      "White said UFC archival footage \u201ckills it\u201d in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.",
      "Just when it seems there's little left for UFC to conquer, White says, there's always more. Why stop at becoming the biggest fight game in the world? Why not rewrite the pecking order in popularity and riches and go for No. 1 in all sports?",
      "\u201cYou have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming. We\u2019re coming for all of them.\u201d",

      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Shohei Ohtani's latest home run binge hasn't been enough to spark the Los Angeles Dodgers out of a summer malaise that's endangering their customary perch atop the NL West.",
      "Ohtani homered in his third straight game Monday night, hitting his 42nd of the season in the eighth inning of the Dodgers' 7-4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels.",
      "The Dodgers trailed 7-0 when Ohtani connected off Shaun Anderson with one out, driving his fourth homer in five games into the right field bleachers to tie Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber for the NL lead. Seattle's Cal Raleigh leads the majors with 45 homers.",
      "Ohtani also started a rally: Mookie Betts and Will Smith then singled before Max Muncy brought them home with his 17th homer, trimming the Dodgers' deficit to three runs and inspiring thunderous roars from the Dodgers fans comprising more than half of the Angel Stadium crowd.",
      "But the Dodgers got no closer, with Connor Brogdon and longtime Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen calmly wrapping up the sub-.500 Angels' fifth consecutive win over their crosstown rivals.",
      "The loss shrunk the Dodgers' lead over San Diego in the NL West to just one game \u2014 the smallest cushion since June 14.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a really bad loss for us,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really any way of getting around that.\u201d",
      "Ohtani has a 10-game hitting streak in August, his longest of the season, and he has four homers among his nine hits in the Dodgers\u2019 last five games. The two-way superstar is the presumptive front-runner for his fourth MVP award.",
      "Despite his heroics, the Dodgers are 10-12 since the All-Star break.",
      "With meager production across their lineup and inconsistent relief pitching just when their problematic rotation finally started to click, they've only rarely looked like the juggernaut franchise that has won two of the past five World Series, four of the last eight NL pennants and 11 of the last 12 division crowns.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going well for us right now,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to snap out of it. No one is going to feel sorry for us. It\u2019s on us to find our way out of it, and we will.\u201d",
      "A day after the Dodgers' bullpen blew an eighth-inning lead in a 5-4 loss to Toronto, top starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto got raked by the Angels' largely average lineup for six runs on six hits and five walks, creating a hole the Dodgers couldn't escape. The Dodgers began the weekend with two solid performances against the AL-leading Blue Jays, only to fall back into another rut.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for some traction here, and trying to stack some wins,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cHate to say that yesterday\u2019s loss carried over to tonight. ... You win yesterday, and you feel even better about coming into today, but now you look at losing two games in a row. It\u2019s baseball, and we\u2019re good at resetting, coming back.\u201d",

      "Since the LCS expanded to best-of-seven in 1985, both leagues ended in four or five games in 1989, 2001, 2002, 2014 and 2022. Last year was the first in which MLB announced a flexible schedule.",
      "Game 7 of this year's World Series would be on Nov. 1. The World Series ended in November in 2001, \u201809, \u201910, \u201815, \u201916, \u201817, \u201921 and \u201822 and \u201923, going as late as Nov. 5 in 2022.",
      "The World Series is scheduled to start on a Friday for the fifth straight year. Before 2022, the Series had not started on a Friday since 1915.",
      "NL Division Series will have an extra scheduled off day between Games 1 and 2, a format that allows a team to have the same pitchers start Games 1 and 4, and Games 2 and 5 on normal four days\u2019 rest. Last year, AL Division Series had the extra off day.",
      "All four best-of-three Wild Card Series are scheduled for consecutive days from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 at the side of the higher seed.",
      "Twelve teams make the playoffs under the format that began in 2022. The top two teams in each league get first-round byes, while the No. 3 seed faces No. 6 and No. 4 plays No. 5. The higher seed will be home in each best-of-three series.",

      "The league will request a rehearing from the same court that overturned a prior Nevada Supreme Court panel ruling in May 2024 that the matter could go to arbitration. But in October, Gruden was granted a hearing by the full court.",
      "Gruden filed a lawsuit in 2021 against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell, alleging a \u201cmalicious and orchestrated campaign\u201d to destroy his career by leaking old emails he sent that included racist, misogynistic and homophobic comments that pressured the Raiders to fire him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to having the truth come out and I want to make sure what happened to me doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else,\u201d Gruden said in a statement to ESPN.",
      "Gruden resigned from the Raiders in October 2021 and sued the league a month later.",
      "In 2022, the NFL appealed to Nevada\u2019s high court after a judge in Las Vegas rejected league bids to dismiss Gruden\u2019s claim outright or to order out-of-court talks through an arbitration process that could be overseen by Goodell.",
      "The Nevada Supreme Court, in a 5-2 ruling, said that \u201cthe arbitration clause in the NFL Constitution is unconscionable and does not apply to Gruden as a former employee.\u201d",

      "South Africa also shrugged off the dew at the venue and held onto some brilliant catches with Nqabayomzi Peter, one of the two changes the visitors made from the first game, holding onto a spectacular low catch at mid-wicket to dismiss Green in Maphaka\u2019s first over.",
      "In sharp contrast, Australia was scrappy in the field.",
      "Substitute fielder Matthew Kuhnemann dropped Brevis soon after the power-hitter had completed his half century off 25 balls. The ball burst through his hands on the long-on boundary, much to the disappointment of bowler Maxwell.",

      "\u201cWe would be the first (Spanish) team to play a league match abroad,\u201d Villarreal president Fernando Roig told a news conference. \"It would greatly help us expand our brand in a key market like the United States.\u201d",

      "It wasn't clear whether it would be Villarreal or the league paying for the travel and tickets for the club's fans this time.",

      "Some fan groups in Spain and the country's players association on Monday expressed their disapproval of the plan to move the match thousands of kilometers away.",
      "It has become routine, though, for U.S. pro sports leagues to stage games in Europe, Asia and South America that help build their brands and fan bases.",

      "The threatened species, which makes its habitat in warmer southern Gulf waters in places like Florida, was first seen July 26 off the southwestern coast of Cape Cod in the area of Nantucket Sound. Mashpee resident Jennifer Sullivan took a video of it swimming alongside paddle boarders in an inlet behind a marina surrounded by sea grass.",

      "\u201cIt was completely unfazed by us,\" said Sullivan, who went on to say she felt \u201cjust in awe of how graceful the creature was and to be so close in the wild to it.\u201d",
      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",

      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "Farmers in Kenya face challenges with elephants raiding crops and sometimes causing harm",
      "TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people.",
      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",

      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",

      "The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world.

      "Scientists from a university are filtering Mexico City's waters for traces of the DNA of an endangered salamander, the axolotl",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls \u2014 the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon \u2014 out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it\u2019s almost impossible to find them in the wild.",

      "\u201cWe all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,\u201d said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab.",
      "As they try to monitor the axolotls\u2019 dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.",
      "They sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That\u2019s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.",

      "More than 70 million Americans have experienced the muggiest start to summer on record, with climate change increasing humidity in the Eastern U.S. An Associated Press analysis shows that parts of 20 states and Washington, D",
      "More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows.",
      "And that meant uncomfortably warm and potentially dangerous nights in many cities the last several weeks, the National Weather Service said.",
      "Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable \u2014 with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher \u2014 in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service.",
      "And that's just the daily average. In much of the East, the mugginess kept rising to near tropical levels for a few humid hours. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data.",
      "Dew point is a measure of moisture in the air expressed in degrees that many meteorologists call the most accurate way to describe humidity. The summer of 2025 so far has had dew points that average at least 6 degrees higher than the 1951-2020 normals in Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Columbus and St. Louis, the AP calculations show. The average June and July humidity for the entire country east of the Rockies rose to more than 66 degrees, higher than any year since measurements started in 1950.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very muggy summer. The humid heat has been way up,\u201d said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "Twice this summer climate scientist and humidity expert Cameron Lee of Kent State University measured dew points of about 82 degrees at his home weather station in Ohio. That's off the various charts that the weather service uses to describe what dew points feel like.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the United States that are experiencing not only greater average humidity, especially in the spring and summer, but also more extreme humid days,\u201d Lee said. He said super sticky days are now stretching out over more days and more land.",
      "High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Virginia Beach, Va., and Wilmington, N.C., all reached records for the hottest overnight lows. New York City, Columbus, Atlanta, Richmond, Knoxville, Tennessee and Concord, New Hampshire came close, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat really impacts the body is that nighttime temperature,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s no cooling at night or if there\u2019s a lack of cooling it doesn\u2019t allow your body to cool off and recover from what was probably a really hot afternoon. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don\u2019t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.\u201d",
      "An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said.",
      "The area east of the Rockies has on average gained about 2.5 degrees in summer dew point since 1950, the AP analysis of Copernicus data shows. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. In four of the last six years that number has been near and even over the uncomfortable line of 65.",

What was mostly missing was the occasional cool front that pushes out the most oppressive heat and humidity. That finally came in August and brought relief, he said.",
      "Humidity varies by region. The West is much drier. The South gets more 65-degree dew points in the summer than the North. But that's changing.",

      "President Donald Trump's plan for 100% tariffs on non-U.S. computer chips is causing confusion among businesses and trading partners",
      "President Donald Trump's plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners \u2014 boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications.",
      "The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device \u2014 from an iPhone to a car \u2014 were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country.",
      "\"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that companies that \"made a commitment to build\" in the U.S. would be spared the import tax, even if they are not yet producing those chips in American factories.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u201cBut if you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge.\u201d",
      "Wall Street investors interpreted that as good news not just for U.S. companies like AMD, Intel and Nvidia, but also for the biggest Asian chipmakers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that have been working to build U.S. factories.",
      "But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the AI boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines.",

      "The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There\u2019s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that\u2019s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.",
      "Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.",

      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",

      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",

      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,\" she said. \u201cBut sacrificing science is problematic, and it\u2019s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.\u201d",

Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",

      "Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech\u2019s energy-hungry data centers",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.",
      "It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.",
      "But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.",
      "That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.",
      "Rising power bills are \u201csomething legislators have been hearing a lot about. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive outcry.\u201d",
      "Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.",
      "\u201cA lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,\u201d said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. \u201cI think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.\u201d",
      "A fix, Peskoe said, is a \u201ccan of worms\" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.",
      "Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.",
      "Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.",
      "The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.",
      "But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren\u2019t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.",
      "In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes \u2014 residential, commercial and industrial \u2014 are likely paying for data center power needs.",
      "Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% \u2014 or $9.3 billion \u2014 of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.",
      "Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers \u201cpaying billions more than is necessary.\u201d",

      "Roblox, the online gaming platform wildly popular with children and teenagers, is rolling out an open-source version of an artificial intelligence system it says can help preemptively detect predatory language in game chats.",
      "The move comes as the company faces lawsuits and criticism accusing it of not doing enough to protect children from predators. For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it \u201ceasy prey for pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that \u201cno system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.\u201d",
      "The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. The company is now in the process of open-sourcing it so other platforms can use it too.",
      "Preemptively detecting possible dangers to kids can be tricky for AI systems \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 because conversations can seem innocuous at first. Questions like \u201chow old are you?\u201d or \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d wouldn't necessarily raise red flags on their own, but when put in context over the course of a longer conversation, they can take on a different meaning.",
      "Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though \u2014 as with most moderation rules \u2014 people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards.",
      "It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",

And that\u2019s really good for doing things like blocking profanity and blocking different types of abusive language and things like that,\u201d said Matt Kaufman, chief safety officer at Roblox. \"But when you\u2019re thinking about things related to child endangerment or grooming, the types of behaviors you\u2019re looking at manifest over a very long period of time.\u201d",
      "Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox \u2014 about 6 billion messages per day \u2014 and analyzes them for potential harms. To do this, Roblox says it developed two indexes \u2014 one made up of benign messages and, the other, chats that were determined to contain child endangerment violations. Roblox says this lets the system recognize harmful patterns that go beyond simply flagging certain words or phrases, taking the entire conversation into context.",
      "\u201cThat index gets better as we detect more bad actors, we just continuously update that index. Then we have another sample of what does a normal, regular user do?\" said Naren Koneru, vice president of engineering for trust and safety at Roblox.",
      "As users are chatting, the system keeps score \u2014 are they closer to the positive cluster or the negative cluster?",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen on one message because you just send one message, but it happens because of all of your days' interactions are leading towards one of these two,\u201d Koneru said. \u201cThen we say, okay, maybe this user is somebody who we need to take a much closer look at, and then we go pull all of their other conversations, other friends, and the games that they played, and all of those things.\u201d",

      "Mountain resorts near Sarajevo are shifting from snow sports to summer tourism",
      "SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A short drive from the Mediterranean coast, mid-altitude mountain resorts near Sarajevo \u2014 traditionally dependent on snow sports \u2014 are slowly but steadily pivoting to attract summertime tourists.",
      "Despite Bosnia\u2019s notoriously poor record-keeping, tourism officials in the mountainous Balkan country of 3.3 million say a clear trend is emerging.",
      "\u201cWe used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,\u201d said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president.",
      "Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. He said increasing the area's year-round appeal is \u201cthe future of tourism,\u201d but acknowledged it\u2019s a long-term strategy.",
      "In 2017, after several winters with little snow, the Jahorina and Bjelasnica mountains near Sarajevo began to expand their summer offerings. These mountains, which hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, have elevations of 1,906 meters (6,253 feet) and 2,067 meters (6,781 feet), respectively.",
      "They now operate ski lifts year-round for scenic views and are steadily adding new hiking, biking and ATV trails and tours.",
      "\u201cThe weather here is fantastic \u2014 it's not hot at all,\" said Dusko Kurtovic, a visitor from the Bosnian town of Doboj, while on a walk during a short vacation in Jahorina last week.",
      "Like other visitors exploring the forest trails and riding ski lifts around Sarajevo, Kurtovic was dressed for balmy summer weather. Temperatures here typically stay between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius (75-86 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years.",

      "Business might be growing in the mountains of Sarajevo, but it remains far less profitable than seaside destinations in neighboring Croatia, where tourism accounts for up to 20% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.",
      "Just a five-hour drive from Sarajevo, the ancient city of Dubrovnik is grappling with an abundance of tourists. Unlike their Bosnian counterparts who are trying to increase visitors, Dubrovnik\u2019s tourism authorities are focused on managing crowds, limiting the number of tourists from cruise ships in the city to 4,000 at any one time during the day and restricting traffic around the Old Town to local permit holders.",
      "Despite these restrictions and extreme summer heat, Dubrovnik recorded nearly two million overnight stays in the first seven months of 2025, almost double that of the Sarajevo region.",
      "While climate change is driving Bosnia and Croatia toward different tourism strategies, both countries share a common objective: to \u201cextend the season\u201d and become a \u201cyear-round tourist destination,\u201d in the words of Aida Hodzic of the Dubrovnik tourism board.",

      "U.S. lawmakers are urging the Trump administration to maintain a security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom to supply nuclear-powered submarines",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. lawmakers from both parties are urging the Trump administration to maintain a three-way security partnership designed to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines \u2014 a plea that comes as the Pentagon reviews the agreement and considers the questions it has raised about the American industrial infrastructure's shipbuilding capabilities.",
      "Two weeks ago, the Defense Department announced it would review AUKUS, the 4-year-old pact signed by the Biden administration with Australia and the United Kingdom. The announcement means the Republican administration is looking closely at a partnership that many believe is critical to the U.S. strategy to push back China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. The review is expected to be completed in the fall.",
      "\u201cAUKUS is essential to strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and advancing the undersea capabilities that will be central to ensuring peace and stability,\" Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan and Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote in a July 22 letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Moolenaar chairs the House panel on China and Krishnamoorthi is its top Democrat.",
      "The review comes as the Trump administration works to rebalance its global security concerns while struggling with a hollowed-out industrial base that has hamstrung U.S. capabilities to build enough warships. The review is being led by Elbridge Colby, the No. 3 Pentagon official, who has expressed skepticism about the partnership.",
      "\u201cIf we can produce the attack submarines in sufficient number and sufficient speed, then great. But if we can\u2019t, that becomes a very difficult problem,\" Colby said during his confirmation hearing in March. \u201cThis is getting back to restoring our defense industrial capacity so that we don\u2019t have to face these awful choices but rather can be in a position where we can produce not only for ourselves, but for our allies.\"",
      "As part of the $269 billion AUKUS partnership, the United States will sell three to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, with the first delivery scheduled as soon as 2032. The U.S. and the U.K. would help Australia design and build another three to five attack submarines to form an eight-boat force for Australia.",
      "A March report by the Congressional Research Service warned that the lack of U.S. shipbuilding capacities, including workforce shortage and insufficient supply chains, is jeopardizing the much-celebrated partnership. If the U.S. should sell the vessels to Australia, the U.S. Navy would have a shortage of attack submarines for two decades, the report said.",
      "The Navy has been ordering two boats per year in the last decade, but U.S. shipyards have been only producing 1.2 Virginia-class subs a year since 2022, the report said.",
      "\u201cThe delivery pace is not where it needs to be\" to make good on the first pillar of AUKUS, Admiral Daryl Caudle, nominee for the Chief of Naval Operations, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month.",
      "Australia has invested $1 billion in the U.S. submarine industrial base, with another $1 billion to be paid before the end of this year. It has agreed to contribute a total of $3 billion to uplift the U.S. submarine base, and it has sent both industry personnel to train at U.S. shipyards and naval personnel for submarine training in the United States.",
      "\"Australia was clear that we would make a proportionate contribution to the United States industrial base,\u201d an Australian defense spokesperson said in July. \u201cAustralia\u2019s contribution is about accelerating U.S. production rates and maintenance to enable the delivery of Australia\u2019s future Virginia-class submarines.\u201d",

      "Rudd expressed confidence that the two governments \u201cwill work our way through this stuff.\u201d",
      "Bruce Jones, senior fellow with the Strobe Talbott Center for Security, Strategy and Technology, told The Associated Press that the partnership, by positioning subs in Western Australia, is helping arm the undersea space that is \u201creally crucial to American deterrence and defense options in the Western Pacific.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe right answer is not to be content with the current pace of submarine building. It\u2019s to increase the pace,\" Jones said.",
      "Jennifer Parker, who has served more than 20 years with the Royal Australian Navy and founded Barrier Strategic Advisory, said it should not be a zero-sum game. \u201cYou might sell one submarine to Australia, so you have one less submarine on paper.

      "FIFA is testing a new protocol for the 2026 World Cup in North America, requiring host committees to develop human rights action plans",
      "ATLANTA -- Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America.",
      "With the games less than a year away, though, FIFA\u2019s commitment to upholding human rights is still under scrutiny. Human rights advocates who wanted more enforceable standards and clearer directions for local officials say FIFA watered down a more robust model for the plans.",
      "\u201cEven though where we landed is very different than what we had consulted them on, the existence of the framework is in many ways unprecedented. Sports bodies have not had human rights frameworks that reflected the breadth of issues covered across so many jurisdictions. But the plan is just a plan. It's not self-executing,\u201d said Jennifer Li, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights.",
      "Adding to advocates' unease, several U.S. host committees said they couldn\u2019t meet a March deadline for an early draft of their plans. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. 29 deadline. Sixteen North American sites will host games, including 11 in the U.S.",
      "Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. Migrant workers labored in Qatar\u2019s scorching heat for more than a decade before the 2022 World Cup there, and human rights advocates worry migrant workers\u2019 lives are again at risk in Saudi Arabia, which will host the games in 2034.",
      "FIFA\u2019s suggestions for the 2026 plans include guidelines on nondiscrimination, security, preventing trafficking, protecting unhoused people and workers\u2019 rights, including for migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThe host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they\u2019ve stepped up,\u201d said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA\u2019s human rights work for 2026.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, stirring fears that federal law enforcement officers will arrest workers and even travelers during the games. Trump imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June, and seven face restrictions.",
      "FIFA President Gianni Infantino has close ties to Trump. A FIFA spokesperson said it is working with a White House task force to \u201cbring millions of people from different nations and communities\u201d together in the U.S.",
      "Protesters in Miami-Dade County gathered outside FIFA\u2019s offices in June to demand that the governing body protect travelers and workers and speak out against Trump\u2019s immigration moves. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that you might not have ICE posted up at the World Cup,\" South Florida AFL-CIO President Jeff Mitchell said.",
      "Local organizers don't seem to have their human rights plan ready and haven't agreed to meet with the union, Mitchell said. He noted that the region has a history of wage theft in a state with weak heat protection laws for workers.",
      "\u201cOrganizations like FIFA like to say that they have these human rights efforts, but they aren\u2019t pushing it,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving it up to the locals to do it. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States Tuesday in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks smuggling drugs across the border.",
      "Those handed over to U.S. custody include Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, a leader of \u201cLos Cuinis,\u201d a group closely aligned with notorious cartel Jalisco New Generation or CJNG. Another defendant, Roberto Salazar, is wanted in connection to the 2008 killing of a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy. Other prominent figures have ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and other violent drug trafficking groups.",
      "The transfers are a milestone for the Trump administration, which is made dismantling dangerous drug cartels a key Justice Department priority. It\u2019s the second time in months that Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs onto American streets.",
      "\u201cThese 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores \u2014 under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful to Mexico\u2019s National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.\u201d",
      "The cartel figures were put on planes to the U.S. after the Justice Department agreed not to seek the death penalty against any of the defendants or against any cartel leaders and members sent to the U.S. in February. That transfer was of 29 cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985.",
      "\u201cThis transfer is yet another example of what is possible when two governments stand united against violence and impunity,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThese fugitives will now face justice in U.S. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.\u201d",
      "The February transfers came as Mexican officials were trying to head off the Trump administration\u2019s threat of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports. Late last month, President Donald Trump spoke with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and agreed to put off threatened 30% tariffs for another 90 days to allow for negotiations.",
      "Sheinbaum has shown a willingness to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico\u2019s cartels.

      "Also included in the group expelled Tuesday was Servando G\u00f3mez Martinez, also known as \u201cLa Tuta,\u201d a former school teacher who became one of Mexico\u2019s most-wanted drug lords as head of the Knights Templar cartel.

      "MIAMI -- A federal judge is set to hear closing arguments Wednesday over whether to stop construction indefinitely at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d as she considers whether it violates environmental laws.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered a two-week halt on new construction last Thursday as witnesses continued to testify in a hearing to determine whether construction should end until the ultimate resolution of the case.",
      "The temporary order doesn\u2019t include any restrictions on law enforcement or immigration enforcement activity at the center, which is currently holding hundreds of detainees. The center, which was quickly built two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport, is designed to eventually hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures.",
      "The order temporarily barred the installation of any new industrial-style lighting, as well as any paving, filling, excavating, fencing or erecting additional buildings, tents, dormitories or other residential or administrative facilities.",
      "Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe want Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction, which they say threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars\u2019 worth of environmental restoration.",
      "Plaintiffs presented witnesses Wednesday and Thursday who testified that the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects.",
      "Attorneys for the state and federal government have said that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the federal environmental review wouldn\u2019t apply.",
      "The judge last week said the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.",
      "Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers.",
      "Amy Castaneda, the Miccosukee Tribe's water resource director, testified Tuesday that nutrient runoff from the detention center could flow into tribal lands, changing vegetation growth. That could lead to fish kills and block humans and wildlife from moving throughout certain areas, she said.",
      "Marcel Bozas, director of the Miccosukee Tribe's fish and wildlife department, said tribe members hunt and fish for subsistence and cultural reasons. Sustained human activity can drive away game animals, like whitetail deer, as well as protected species, like Florida panthers, wood storks, eastern black rails and bonneted bats, he said.",

      "Attorneys for federal and state agencies last month asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida\u2019s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit because the detention center is in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state\u2019s middle district, they said.",
      "Williams had yet to rule on that argument.",
      "In a second legal challenge to \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\" a federal judge over the weekend gave the state more time to prepare arguments against an effort to get the civil rights litigation certified as a class action.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz in Miami said he will only consider a motion by detainees\u2019 lawyers for a preliminary injunction during an Aug. 18 hearing. He set a Sept. 23 deadline for the state to respond to the detainee\u2019s class action request. The second lawsuit claims detainees\u2019 constitutional rights are being violated because they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings.",
      "The lawsuits were being heard as DeSantis\u2032 administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida. At least one contract has been awarded for what is labeled in state records as the \u201cNorth Detention Facility.\u201d",

      "Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for Cubans fleeing communist rule at the height of the Cold War",
      "MIAMI -- For decades, its powerful lighthouse illuminated Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay, and during the height of the Cold War, what was known as the Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing communist rule.",
      "The 14-story Spanish Revival skyscraper was where, from 1962 to 1974, the U.S. State Department welcomed Cuban refugees with medical services, English classes, and comfort kits containing essentials and something wholly exotic to the new arrivals: peanut butter.",
      "After decades of neglect, what was once Miami\u2019s tallest building is getting a well-deserved facelift. Next month, it will reopen as a museum honoring the history of Cuban exiles with immersive, state-of-the-art exhibits that explore the meaning of migration, freedom and homeland.",
      "The reopening of what\u2019s dubbed the Ellis Island of the South comes at a sensitive moment. Cuban Americans \u2014 who dominate politics in Miami \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in the last presidential election. But the president\u2019s crackdown on migrants \u2014 including Cubans \u2014 is increasingly viewed as a betrayal and has left many second-guessing that support. Not surprisingly, recent protests against Trump have gathered outside the tower.",
      "The organizers of the museum, while tiptoeing around the present-day politics, are nonetheless unapologetic in their embrace of the American dream. In Miami, a thriving crossroads where 70% of residents speak Spanish as their first language and more than half are foreign-born, compassion for migrants runs deep.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cyclical,\u201d said Rene Ramos, the head archivist at Miami Dade College, which spearheaded the $65 million renovation. \u201cThis country has had moments where it clearly saw the value of immigrants and other moments when it did not. What we\u2019re doing here is reminding people what immigrants can accomplish when they\u2019re given the opportunity.\u201d",
      "The iconic building opened in 1925 as the headquarters of the once-acclaimed Miami Daily News, which shuttered decades ago. It was designed, in the style of a Moorish bell tower from Seville, Spain, by the New York architectural firm Schultze & Weaver, which was behind some of the most glamorous hotels, theaters and office towers of the era.",
      "It was renamed the Freedom Tower when President John F. Kennedy launched the Cuban Refugee Assistance Program to resettle the streams of middle-class individuals and families fleeing Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution. It\u2019s estimated that nearly 400,000 Cubans relied on services provided at the tower by the U.S. government in coordination with the then-fledgling Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami. The total cost of the refugee assistance ran over $730 million by 1971 \u2014 almost $6 billion in today's dollars \u2014 a U.S. government report from that year found.",
      "Known to the Spanish-speaking migrants as \u201cEl Refugio,\u201d or \u201cThe Refuge,\u201d it was a safe place to get vaccines, fill out paperwork, and receive financial assistance of around $120 per month. In the Grand Hall, with its giant windows and Corinthian columns, the Pizarra de la Suerte \u2014 the Bulletin Board of Good Luck \u2014 carried job notices to help the Cubans adjust to their new life, according to a replica of the hall in the museum.",
      "At the time, metropolitan Miami was a tropical tourist town, with fewer than 1 million inhabitants. Most \u00e9migr\u00e9s fanned out across the United States.",
      "\u201cThey weren\u2019t staying in Miami because they didn\u2019t want warmth and sunshine. There were no jobs,\u201d said Madeline Pumariega, the president of Miami Dade College, whose own Cuban parents hightailed it to Amarillo, Texas, after arriving here.",

      "Jorge Malag\u00f3n, who teaches history at Miami Dade College, was just 5 when he arrived. But he still wells up recalling the hardship of his departure \u2014 when Cuban customs officials ripped open his teddy bear looking for contraband jewelry \u2014 and arriving in Miami on a \u201cFreedom Flight\u201d paid for by the U.S. government and being immediately shuttled in a school bus from the tarmac to the Freedom Tower.",
      "\u201cThe memories never go away,\u201d said Malag\u00f3n, who recalls being welcomed with a bar of unfamiliar peanut butter and a block of government cheese. \u201cTo this day, a grilled cheese sandwich with cheap, Velveeta processed cheese is still comfort food to me.\u201d",
      "The Freedom Tower, a national historic landmark, was long ago overtaken by Miami\u2019s fast-growing steel and glass skyline. Abandoned for years, it was rescued in 1997 by Cuban American businessman Jorge Mas Canosa, a top exile opponent of Castro. He later sold it to a prominent Cuban American family and it was then donated to Miami Dade College.",
      "Even in a dilapidated state, the tower remained a mecca of the Cuban diaspora. In 2003, tens of thousands of salsa fans gathered here to show their respects to Cuban-born singer Celia Cruz. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose parents migrated from Cuba, used it as the backdrop to announce his bid for the U.S. presidency in 2015.",
      "The current restoration was funded by $25 million investment from the state of Florida, with additional funding from MDC, private donors and federal government grants.",

They include exhibits dedicated to Victims of Communism, the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that the CIA organized against Castro, and the 14,000 unaccompanied minors sent by their parents as part of the U.S.-led Operation Peter Pan.",
      "Giant media screens project scenes of protest and acts of courage by newer residents of the Magic City fleeing persecution in Venezuela, Haiti and Nicaragua. There\u2019s also a makeshift recording studio for those who passed through the Freedom Tower to add their testimony to an archive of over 300 oral history interviews with exiles, including prominent voices like singer Gloria Estefan.",
      "Emerging from the dark galleries of often traumatic stories of dislocation and exile, the museum\u2019s final stop is a gallery flooded with all the sun, salsa and pastel hues that make modern-day Miami so beloved.",
      "\u201cMiami and the world would not be what it is today without them,\u201d said Pumariega. \u201cThat\u2019s important and so is the contributions that immigrants play in our country, and I think will continue to play beyond this moment.\u201d",

      "A huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska\u2019s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, sending a potentially record surge of flooding toward parts of Juneau in what has become an annual concern for residents",
      "A huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska\u2019s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, and officials on Tuesday urged residents in some parts of Juneau to evacuate ahead of what could be a record surge of floodwater downstream.",
      "Officials in recent days have been warning people in the flood zone to be ready to evacuate. On Tuesday morning they confirmed water had started escaping the ice dam and flowing downstream, with flooding expected late Tuesday into Wednesday.",
      "Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. Government agencies installed a temporary levy this year in hopes of guarding against widespread damage.",
      "\u201cThis will be a new record, based on all of the information that we have,\u201d Nicole Ferrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist, told a news conference Tuesday.",

The basin itself was left behind when a smaller glacier nearby retreated.",
      "When the water in the basin builds up enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam, entering Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River. Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping over the weekend, the water level was rising rapidly \u2014 as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service.",

This year's flooding was predicted to crest at between 16.3 and 16.8 feet (4.96 to 5.12 meters).",

      "City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The installation of about 10,000, four-foot (1.2-meter) tall barriers is intended to protect more than 460 properties from flood levels similar to last year, said Nate Rumsey, deputy director with the city\u2019s engineering and public works department.",

      "MASON, Tenn. -- Officials in a rural Tennessee town voted Tuesday to approve agreements to turn a former prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious public meeting.",
      "The five-member Board of Aldermen in Mason, plus Mayor Eddie Noeman and Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan, met in a fire station garage to discuss converting the closed West Tennessee Detention Facility into a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center run by CoreCivic Inc.",
      "Also present were a few dozen vocal, angry members of the public who oppose allowing ICE to house immigrants in Mason who have been taken into custody as President Donald Trump pushes for mass deportations. Trump has touted a Florida detention facility where allegations of mistreatment of detainees have drawn lawsuits from civil rights advocates and environmental groups.",
      "The first vote of the meeting resulted in approval for a contract with CoreCivic to resume operating the facility, which was closed in 2021 after President Joe Biden ordered the Department of Justice to stop renewing contracts with private detention facilities. Trump reversed that order in January. The second vote, to approve an agreement with ICE, also passed.",
      "It is not immediately known when the facility will reopen.",
      "Noeman said he wanted to reopen the shuttered prison to bring jobs and economic development to the town, which has struggled with financial problems and needs infrastructure improvements. With a population of about 1,300, Mason is located about 40 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Memphis. When it was open, the prison was the town\u2019s largest employer and an important economic engine.",
      "Noeman, an Egyptian-American immigrant and a longtime business owner in the town, called turning the closed prison over to CoreCivic and ICE a \u201cwin-win situation,\u201d which led to a cascade of loud boos.",
      "\u201cIt's nothing personal about any immigrant,\u201d Noeman said, adding moments later that \u201cto give jobs to the people is what I'm looking for.\u201d",
      "At times, Noeman argued with attendees, questioning whether they actually live in Mason and telling them \u201cyou don't know what you're talking about.\u201d",
      "Before the meeting, board member Virginia Rivers told The Associated Press that she does not support turning the prison into an ICE facility because \u201cI don't like what ICE stands for, how they treat the people.\u201d",
      "During the meeting, she noted that some immigrants without criminal records are being swept up by immigration agents and separated from their families. She said approving the contracts would make Mason \u201ccomplicit in the abusive treatment of immigrants.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe as officials of the town of Mason that were elected by the citizens should consider the consequences and the hurt that this would cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools and many families,\u201d Rivers said.",

The facility would also generate about $325,000 in annual property tax revenue and $200,000 for Mason that could be used for schools, infrastructure improvements and other projects, the company said.",
      "\u201cThe services we provide\u202fhelp the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone \u2014 to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively,\u201d CoreCivic said.",
      "In 2022, Mason reached a deal with the state of Tennessee after it attempted to take over the city's finances following years of alleged mismanagement. Some members of the public who spoke at the meeting said Mason is a majority-Black town with a history of being ignored and treated with disrespect.",
      "One of the speakers, Charles Watkins, noted that CoreCivic was the operator of the prison under its previous name, Corrections Corporation of America.",

      "Tennessee\u2019s corrections agency has fined CoreCivic $44.7 million across four prisons from 2022 through February, including for understaffing violations. Records obtained by AP also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment \u2014 including at least 22 inmate deaths \u2014 at four Tennessee prisons and two jails from 2016 through September 2024.",

    "summary": "Taylor Swift announced her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" after a countdown tease on her website. She didn't say when it would be released.",
    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift has announced her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" Swift put out the word on her website shortly after a countdown timer expired at 12:12 a.m. Tuesday. No release date was announced, but her site said vinyl editions of the album would ship before Oct. 13.",
      "Fans have long theorized that Swift's 12th album would be released soon.",
      "On Monday, Taylor Nation \u2014 an official branch of the pop superstar's marketing team \u2014 posted a TikTok slide show of 12 images with the caption \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era...'\" Swift is seen wearing orange in every image.",
      "A special limited vinyl edition of the album will be released in \"portofino orange glitter,\" according to a pre-order page on her site. The vinyl version of the album is available for pre-order on the site for $29.99. The cassette version is going for $19.99 and a CD with a poster of Swift is priced at $12.99.",
      "Sensing a pattern, eagle-eyed fans noticed that 12 minutes before the Taylor Nation post, the popular \"New Heights\" podcast posted a tease\u00a0for Wednesday. The show, hosted by Swift's boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce alongside his brother, former Eagles center Jason Kelce, posted an orange image on social media with a mysterious silhouette, many believing to be Swift.",
      "Swift also announced early Tuesday that she would appear on the podcast and a teaser video posted about her appearance showed her pulling the album from a briefcase. The actual album artwork, just as it is on her website, is blurred.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" follows last year's \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" announced during the 2024 Grammys and released during her record-breaking tour, which raked in over $2.2 billion across two years and five continents, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time. She's taken home 14 Grammys including an unheard-of four for album of the year.",
      "The album is also her first release since Swift regained control over her entire body of work. In May, she said she purchased her catalog of recordings \u2014 originally released through Big Machine Records \u2014 from their most recent owner, the private equity firm Shamrock Capital. She didn't disclose the purchase price.",
      "In recent years, Swift has been rerecording and releasing her first six albums in an attempt to regain control of her music. The project was instigated by Hybe America CEO Scooter Braun's purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift's effort to control her own songs and how they're used.",
      "Previous \"Taylor's Version\" releases have been more than conventional re-recordings, arriving with new \"from the vault\" music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work.",
      "So far, there have been four rerecorded albums, beginning with \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" and \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" in 2021. All four have been massive commercial and cultural successes, with each debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Swift's last rerecording, \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\" That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

    "summary": "Eddie Palmieri was the first Latino to win a Grammy and won seven more over a career spanning nearly 40 albums.",
    "story": [
      "Eddie Palmieri, the avant-garde musician who was one of the most innovative artists of rumba and Latin jazz, has died. He was 88 years old.",
      "Fania Records announced Palmieri's death Wednesday evening. Palmieri's daughter, Gabriela,\u00a0told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after \"an extended illness.\"",
      "The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums.",
      "Palmieri's family released the following statement:",
      "\"Eddie Palmieri, the legendary Puerto Rican pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader, passed away on August 6, 2025, at the age of 88, leaving behind a transformative legacy in Latin jazz and salsa. A ten-time Grammy Award winner and the first-ever recipient of a Grammy for Latin music, Palmieri revolutionized the genre with his bold, percussive style and deep Afro-Caribbean roots, founding the groundbreaking band La Perfecta and mentoring generations of musicians over a remarkable seven-decade career. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 60 years, Iraida, whom he lovingly called 'Mi Luz Mayor,' and is survived by his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a global community of friends and collaborators who felt his passion and generosity. Featured proudly in Spike Lee's upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, Palmieri's influence transcended music -- his rhythm changed the world, and his spirit will live on in every beat he inspired.\"",
      "\"Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\"",
      "Palmieri was born in New York's Spanish Harlem on Dec. 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13 he began playing timbales in his uncle's orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums.",
      "He eventually abandoned the instrument and went back to the playing piano.",
      "\"I'm a frustrated percussionist, so I take it out on the piano,\" the musician once said in his website biography.",
      "His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album \"The Sun of Latin Music,\" and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams.",
      "In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: \"Learning to play the piano well. ... Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\"",
      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed's band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez's before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Pioneering Grammy winner's career spanned decades and genres",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \"V\u00e1monos pa'l monte,\" with his brother, Charlie, as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",
      "Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of \"Harlem River Drive,\" in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz.",
      "Later, in 1974, he recorded \"The Sun of Latin Music\" with a young Lalo Rodr\u00edguez. The album became the first Latin production to win a Grammy.",
      "The following year he recorded the album \"Eddie Palmieri & Friends in Concert, Live at the University of Puerto Rico,\" considered by many fans to be a salsa gem.",
      "In the 1980s, he won two more Grammy Awards, for the albums \"Palo pa' rumba\" (1984) and \"Solito\" (1985). A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production \"Lleg\u00f3 La India v\u00eda Eddie Palmieri.\"",
      "Palmieri released the album \"Masterpiece\" in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year. It was a hit with critics and won two Grammy Awards. The album was also chosen as the most outstanding production of the year by the National Foundation for Popular Culture of Puerto Rico.",
      "During his long career, he participated in concerts and recordings with the Fania All-Stars and Tico All-Stars, standing out as a composer, arranger, producer, and orchestra director.",
      "In 1988, the Smithsonian Institute recorded two of Palmieri's concerts for the catalog of the National Museum of American History in Washington.",
      "Yale University in 2002 awarded him the Chubb Fellowship Award, an award usually reserved for international heads of state, in recognition of his work in building communities through music.",
      "In 2005, he made his debut on National Public Radio as the host of the program \"Caliente,\" which was carried by more than 160 radio stations nationwide.",
      "He worked with renowned musicians such as timbalero Nicky Marrero, bassist Israel \"Cachao\" L\u00f3pez, trumpeter Alfredo \"Chocolate\" Armenteros, trombonist Lewis Khan, and Puerto Rican bassist Bobby Valent\u00edn.",
      "In 2010, Palmieri said he felt a bit lonely musically due to the deaths of many of the rumberos with whom he enjoyed playing with.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "When astronaut James Lovell (March 25, 1928-Aug. 7, 2025) was launched aboard Apollo 8, just four days before Christmas 1968, NASA's flight director believed they only had a 50% chance of coming home safely. \"Some of the odds of trying to be successful in that mission are overwhelming, and perhaps at that time we didn't even understand what the odds were,\" Lovell told \"CBS Evening News\" in 2018.",
      "That Christmas Eve, they became the first human crew to circle the moon. \"We're like three schoolkids looking into a candy store window, watching those ancient old craters on the far side, slowly slip underneath us,\" Lovell told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018.",
      "But the truly moving sight was when they viewed their home planet rise above the surface. \"I could put my thumb up to the window, and completely hide the Earth,\" Lovell said. \"You have to think about that \u2013 over five billion people, everything I ever knew, was behind my thumb!\"",
      "A U.S. Naval Academy graduate and test pilot, Lovell joined the space program in 1962, becoming one of NASA's most traveled astronauts during its first decade. Lovell flew into space four times: aboard Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13.",
      "It was that last mission, in 1970, that proved the most harrowing. Apollo 13's service module, carrying Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, experienced a sudden oxygen tank explosion on its way to the moon. \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" Swigert and Lovell radioed.",
      "With the landing mission scrapped, Lovell and his crewmates moved into the cramped lunar lander to use as a lifeboat, as hundreds of flight controllers and engineers worked to guide the damaged spacecraft back home. With the crew's life support dwindling, the world watched gripped in suspense over their four-day journey back to Earth.",
      "Lovell's calm demeanor during the mission (which was dramatized in the film \"Apollo 13,\" starring Tom Hanks) fixed his public image, underscoring the heroism of astronauts working in the deadly environment of space. Though disappointed he never got to walk on the moon, Lovell understood that, in some ways, the failed mission was a success. \"Going to the moon, if everything works right, it's like following a cookbook. It's not that big a deal,\" he told the AP in 2004. \"If something goes wrong, that's what separates the men from the boys.\""

    "published": "Sun, 10 Aug 2025 10:36:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Billy Wilder's caustic tale of Hollywood, obsession and murder, in which a fading star of silent pictures tries to recreate her fame, is back in its full dark glory.",
    "story": [
      "There are some movies where just about every line is quotable. Take Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece \"Sunset Boulevard,\" which premiered 75 years ago this month.",
      "Gillis: \"You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big.\"Desmond: \"I AM big. It's the pictures that got small.\"",
      "The film was anything but small! The legendary director had Gloria Swanson as the rejected silent film star, Norma Desmond, who seemed to be going quietly out of her mind; and William Holden as the failed screenwriter Joe Gillis, who became her kept man.",
      "\"She was 52 at the time; William Holden was 31,\" said UT Austin film professor Noah Isenberg. \"The age difference was extraordinary. Today we might not think much of it, but it was big.\"",
      "Isenberg says the noir \"Sunset Boulevard\" tested the limits of what a 1950 audience would bear. The opening scene is gruesome enough, with the murdered Gillis face down in a swimming pool. But the film originally started in the L.A. morgue, with Gillis and other cadavers talking about how they got there. \u00a0Isenberg said, \"It was too dark, too morbid. Audiences weren't ready for it. Instead, you have John Seitz's camera trained on that curb.\" Appropriately, the film begins in the gutter.",
      "The original film, now restored in glorious 4K ultra hi-def, is available from Paramount.",
      "Nancy Olson was only 21 when she played aspiring writer Betty Schaefer opposite Holden's Gillis. Olson, now 97, says Holden's air of desperation in the film mirrored what was happening in his life. \"His career was dying,\" she said. \"And that's the character. If you look carefully, you will see one of the most extraordinary, real performances of a man who gave up his soul for survival.\"",
      "Still, Olson says they got along famously on set, especially when director Wilder lined them up for their first-ever love scene in a crowded studio where some of the cast's family members happened to be present: \"And we got to the end, where Bill says to my character, 'What happened?' And I turn to him slowly and answer, 'You did.' Whereupon he takes me into his arms and gently starts to kiss me.",
      "\"Now, Billy said, 'Do not separate until I say cut.' And we both were enjoying this. And all of a sudden, there was a female voice saying, 'Cut, damn it! Cut!' It was Mrs. Holden! I never got over it. But I learned something.\"",
      "What was that? \"Bill and I loved to kiss!\"",
      "And moviegoers loved the film: \"Sunset Boulevard\" got 11 Academy Award nominations. \"I was shocked,\" Olsen said of the Oscar nods. \"Now, we didn't win. But we've outlasted everybody.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for the 75th anniversary release of \"Sunset Boulevard\" click on the video player below:",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard\" was later re-born as a musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sir Andrew was intrigued by the story of Hollywood discarding aging stars, and got the blessing of Wilder, who by then was being gently phased out of Hollywood himself \u2013 in his own way getting the Norma Desmond treatment. Webber said, \"He does tell a wonderful story about him going to see some young movie executive who had just been there. And this young executive says to him, 'Um, well, Mr. Wilder, we're very impressed by this screenplay that you've done, but it would be really helpful if you could tell me what you have done in the past?'\"",
      "The director of such classics as \"Double Indemnity,\" \"The Lost Weekend,\" \"Ace in the Hole,\" \"Some Like It Hot,\" and \"The Apartment,\" turned to the young executive and said, \"You first.\"",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard,\" the musical, opened in London's West End in 1993, with Patti LuPone as Desmond; when they brought the show to Los Angeles and New York, Glenn Close played the lead.",
      "And in the latest, radically re-conceived version, Desmond was played by former pop star Nicole Scherzinger.",
      "Asked about seeing Scherzinger in the role of Norma Desmond, Webber said, \"I have always rated Nicole as one of the most astounding singers I've ever worked with. And I worked with a few. And I could say that Nicole is right up there with the very, very, very top ones, might even be the best.\"",
      "Scherzinger brought a new level of intensity to Norma Desmond, and took home a Tony Award this year.",
      "You can stream the Broadway cast album of \"Sunset Blvd.\" featuring Nicole Scherzinger by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "The show closed last month, and we took Scherzinger back to the St. James Theatre just before they took down all the signs. \"I can't believe that this is still up; I want to take it home!\" she laughed. \"I want to take it home and I want to put this in my garage.\"",
      "One sign was half-removed from the stage door. \"I think someone stole my face!\" she laughed.",
      "Asked what she thinks \"Sunset Boulevard\" says about the entertainment industry and its treatment of older women, Scherzinger said, \"It's difficult that the industry kind of puts an expiration date on you when you've actually lived a life and actually, finally, have something really meaningful to say.\"",
      "Hollywood has changed (and so has Paramount Pictures). But seventy-five years on, \"Sunset Boulevard\" still holds up. Isenberg said, \"For people who love movies \u2013 cinephiles and film geeks, whatever we want to call them today \u2013 you can just luxuriate in a movie like 'Sunset Boulevard.' It's like a warm bath.\"",
      "Gloria Swanson herself luxuriated in playing a faded movie queen. Even back then, she somehow knew that \"Sunset Boulevard\" would make her a legend.",
      "Asked if Swanson was anything like the character she portrayed, Nancy Olson replied, \"No. She was much more real and sensible. And she was the only person on the entire set that understood that this movie would live forever and that she would be remembered forever \u2013 that it was a story that had a truth to it that would never be forgotten.\"",

    "title": "Why is Instagram's new Map feature controversial, and should you disable it?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instagram-map-disable/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:16:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food-poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, but recent reports point to ongoing sanitation problems.",
    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

      "The investment - the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history - is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes - tariffs - on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",

      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters - now made in China - will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex - known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",

      "That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year \u2014 among other challenges and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida-based company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "More Americans are cutting back on travel this year because of economic worries, according to a recent LendingTree study.",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its looming debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "Those furloughs and downgrades, both announced in July, are set to go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts taken before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit on Monday stressed that it needs more liquidity. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made the airline an attractive takeover target over the years. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market is rallying toward records on Tuesday after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",
      "The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They're betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",
      "\"Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\"",
      "Other central banks around the world have been lowering interest rates, and Australia's on Tuesday cut for the third time this year.",
      "On Wall Street, Intel's stock rose 5.1% after Trump said its CEO has an \"amazing story,\" less than a week after he had demanded Lip-Bu Tan's resignation.",
      "Circle Internet Group, the company behind the popular USDC cryptocurrency that tracks the U.S. dollar, climbed 2.4% despite reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, and it topped forecasts.",
      "On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 14.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",
      "Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market's expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.",
      "Critics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That's putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world's second-largest economy by 90 days. The move was widely expected, and the hope is that it will clear the way for a possible deal to avert a dangerous trade war between the United States and China.",
      "Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.1%, and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5% for two of the world's bigger moves.",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.29% from 4.27% late Monday.",
      "The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.73% from 3.76%.",

    "summary": "The inflation rate was cooler than expected, with July's CPI rising 2.7% on an annual basis.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in July rose 2.7% on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.8% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, in line with economists' forecasts.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",
      "FactSet gives an 88% probability of a rate cut at the meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",

      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",

      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",

Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",

      "What does the executive order change about 401(k)s?",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under\u00a0401(k) retirement\u00a0rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",
      "After the Labor Department provides its new guidance, it will take time for major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard to develop appropriate funds for employers to use.",
      "Employers will also likely need time to revise their retirement plan options, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity become mainstream investments in individual retirement plans. Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility. For instance, private equity invests in companies that are not publicly traded, which makes it difficult to know on a day-to-day basis whether the investment is up, down or sideways.",
      "\"When it comes to investing in stocks, retail investors are used to instant pricing, clean data and daily performance updates,\" Tang said. \"Private markets are a different ballgame. There's no real-time information, no ticker and no standardization, just fragmented documents and unstructured formats.\"",
      "Cryptocurrencies, for their part, may have more transparency on pricing, but they can also be extremely volatile, with major shifts in valuation from day to day. That said, cryptocurrencies have grown increasingly popular, with about 1 in 4 people investing in crypto, according to Security.org.",
      "Do alternative investments outperform stocks and bonds?",
      "Alternative investments can outperform stocks and bonds, but there's no guarantee.",
      "For instance, bitcoin last year jumped 135% in value, compared with a 24% increase in the S&P 500. But in 2022, it was another story, with bitcoin dropping 65% while the S&P 500 lost 19%, one analysis shows.",
      "Private equity investments, meanwhile, returned 13.5% over a 10-year period, outpacing the 9.7% return for stocks and a 1.9% for bonds over the same period, according to a recent study.",
      "While the potential for outsized gains may appeal to some investors, alternative investments also tend to carry higher costs, such as pricier fees for fund managers, which can eat into returns.",
      "\"Higher costs come from the fact that while you can trade a stock for pennies, it requires travel, negotiations, legal work, and much more, to buy and operate a private company. These costs are typically passed along to fund investors,\" Pitchbook said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday, after he fired the former commissioner earlier this month, blaming her for a weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He's defended Mr. Trump's economic policy moves in the past, including the president's tariff strategy. He has also\u00a0criticized the BLS\u00a0for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "story": [
      "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.",
      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\"Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\"This case is about abuse of power,\" the lawsuit says. \"Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\"Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\"",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract\u00a0with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \"Japan's Babe Ruth\" and the \"1st Resident,\" giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \"one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\" Hapuna Beach, \"rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\" and two golf courses \u2014 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",
      "\"Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\" the brochure says. \"He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\"",
      "Ohtani touted the project as his upcoming \"winter home\" in April, CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV reported at the time",
      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \"as part of a bold marketing strategy\" signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \"one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",
      "\"This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\" the investment brochure said. \"We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\"",
      "The suit said Balelo \"quickly became a disruptive force,\" threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made.",
      "\"Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,\" the suit said. \"Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\"",
      "Last month, in what the suit called \"a coordinated ambush,\" Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.",
      "\"Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\" the suit said. \"Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement it will maintain a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

      "U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue generated by sales of their AI chips in China, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",
      "In a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.",
      "\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"",
      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",
      "The revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.",
      "The H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.",
      "It is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.",
      "Nvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"",
      "AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stocks for both companies rose slightly on Monday.",
      "Proponents of restrictions on sales of advanced chips to China say they are necessary to ensure the U.S. maintains a competitive edge as the two countries battle for AI dominance. They've also been viewed as a security safeguard. In one instance during the Biden administration, the Commerce Department said it was updating its export controls and said advanced AI capabilities \"present U.S. national security concerns.\"",
      "\"These controls were strategically crafted to address, among other concerns, the PRC's efforts to obtain semiconductor manufacturing equipment essential to producing advanced integrated circuits needed for the next generation of advanced weapon systems,\" the department said in a 2023\u00a0release.",

    "story": [
      "Ford is investing $5 billion to change the way it makes electric vehicles, a move the automaker says will allow it to manufacture models starting at $30,000 \u2014 far less than the current average price for an EV.",
      "The Dearborn, Michigan-based company on Monday said it will invest $2 billion to modernize its Louisville Assembly Plant and another $3 billion to build a new battery plant in Michigan, part of its push to produce more affordable EVs.",
      "The company unveiled its new \"universal EV platform\" at a Monday event, with Ford CEO Jim Farley calling it \"the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" which Ford introduced in 1908.",
      "According to Ford, the new assembly line will be structured more like an \"assembly tree,\" with three different lines that converge into one, rather than a single assembly belt.",
      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",
      "The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.",
      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",
      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Field touted the new vehicle's charging capabilities, referring to the truck as a \"mobile power plant.\"",
      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",
      "\"If Ford shows the industry it can build and sell a reliable compact EV truck for $30,000, it will sell a lot of them, and open the door to making sedans using the new production process,\" Anderson said.",

      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer, which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com.

    "summary": "While many Americans are still baffled by cryptocurrency, enthusiasm for these digital assets is growing - despite the potential risks of integrating digital currencies with the mainstream economy - in part due to support coming from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, more than 35,000 bitcoin enthusiasts descended on Las Vegas for Bitcoin 2025 \u2013 the largest-ever gathering of its kind, attracting an eclectic mix of high rollers ... and true believers.",
      "\"Your goal should be to own at least one bitcoin, because by the time you retire, that can be worth 20, 30 million,\" said Michael Terpin.",
      "Guy Malone said, \"You can't change the Bible; it changes you. The same is true of bitcoin.\"",
      "But everyone here seems to agree on one thing: President Donald Trump's reelection has been like hitting the jackpot. As Vice President JD Vance told the crowd, \"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.\"",
      "Once dismissed by investors, and still baffling to many Americans, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have won over supporters from Wall Street to Washington. In July, the president signed the Genius Act, which opens the door for companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon to issue their own digital currencies.",
      "And Congress is debating another bill that, for the first time, aims to regulate cryptocurrency trading \u2013 this after the industry spent more than $167 million on behalf of crypto-friendly candidates ahead of last year's election.",
      "Asked how people should think of cryptocurrencies, Amanda Fischer, who served as a top official in the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration, replied, \"You could think of it as gambling, you could think of it as a collectible, you could think of it as a type of investment. But I think what's important to understand is that crypto is highly volatile. It's highly speculative.",
      "\"Crypto is often marketed to individuals as an investment opportunity that will yield them the possibility of great returns,\" she said. \"But unlike, say, a stock, which represents a part-ownership of a company, [crypto] is not backed by any sort of business that is producing goods and services.\"",
      "Unlike hard currencies like the dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies only exist online, and are issued by individuals and companies, not central banks. And yet, billions of dollars' worth of crypto are traded every day. \"The number of scams, the types of scams, the sophistication of scams are so rife and plentiful that the capacity to lose your money in a crypto investment is substantially higher than if you're just investing in stocks and bonds,\" Fischer said.",
      "During the Biden administration, the SEC cracked down on the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump administration has changed course, dismissing the largest outstanding cases, which Fischer says leaves consumers more vulnerable.",
      "I asked, \"We are seeing leaders in crypto say we want to be regulated. And there is legislation currently here in Washington underway to regulate cryptocurrency. They say they want laws passed.\"",
      "\"They want laws that they write to be passed,\" said Fischer. \"So, the legislation currently being considered in Washington, D.C., is written by and for the crypto industry.\"",
      "David Bailey, who runs the bitcoin conference and is CEO of a bitcoin holding company called Nakamoto, said, \"I wish that was the case, that'd be fantastic. But no, it's not true.\"",
      "The rise of digital assets",
      "Like many crypto entrepreneurs, Bailey now calls Puerto Rico home. \"It started because of the taxes,\" he said. \"Now, it's like the place to do business.\"",
      "But the 34-year-old's real claim to fame might be his role in convincing a skeptical President Trump (who in June 2021 told Fox Business Channel that bitcoin \"just seems like a scam\") to go all-in on bitcoin during the 2024 campaign. Asked what he told Mr. Trump to convince him to support crypto, Bailey replied, \"First off, no one convinces the president of anything. He makes up his own mind about things. A lot of people, especially in Washington, have missed how big this has gotten. And so, we made the case to the president about how many people hold this asset. He saw the opportunity that was here by embracing this industry. And I think we had a big part of swinging the election in his direction.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve says only eight percent of Americans have bought or held cryptocurrency in the last year, and only two percent have ever used it to buy anything. But digital assets are increasingly part of the economy. You may now be able to use crypto as collateral for a mortgage, and this past week the president signed an executive order to make it easier to hold cryptocurrencies in your 401(k).",
      "All the attention has helped drive the price of bitcoin to an all-time high, recently passing $120,000 each.",
      "Bailey says bitcoin was about $10 when he first bought it. Asked how much he bought, he replied, \"Well, you know, that's something I'm not going to talk about on camera. Not enough, let's just go like that. Not enough.\"",
      "And as crypto's fortunes have improved, so have the president's; CBS News estimates that crypto ventures controlled by the Trump family have made up to $765 million in revenue from token sales since the fall of 2024.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about the token sales, but in a statement told CBS News, \"Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Most experts in government ethics believe the situation is unprecedented.",
      "I asked Bailey, \"Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the president has changed his position on bitcoin and crypto because he can personally benefit from it, or his family can?\"",
      "\"No, absolutely not,\" said Bailey. \"I don't think he embraced this industry to enrich himself; I think that he just sees the same potential that I see. When you get excited about an idea, you feel compelled to do something about it.\"",
      "Trump Media buys $2 billion in bitcoin as it pursues crypto treasury strategy",
      "Trump Media buys $2 billion in bitcoin as it pursues crypto treasury strategy",
      "And that potential is why investors are betting that crypto will soon become part of everyday life. Vice President Vance told the audience at Bitcoin 2025, \"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.\"",
      "But for Amanda Fischer, that's a gamble not worth taking.",
      "\"We heard the same thing about subprime mortgages going into 2008,\" said Fischer. \"We heard the same thing about complex financial derivatives going into the last crisis, too. These products are wonderful and there are ways to extract so much value in wealth, until they're not. And I fear that crypto is going to follow down the same path. Things are going great many times, until they're not.\"",

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "summary": "Wendy's is facing softer consumer demand, with households earning less than $50,000 planning to cut back on eating out.",
    "story": [
      "Wendy's cut its sales outlook Friday, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Company executives discussed Wendy's challenges during a call with analysts Friday, following the release of its latest earnings report. Interim CEO Ken Cook said that in light of the current environment, the company now expects full-year global sales to decline between 3% and 5%, compared with previous\u00a0projections\u00a0of flat to down 2%.",
      "Wendy's is coping with softer consumer demand in 2025, particularly among the lower-income customers that tend to frequent fast-food chains, Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" she said.",
      "Fast food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "Cook, who stepped in as interim CEO after former Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner departed to lead the Hershey Company, cited \"a combination of dynamic consumer behavior and a more challenging competitive environment\" during a Friday call with analysts to discuss the results.",
      "While sales improved in May and June due to new Frosty offerings, \"overall demand recovered more slowly than we expected,\" he added. The burger chain's sales slipped 1.8% to $3.7 billion in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the company's earnings report.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers who are skipping breakfast could signal this growing pressure, with Wendy's executives highlighting the trend.",
      "\"Breakfast continued to perform worse than rest of day in the second quarter, which makes sense when you look at what's happening from a consumer behavior perspective,\" Cook said. \"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they that they do that with.\"",
      "Meanwhile, McDonald's, which last year saw a sales slowdown from low-income consumers, reversed that trend following its decision to\u00a0expand its value menu. CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts earlier in the week that value items \u2014 which include its $2.99 Snack Wrap \u2014 are bringing some consumers back to its stores even as fast food visits across the industry have slowed.",
      "Senatore said Wendy's provides good values for price-conscious consumers, but added the chain may not be communicating that as effectively as its competitors. \"McDonald's has done a good job of marketing value, and that is something that Wendy's acknowledged that they needed to do,\" she said.",
      "Among other value offerings is the Wendy's Biggie Bag, which features a junior bacon cheeseburger, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a soft drink for $5.",
      "Asked about adjusting core menu pricing during Friday's call, Cook said the company plans to use new data analytics capabilities to evaluate its prices.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely something that we'll look at,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 16:41:27 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "summary": "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food-poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, but recent reports point to ongoing sanitation problems.",
    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

      "According to a\u00a0blog\u00a0released Thursday by OpenAI, GPT\u20115's responses are approximately 45% less likely to contain a factual error than GPT\u20114o, and approximately 80% less likely to contain a factual error than OpenAI o3.",
      "As part of the new model, OpenAI is also reigning in ChatGPT's flattery. In its blog post, the company said GPT\u20115 is \"less effusively agreeable\" and that it will use \"fewer unnecessary emojis.\"",
      "OpenAI has also stepped up ChatGPT's coding abilities, allowing users to build websites, apps and games from scratch. In a demo during Wednesday's call, Altman used GPT-5 to create a web app in less than 5 minutes.",
      "Altman called the new chatbot's ability to write code on demand its \"superpower,\" adding that the advancement would have been \"unimaginable at any previous point in history.\"",
      "Asked about how the technology might impact the livelihood of human programmers, Altman said he thought the technology would actually create more job opportunities for as demand for software rises.",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

    "story": [
      "Louisville, Ky. \u2014 GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment - the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history - is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes - tariffs - on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states - Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters - now made in China - will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex - known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs - both directly and indirectly - through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

    "summary": "Lawyers for President Trump and Gov. Gavin Newsom faced off over the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles \u2014 and debated whether they were subject to a \"constitutional exception.",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for the state of California and the federal government faced off in court Tuesday over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.",
      "The attorney for the state, Meghan Strong, argued that having what she called a \"standing army\" in Los Angeles is \"unprecedented\" and goes against a \"deep-rooted policy against military involvement in civilian life.\" She said that Mr. Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"think that they can disregard that policy on a whim.\"",
      "Californians \"have been forced to endure anxiety and fear caused by the pervasive presence of this standing army,\" said Strong.",
      "Mr. Trump sent in around 700 Marines and 4,000 California National Guard troops to protect federal property and law enforcement agents during a series of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in early June. The deployment prompted a lawsuit from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called the move an illegal \"power grab.\"",
      "At issue in the three-day bench trial pitting Newsom against the Trump administration is whether the troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits military personnel from carrying out domestic law enforcement.",
      "Strong alleged that the federal government acted in violation of that 1878 law, saying troops were used to provide armed security for federal agents, set roadblocks and perimeters that restricted civilian movement, and detained civilians.",
      "California asked U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer for an injunction that would let the military protect federal property \u2014 like courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Justice Department, argued that the military deployment is legal, with the purpose of protecting federal property and personnel. He said that no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act exists.",
      "The federal government's only witness \u2014 Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who was at one point commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 said he was instructed \"that we were not conducting law enforcement operations and that we were there to serve the United States.\"",
      "\"We took our duty very seriously, and care and professionalism was always exhibited,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump justified the deployment using a law called Title 10, which allows the president to call up Guard forces during a \"rebellion,\" or if he is unable \"with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" In an early June memo, Mr. Trump said the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion\" and endangered federal agents.",
      "Breyer had previously ruled that Mr. Trump used Title 10 unlawfully, but he was overruled by an appellate court that said Mr. Trump had discretion to decide if that law applied.",
      "Since then, most of the troops have left Los Angeles, with roughly 300 Guard forces remaining. But the issue has drawn more attention in recent days, as the Trump administration deploys National Guard forces to Washington, D.C.",
      "The administration says that deployment is necessary to support law enforcement and crack down on violent crime, but local leaders have condemned the federal government's intervention.",
      "Strong cautioned that \"Los Angeles is only the beginning,\" citing recent comments from Mr. Trump that she said indicated he may deploy the National Guard to other cities, including Oakland and New York.",
      "A \"constitutional exception?\"",
      "Parts of Tuesday's testimony hinged on an alleged \"constitutional exception\" to the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "At one point, Sherman referred to a \"constitutional exception.\" He testified that he was advised federal troops were allowed to do \"four things\" that would normally be barred under the law \u2014 security patrols, traffic control, crowd control and riot control \u2014 \"because it was in line with what the President was directing\" and \"what the Secretary of Defense was directing.\"",
      "But Judge Breyer was unaware of such an exception and pressed Sherman on the issue.",
      "\"I'm not a lawyer,\" said Sherman.",
      "\"That may be to your credit,\" responded Breyer.",
      "Breyer later asked if Sherman ever received legal advice that if the Guard task force engaged in certain activities, it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Sherman testified that he was told, since Mr. Trump's memo said the Los Angeles protests were a form of rebellion that prevented federal agents from doing their jobs, that triggered the constitutional exception. \"This is all the way from the top of DOD down to Task Force 51,\" he said.",
      "California's attorney, Strong, disputed this \"mysterious constitutional exception,\" arguing that neither the president nor the secretary of defense \"can create an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act.\"",
      "\"That means all the directives we've seen the past two days are wrong and what they told soldiers to do was illegal,\" she said. \"Those directives are based on a constitutional exception that doesn't exist.\"",
      "One exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act, which lets the president use the military to enforce the law during an insurrection. Mr. Trump has not invoked that law.",
      "\"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\"",
      "Mr. Trump's description of the Los Angeles protests as a \"rebellion\" was raised again in court on Tuesday, after Sherman testified Monday that he didn't hear the term used to describe the demonstrations.",
      "Sherman clarified on Tuesday that he knew Mr. Trump's memo called the protests a rebellion.",
      "The judge later pushed back against the idea that Mr. Trump has the discretion to decide if a \"rebellion\" is occurring. \"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\" Breyer asked, repeatedly.",
      "The federal government's attorney, Hamilton, said that the president is commander in chief, and he's entitled to deference in that judgment. But when asked by the judge multiple times, he acknowledged that it doesn't make it a rebellion.",
      "Breyer further questioned Mr. Trump's ability to dictate what the law allows, when Hamilton argued that there was no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act because the military was serving a protective function in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Are you saying that because the president says it, therefore it is?\" said Breyer.",
      "\"If the president says you can do X,\" he continued, \"because the president has said it, that's sufficient to take it out of the Posse Comitatus Act?\"",
      "The trial will conclude on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced this week the deployment of 800 members of the D.C. National Guard to the District of Columbia, as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "The president is also temporarily taking control of the District's Metropolitan Police Department. Hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers have also joined the effort recently, from a variety of agencies fanning out across the city.",
      "\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference Monday.",
      "The Army has activated the D.C. National Guard to \"assist law enforcement in the nation's capital,\" it said in a statement and added that of the approximately 800 soldiers activated, 100 to 200 would be supporting law enforcement at any given time on an \"array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in the District.",
      "What is the National Guard doing in D.C.?",
      "The District of Columbia is unique in that it's controlled by the federal government, which means the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard.",
      "For now, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Guard members will be supporting federal agents, as they recently did in Los Angeles, when they were brought in after protests against Trump administration immigration policies to help protect federal property and personnel enforcing the policies.",
      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude. But they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.\"",
      "He elaborated on how they might be utilized, saying, \"You can help somebody, interdict, temporarily detain like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement.\"",
      "And Hegseth also said the Guard members in D.C. are \"going to be proactive.\"",
      "\"If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\" he told Ingraham.",
      "The Army on Tuesday posted photos of the National Guard near the Washington Monument on X with the comment, \"D.C. National Guard reporting for duty.\"\u00a0Some of the vehicles\u00a0appeared to belong to the D.C. National Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, which often helps with security for high-profile D.C. events like presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations, the unit's website says.",
      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Before they're sent to the D.C. streets, the service members will receive additional training on de-escalation tactics and rules for the use of force, according to defense officials.",
      "Hegseth said Monday at the White House that other guardsmen from other states and other \"specialized units\" are prepared to deploy to D.C. if needed.",
      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",
      "Before Mr. Trump's announcement Monday, the White House was already deploying federal law enforcement officers onto D.C. streets as a part of an effort to make the city cleaner and safer.",
      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",
      "James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

It feels like most of the CDC community is really trying to unify and support each other.\" A union message referred to the meeting, which lasted from 11:12 a.m. to 11:24 a.m., as \"insultingly insufficient,\" and invited workers to a noon healing session.",
      "\"Dr. Monarez and CDC leadership remain focused on supporting staff during an extraordinarily difficult time as evidenced by their continued direct engagement,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News. \"Friday's shooting was a traumatic event for the agency, and leadership is working to provide continued updates along with resources for healing and recovery. There will be continued opportunities for staff engagement and dialogue in the days ahead.\"",
      "Several employees praised separate Saturday and Tuesday calls for the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, led by Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, describing them as \"validating,\" with clear next steps and mental-health resources. Monarez joined the Saturday call and \"was more natural and less scripted,\" a staffer said.",
      "On Tuesday, Daskalakis told staff, \"We've experienced a horrific and intentionally targeted attack \u2026 we're shocked, we're grieving, we're scared,\" and he urged teams to use the space to speak frankly. He emphasized that CDC would take \"time and space before we come back,\" noting the investigation is \"complex and ongoing.\"",
      "The meeting centered on mental health and resources to support traumatized staffers. Daskalakis introduced Dr. David Schonfeld of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, who walked through common post-crisis reactions.",
      "\"Most people try and hide their distress,\" he said, encouraging employees to seek support rather than suppress their feelings. Trying to do so, he added, \"is not a superpower.\"",
      "Daskalakis noted reports that the suspect was angry about COVID-19 vaccines and influenced by conspiracy theories. \"This is not our fault,\" he said. \"Our work is love and what we experienced is hate.\"",
      "Many of the CDC's centers are currently led by acting directors, after several center directors were reassigned to the Indian Health Service earlier this year.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the CDC's campus on Monday, three days after the attack, while most staff were instructed by leadership to telework due to safety concerns and the ongoing assessments following the shootings. On the same day that he visited the CDC, Kennedy gave an interview to Scripps News in which he once again raised questions about vaccine safety, drawing sharp criticism from some CDC staff, who argued that anti-vaccine rhetoric, including from Kennedy, helped create the conditions for the attack.",
      "HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon told CBS News, \"This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce and we hope the media will respect the moment rather than exploiting a tragedy and further exacerbating an already harrowing experience by the dedicated CDC staff.\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"Violence has no place in any civil society, and the White House extends our heartfelt condolences to the family of Officer David Rose and the entire CDC team.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:57:28 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has installed four U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation, prompting questions about checks on executive power.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in several states have rejected President Trump's controversial picks for top prosecutor posts in a rare standoff between the courts and the White House, but those acting U.S. attorneys will nonetheless remain in place because of actions taken by the president and the Justice Department.",
      "Last month in New York and New Jersey, panels of federal district judges declined to appoint two of Mr. Trump's interim choices to serve as U.S. attorneys \u2013 John Sarcone III of New York and Alina Habba of New Jersey. By law, if the Senate fails to confirm a nominee for a judicial post within 120 days, the District Court can extend the interim appointee or select someone else to serve in an acting capacity until a presidential nominee is confirmed.",
      "In New York, the court declined to extend the interim top prosecutor but also declined to appoint an acting U.S. attorney.",
      "In New Jersey, a panel of judges replaced Habba with Desiree Leigh Grace, the first assistant to the U.S. attorney and the next-highest ranking prosecutor in that office. Within hours, however, the Justice Department fired Grace and installed Habba as acting U.S. attorney, extending her term for another 210 days.",
      "To keep Sarcone in place, Attorney General Pam Bondi named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" effectively giving him the power of a U.S. attorney, and he was named first assistant U.S. attorney, leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "The Trump administration employed similar maneuvers in Nevada and California in late July, this time appointing both interim U.S. attorneys in an acting capacity before the judges were to vote. Those two are Bilal \"Bill\" Essayli in California, and Sigal Chattah in Nevada.",
      "Why some of the acting U.S. attorneys have faced resistance",
      "The clash with the judiciary has come as some legal experts have expressed concern about actions taken by these Trump appointees or by comments they've made.",
      "Essayli, a former assistant U.S. attorney for California, has been accused of politicizing the office by pushing his staff to pursue cases regarded as being aligned with Trump's interests. This has contributed to an exodus from the Los Angeles-based district, Bloomberg Law reported. Essayli is the only one of the four who has prior experience as a prosecutor.",
      "Chattah was in private practice and previously ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general in Nevada. Critics have also accused her of using public office to pursue prosecutions of her political opponents and criticized her use of racially charged language in the past.",
      "A group of more than 100 former judges sent a letter to the District Court in Nevada, urging the judicial panel to reject the extension of Chattah's appointment on the grounds of inflammatory remarks she had made in the past. In 2022, she said of her opponent state attorney general's race, Aaron Ford, who is Black, that he should be \"hanging from a f****** crane.\"",
      "Chattah, an Israeli, said the comment was not racist and is just a common Israeli saying. Ford won the election and is still in office as Nevada's attorney general.",
      "Habba was one of Mr. Trump's\u00a0personal lawyers\u00a0before his 2024 election and was initially named White House counselor. As interim U.S. attorney, she initiated investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor and attorney general, on allegations that they were not cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Upon being named interim U.S. attorney, Habba said she'd use the office to help \"turn New Jersey red,\" though U.S. attorneys are supposed to remain politically neutral. She also filed and later dropped a criminal trespassing charge against the Newark mayor, a Democrat, and accused Democratic Rep. Monica McIver of felony assault at an immigration protest.",
      "It's not just judges, but also defendants who are challenging Habba's appointment, alleging she holds the office unlawfully. Two individuals being prosecuted by Habba's office have filed motions to dismiss their cases, arguing she illegitimately holds the position.",
      "On Friday, Sarcone's office in the Northern District of New York subpoenaed state Attorney General Letitia James as part of its investigation into whether she and her office violated Mr. Trump's civil rights in the fraud lawsuit she brought against him in 2022. He was found liable of civil fraud in February 2024, months before his re-election. Sarcone served in Mr. Trump's first administration as a regional administrator for the General Services Administration.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's offices in Northern New York, New Jersey, Nevada and California have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Sidestepping the Senate and the Judiciary",
      "Trump's administration isn't the first to exploit the acting official loophole \u2013 several administrations have relied on it in the past. In 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Vanita Gupta as acting head of the Justice Department Civil Rights Division amid the department's investigation into the Missouri shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown by a police officer. As the CATO Institute's Thomas Berry pointed out, Obama never nominated Gupta for the permanent position, but she served well beyond the 210 days allowed by the Vacancies Act. Gupta left office in January 2017, as Mr. Trump was beginning his first term.",
      "The scheme has received more attention from legal experts recently in light of the controversial nature of the four attorneys and the administration's overt push to sidestep the Senate and the judiciary.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Mr. Trump and Bondi have built a \"fantastic team\" of prosecutors with full departmental support. The spokesperson declined to comment on why the department chose to use the Vacancies Act to temporarily appoint the individuals, rather than sending them through the traditional Senate confirmation process.",
      "The Justice Department's use of the maneuver has raised the ire of several legal experts, who said they were concerned by the administration's moves to sidestep judicial authority.",
      "Michael Luttig, a former federal judge who signed onto the letter urging the rejection of Chattah's appointment, told CBS News that Mr. Trump's efforts to install U.S. attorneys without the Senate's approval are a part of a larger assault on the justice system and the rule of law.",
      "\"Every action that he's taken has been intended to harass, intimidate and threaten the federal judiciary into submission to his will,\" Luttig said.",
      "U.S. attorneys and the Vacancies Act",
      "Across the country, 93 U.S. attorneys lead the federal prosecutor's office in their judicial district. Each presidential appointee must be confirmed by the Senate to serve on a permanent basis. Confirmation can be a lengthy process, so, under the Vacancies Act, the president can temporarily appoint an individual to fill Senate-confirmed roles on an interim basis to allow agencies and offices to continue to function.",
      "The act enables the president to appoint an interim U.S. attorney to any of those positions for 120 days. If the Senate hasn't confirmed a nominee by the end of that period, judges in the corresponding federal district court may extend the interim appointee or install a candidate they choose as acting U.S. attorney for another 210 days.",
      "\"My understanding is that under prior administrations, there would be some behind-the-scenes communication to make sure that the interim U.S. attorney picked by the administration was acceptable to the District Court,\" Berry told CBS News.",
      "For three of the four contested nominees, Mr. Trump did not submit a nomination for the post to the Senate within the 120-day interim period. He nominated Habba to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey on June 30 but withdrew her nomination when it became evident that the Senate would not confirm her.",
      "In addition to Habba's rejection by the judges, also standing in the way of her ability to stay on in the office was her nomination. Under the Vacancies Act, a person may not serve as an acting officer if the president has submitted that individual's nomination to the Senate.",
      "Withdrawing Habba's nomination meant Mr. Trump could fire Grace and appoint Habba to replace her as first assistant, allowing her to assume the acting title.",
      "In New York, Sarcone reached the end of his 120-day term without a nomination pending before the Senate. When his term expired, the District Court declined to extend Sarcone, and didn't appoint anyone to the position. The Justice Department says its appointment of Sarcone as \"special attorney to the attorney general\" would confer him with the authority of a U.S. attorney and is \"indefinite.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, six of Mr. Trump's 49 interim U.S. attorneys have served the maximum 120 days allowed under that status. Andrew Boutros of the Northern District of Illinois and Joseph Murphy of the Western District of Tennessee, have also seen their interim appointments expire.",
      "In their cases, though, the District Courts voted to extend them on the 120th day, a person familiar with the decisions confirmed to CBS News.",
      "It's not clear whether the Trump administration will continue to use the maneuver to appoint other U.S. attorneys. Mr. Trump has named at least 45 interim U.S. attorneys since January and has submitted nominations to the Senate for at least 30 of those picks.",
      "In early August, the Senate approved the first two of Mr. Trump's nominees for U.S. attorneys: Jeanine Pirro to serve in the District of Columbia and Jason A. Reding Qui\u00f1ones for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that the Trump administration is \"abusing\" the interim appointment authority to install loyalist interim U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation.",

      "The State Department on Tuesday released a long-awaited series of reports on worldwide human rights practices that reveal scaled-back criticism of select countries including El Salvador and harsher assessments of traditional U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom and Germany.",
      "The release follows a period of revisions that administration officials said were meant to \"streamline\" the reports, which cover events in about 200 countries in 2024 and had been largely completed by the end of the Biden administration. A note included with the reports said they had been \"adjusted\" to be \"aligned to the administration's executive orders.\"",

They no longer include sections dedicated to systemic racial or ethnic discrimination or violence, or to child abuse or child sexual exploitation, among other deletions.",
      "Mandated by Congress, the reports have been produced annually by the State Department for decades and are used by U.S. policymakers, human rights workers, foreign governments and judicial bodies worldwide as a resource to inform potential arms sales and court proceedings, and they also function as a U.S.-led check on government corruption and abuses.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 18:43:19 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he would block the Trump administration from using a Manhattan federal building to hold immigrants facing deportation unless it improves conditions there.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday said he would block the Trump administration from using a federal building in New York City to hold immigrants facing deportation unless it reduces the number of detainees and improves conditions at the site, including by providing sleeping mats and hygiene products.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan issued the temporary restraining order after holding a hearing earlier Tuesday. A government lawyer conceded in court that those detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, at the Manhattan facility did not have access to certain services, including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication and more than two meals per day.",
      "The holding facility in question, located inside the 26 Federal Plaza building in downtown Manhattan, has been at the center of widespread criticism from pro-immigrant advocates, who have denounced conditions faced by detainees there as \"inhumane.\" Video released last month showed detainees at the facility lying on the ground, without mats or beds.",
      "ICE has said the site has fewer services because it is not designed for long-term detention, though government data indicates some detainees have been held for days there.",
      "Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates filed a lawsuit against ICE over the 26 Federal Plaza holding facility, alleging that detainees there were being held in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products. The advocates said detainees only received two \"inedible\" meals daily and were denied access to unrestricted calls with lawyers.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Oestericher said the government did not dispute that detainees at the facility only received blankets, not beds or sleeping mats. He confirmed detainees get two meals each day \u2014 not three \u2014 and that the toilets for detainees are inside the same area where they sleep. Oestericher said the facility does not permit in-person visitations due to its \"layout\" and noted the government did not dispute claims that detainees lack access to medication.",
      "In his order later Tuesday, Kaplan placed restrictions on how many people ICE can hold at the Manhattan site, prohibiting the agency from using holding rooms with a floor area that is less than 50 square feet per detainee.",
      "Kaplan said ICE could only hold people at the facility if it offered them regular calls with lawyers, clean bedding mats, know-your-rights notices, access to medication, soap, towels, toilet paper, toothpaste and feminine hygiene products. He also ordered ICE to ensure the holding areas are cleaned three times each day.",
      "Representatives for ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday's temporary restraining order, which is set to last for 14 days. The Trump administration has repeatedly denied allegations of subpar conditions at ICE detention centers.",
      "\"Today's order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,\" said Eunice Cho, a senior attorney at the ACLU.",
      "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander called the ruling \"a much-needed rebuke of Trump's cruel immigration policies\" in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Video shows conditions for detainees at 26 Federal Plaza ICE facility",
      "In July, the New York Immigration Coalition released a video, which was verified by CBS News New York, showing conditions on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza.",
      "On the video, it appears over two dozen people are being held together in one room. The person taking the video is heard saying, \"Look how they have us here like dogs.\"",
      "The room does not appear to have any furniture in it. A number of people are seen laying or sitting on towels or foil blankets on the floor. There are two toilets with sinks in the back of the room, only separated by half walls with no doors. One of the two toilets is covered with a foil blanket.",
      "The legal fight over the Manhattan holding facility comes at a time when ICE is detaining record numbers of people facing deportation. On Tuesday morning, ICE was holding nearly 60,000 detainees in detention centers throughout the U.S., according to internal agency data.",
      "As part of President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE has sought to expand its detention system by bringing new facilities online, brokering agreements with states willing to convert local sites into immigration detention centers and using military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, as deportation staging hubs.",

      "Grayson\u00a0shot and killed Massey\u00a0as she was checking on a pot of boiling water in her kitchen while saying \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" but prosecutors have said Grayson asked her to move the pot off the stove, and that she never posed a danger that justified the use of lethal force.",
      "Earlier this year, the Illinois House and Illinois Senate overwhelmingly passed the Sonya Massey Act with bipartisan support. The legislation would require more comprehensive background checks before hiring police or other law enforcement officers in Illinois.",
      "Pritzker said Tuesday that he signed the measure \"to help prevent these tragedies, to better equip law enforcement to keep our communities safe, and to continue working to build a justice system that protects all of our citizens.\"",
      "The new law requires local, county, and state law enforcement agencies statewide to conduct full background checks on a potential hire before offering them a badge and gun.",
      "The measure also prohibits law enforcement agencies from making a final job offer unless they've reviewed all of an applicant's prior employment records.",
      "Anyone applying for a police officer job in Illinois would be required to authorize all previous employers, including other law enforcement agencies, to provide full employment records \u2013 including \"duty-related physical and psychological fitness-for-duty examinations; work performance records,\" and any criminal records or records of other investigations connected to their conduct on the job.",
      "\"Officers with histories of serious disciplinary issues should not be serving in those capacities in our communities, and those histories should not come to light only after disaster happens,\" Pritzker said. \"Our justice system needs to be built on trust. Communities should be able to trust that when they call the police to their home, the responding officer will be well-trained and without a history bias or misconduct. And police officers should be able to trust that they are serving alongside responsible and capable individuals.\"",
      "Massey's family has said they hope this new law will become a model for other states.",
      "\"Thank you for your support and God bless you,\" her mother, Donna Massey, said after the governor signed the legislation.",
      "Before Grayson was hired in Sangamon County and went on to kill Massey,\u00a0questions about his conduct\u00a0were well-documented by other police agencies. But those concerns were somehow never shared with the Sangamon County Sheriff's office during the hiring process.",
      "In his fifth police job, he refused to terminate a high-speed chase and drove more than 110 mph \u2014 only coming to an end when he hit a deer. A report from a department where Grayson was employed also said he struggled with report writing and was aggressive in his pursuit for drugs.",
      "Grayson is\u00a0scheduled to go on trial for Massey's death in October\u00a0in Peoria County. The Illinois Supreme Court is\u00a0weighing a request from Grayson to be released from jail ahead of his murder trial.",

    "summary": "The White House says it will review some of the best-known Smithsonian museums to root out \"divisive or ideologically driven language.\"",
    "story": [
      "The White House is launching an internal review of some of the Smithsonian Institution's best-known museums, seeking to \"celebrate American exceptionalism\" and remove what it views as \"divisive or ideologically driven language.\"",
      "The review was announced in a letter Tuesday to Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution Lonnie Bunch, signed by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and two other White House aides. It comes after President Trump signed an executive order in March pushing for changes at the Smithsonian, including the removal of \"improper ideology.\"",
      "The review is timed with next year's celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the letter said.",
      "\"This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\" the White House's letter read.",
      "The administration's review will initially focus on eight museums, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2014 which was highlighted in Mr. Trump's executive order for allegedly featuring \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" \u2014 as well as the Air and Space Museum, the Museum of American History and the National Portrait Gallery, among others. Additional museums will be reviewed in a future phase.",
      "The letter said the reviewers will look at content for exhibits, plans for future exhibitions, collections and internal processes used by the museum's curators. It requested that museums start sending over some information in the next 30 days.",
      "Within 120 days, the White House said museums should start making \"content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.\"",
      "The Smithsonian said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Smithsonian's work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents.\"",
      "The letter called the review a \"collaborative\" effort that \"empowers museum staff.\"",
      "\"Our goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive portrayals of America's heritage,\" the White House wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to reshape the Smithsonian and other U.S. cultural institutions during his second term to combat what he sees as ideological bias \u2014 assuming a more active role than prior presidents.",
      "His March executive order directed Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents \u2014 to work to review Smithsonian museums, including by \"seeking to remove improper ideology.\" It claimed some of the institution's museums have \"promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\"",
      "The order drew condemnation from Democrats. The four Democratic members of the House Administration Committee penned an open letter calling the moves \"cowardly and unpatriotic\" and saying Mr. Trump's order would undermine the Smithsonian's independence.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we now stand at the brink of seeing the Smithsonian at its worst: shaped solely by the views and ideology of one individual as a means of expanding his political power,\" the letter said.",
      "Late last month, the Washington Post reported that the National Museum of American History had removed references to Mr. Trump's two impeachments. The Smithsonian later said it would update the exhibit to reflect all impeachment proceedings in U.S. history, calling the placard that was removed \"temporary\" and saying it \"did not meet the museum's standards.\" The Smithsonian said it wasn't asked by the Trump administration to remove anything.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would fire the director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in May, calling her a \"highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI.\" The Smithsonian later put out a statement noting its independence and asserting that only Bunch \u2014 who has served as secretary of the Smithsonian since 2019 \u2014 can make personnel decisions. The director later resigned, the New York Times and Washington Post reported.",
      "Meanwhile, the president pushed out the leadership of the Kennedy Center, prompting some artists to cancel planned performances.",

    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner. But that's become more challenging as fewer people and institutions respond to surveys, experts say.",

    "summary": "Three officials involved in President Trump's controversial L.A. National Guard deployment testified in court Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Three officials involved in President Trump's controversial deployment of National Guard troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles testified Monday as the trial in California Gov. Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration began.",
      "The question at issue is whether the military forces sent in by Mr. Trump \u2014 including members of the Marine Corps and National Guard \u2014 violated the 19th century Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from enforcing domestic laws.",
      "Newsom called the deployment of around 4,000 California National Guard troops, who normally are under the governor's command, an illegal \"power grab.\" But Mr. Trump argued the move was legal and necessary to protect immigration agents and federal property during tense protests against operations by ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump's early June executive order calling up the Guard said the protests \"constitute a form of rebellion.\" And the administration has justified the deployment using a law called Title 10 that allows the president to call up Guard forces during a \"rebellion\" or \"invasion,\" or if he is unable \"with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "In one notable moment during Monday's testimony, Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman \u2014 who at one point was deployed as the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 said he never heard the term \"rebellion\" used to describe the situation in the nation's second-largest city.",
      "San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer is overseeing the three-day trial. Breyer had previously ruled in June that Mr. Trump's deployment was likely illegal. An appellate court overturned that ruling, saying the president should be given deference to decide whether Title 10 applies, and that Mr. Trump had some basis to say that violence during the protests had prevented federal officers from enforcing the law. The appellate judges didn't weigh in on whether the protests constituted a rebellion, which they said wasn't necessary for the deployment to be legal.",
      "The dispute gained new resonance on Monday, after Mr. Trump announced National Guard forces would be deployed in Washington, D.C., to assist with police. Unlike in California, the D.C. National Guard reports to the president.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Guard forces will not be involved in law enforcement in the nation's capital, but they can briefly detain people if necessary and hand them over to police.",
      "Officials testify about military's role amid L.A. protests",
      "Military officials said their mission was to protect federal facilities and federal personnel, and \"to support federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Sherman testified that the military could be sent whenever local law enforcement carried out an operation, even if there were no physical threats and no protesters were breaking the law.",
      "The comments surprised Breyer, who pressed him on the claim, asking: \"So if there's no threat you can send out the military?\" Sherman affirmed that whenever local law enforcement was carrying out an operation, the military could be sent out, explaining that a threat could develop even if no active threat was assessed.",
      "\"Wouldn't that always be the case?\" Breyer responded.",
      "But Sherman said he had withheld support for one operation. He testified that a DHS official questioned his \"loyalty\" to his country for objecting to the request for military assistance with an immigration enforcement operation at MacArthur Park. He said he had assessed that there was a low risk to federal agents on that occasion.",
      "The operation, which took place on July 7, featured horse-mounted officers and military Humvees and drew national attention.",
      "William Harrington, deputy chief of staff for the Los Angeles military deployment's task force, testified that he understood the federalized National Guard troops could not engage in civil enforcement activities, and everybody knew the Posse Comitatus Act applied. He said task force members responded to requests for assistance from federal law enforcement agencies. These included protecting federal buildings and force protection for federal agents who were executing functions such as search warrant operations.",
      "Ernesto Santacruz Jr., a field office director for the Department of Homeland Security, testified Monday that assaults on agents from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division reduced drastically once the National Guard was there. He said that there had been daily attacks on officers before the deployment.",
      "Santacruz testified that the National Guard troops were there \"to assist and protect federal authorities.\" He did not know of any denials of requests for assistance.",
      "When asked about the law this trial centers on, the Posse Comitatus Act, Santacruz did not have any knowledge of what it allowed or prohibited.",
      "At its peak in June, nearly 5,000 service members were deployed to the Los Angeles area: some 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines. The vast majority of Guard forces have been returned to California, though about 300 remain under federal control.",
      "As of Sunday night, the remaining Guard forces were still guarding a courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles and a facility in Paramount, California, Sherman testified.",
      "The trial will continue on Tuesday, when the federal government will call Sherman back to the stand. On Wednesday, the court is set to hear several legal issues raised by the government, including that California lacks standing to sue."

      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He's defended Mr. Trump's economic policy moves in the past, including the president's tariff strategy. He has also\u00a0criticized the BLS\u00a0for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",

      "After failing to reach a quorum in the Texas House on Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed what Republican lawmakers have been saying \u2014 that beyond efforts to add five GOP congressional seats in the Lone Star State, there have been discussions about seeking to add as many as three more.",
      "In an exclusive interview with CBS News Texas Monday, Governor Abbott said, \"What we are doing is looking at all options. We're looking at a lot of different alternatives in part to make sure we do have fairness. If you compare Texas to California or Illinois or New York or Massachusetts, those states are truly gerrymandered and have hardly any Republicans.\"",
      "When asked if Texas has also gerrymandered districts, the Governor said, \"Well, no, there's a higher percentage of Democrats in Texas than in the Congressional delegation than there are Republicans in California, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts. So if Texas were to draw its maps the way the Democratic states have drawn their maps it could means as maybe a ten seat pick-up.\"",
      "Of California's 52 Congressional seats, Republicans serve in just nine. In Illinois, only 3 of the state's 17 Congressional districts are served by Republicans. In Texas, Democrats hold 13 of the state's 38 Congressional seats.",
      "Abbott calls out Democrats",
      "The Governor called out Texas Democrats who continue to break quorum and prevent the House from voting on the new Congressional maps favoring Republicans.\u00a0 Last week, Abbott filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court to remove House Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu, who led Democrats on their out-of-state quorum break.",
      "Democrats have said they're doing what their constituents want them to do and point to the Supreme Court's opinion four years ago that said the Texas Constitution enables them to break quorum. When asked why that isn't an adequate defense for the Democrats, Abbott said, \"An interstate highway enables you to go to 100 miles per hour but doesn't authorize it. It's against the law. Same thing here. Even though the Constitution enables Democrats to break quorum, the Constitution does not authorize them to do this. In fact the Constitution does the exact opposite. It requires them to show up and cast votes on bills.\"",
      "When asked if the Constitution needs to be changed because it doesn't explicitly ban breaking quorum, or if he thought winning the lawsuit would resolve this, Abbott said \"If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the lawsuit that I filed, it will end quorum breaking. They did not think of at the time they wrote the Constitution that people would not show up and do their job.\"",
      "Removing Democrats from their seats",
      "On Monday, the Supreme Court released an expedited schedule for both the Governor and Representative Wu to file their legal briefs. Deadlines extend to September 4.",
      "Democratic lawmakers who have been at the Capitol and who have broken quorum and are out of state criticized the Governor and Republicans. Democratic Representative Eddie Morales or Eagle Pass told CBS News Texas Monday, \"I would say that the last 30 years of a Republican controlled statewide office from top down has put us in the situation that we're in, that they're failing 100% and making sure that all Texans are being represented well, that they're playing this political theater and these political games.\"",
      "Representative Ramon Romero, Jr., D-Fort Worth, who also serves as Chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus told CBS News Texas Monday that he believes Republicans will lose the House in next year's midterm elections. \"They are preparing for huge losses in 2026, and that's why they have to do this at the expense of Latino voices that have been in Congress for a long time and have had overwhelming support from their communities. That's what's really happening.\"",
      "Democrats have vowed to stay away for the rest of the special session which ends August 19th. When asked if he will start the second special session on that same day, the Governor said he will.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement it will maintain a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he is deploying members of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and that the federal government has taken control of the D.C. police as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House. \"This is liberation day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back.\"",
      "Flanked by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel, Mr. Trump said he was officially enforcing Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 and placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department \"under direct federal control.\" He said Bondi was taking control of the department immediately under a public safety emergency. A White House official later said the arrangement is expected to last 30 days, the maximum amount of time allowed under the law without action from Congress.",
      "\"In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later that about 800 guardsmen would be called up.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" In an accompanying executive order, Mr. Trump wrote that the deployment \"shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023, according to local police data. So far this year, robberies have dropped by 28% and overall violent crime is down 26%, as of Aug. 11. Last year, violent crime in the capital city hit its lowest level in more than 30 years, the Justice Department said.",
      "The president criticized what he called \"phony numbers\" on crime in D.C., saying the administration would \"look into that.\" And he said the crime issue \"directly impacts the functioning of the federal government and is a threat to America, really.\"",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're not going to lose our cities over this.\"",
      "The president said the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and \"we're going to clean it up real quick.\"",
      "\"It's becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness,\" the president added. He called it \"embarrassing\" for him to be \"up here talking about how unsafe and dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was,\" ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.",
      "The president cited a number of high-profile crimes, including the alleged assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer last week, who the president said was \"savagely beaten by a band of roving thugs after defending a young woman from an attempted carjacking.\" Shortly after the incident, the White House announced that it had boosted the presence of federal law enforcement in the district, as Mr. Trump threatened a federal takeover of the city.",
      "Mr. Trump said a process had begun over the weekend to remove homeless encampments in the district. He noted that the Metropolitan Police Department and federal authorities would be supported by the 800 D.C. National Guardsmen and potentially \"much more.\"",
      "\"If necessary, we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the district, the president determined that \"special conditions of an emergency nature exist\" that require the use of the MPD for federal purposes, including maintaining law and order, protecting federal buildings, monuments and other federal property and ensuring the \"conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.\" The executive order directs the D.C. mayor to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\"",
      "The law allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for a period of 48 hours, a deadline that can be extended by notifying Congress about the takeover and how much longer it is likely to continue. A House Oversight Committee spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the panel had been notified by the president of the extension beyond 48 hours. The statute says the president can control the police department for up to 30 days, \"unless the Senate and the House of Representatives enact into law a joint resolution authorizing such an extension.\"",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that \"we will follow the law\" and comply with the president's order. She said she hopes to meet with Bondi soon, and noted that the D.C. police chief remains in operational control of the MPD.",
      "\"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,\" Bowser said at a news conference later in the day. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"",
      "The moves come after the administration deployed about 450 federal law enforcement officers from a number of agencies across D.C. overnight Sunday. The president pledged in a social media post Sunday that he would \"make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.\"",
      "\"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong. It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border.\"",
      "The president previously deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles amid heated protests over immigration raids in June. Mr. Trump also deployed the National Guard in June 2020 to D.C. to quell protests after the death of George Floyd.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing a \"D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force.\" He has said violent crime must be stopped in the district, claiming that it \"has become one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.\"",
      "Bowser pushed back on the characterization of crime in the district, noting on Monday that violent crime is down following a well-documented spike in violence in 2023 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We have been able to reverse that 2023 crime spike. This year, crime isn't just down from 2023. It's also down from 2019, before the pandemic, and we're at a 30-year violent crime low,\" she said. \"We're not satisfied. We haven't taken our foot off the gas. And we continue to look for ways to make our cities safer.\"",
      "The mayor told MSNBC on Sunday that she has talked with Mr. Trump \"repeatedly\" about crime and that \"the president is very aware of our efforts.\" Bowser acknowledged that \"the D.C. National Guard is the president's National Guard, so that's always his prerogative.\" And she noted that \"federal law enforcement is always on the street in D.C. and we always work cooperatively with them.\"",
      "In another post later Sunday, the president said Bowser \"is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive.\"",
      "Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents the district in a nonvoting seat in the House, said Mr. Trump's move to federalize D.C. police is a \"historic assault on D.C. home rule,\" calling it a \"counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. residents.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, saying there is nothing in the grand jury record that would shed new light on the case.",
      "Judge Paul Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the Justice Department's bid to unveil the material in a 31-page order Monday morning. In court filings, Justice Department lawyers argued the circumstances of the Maxwell case warranted the release of the grand jury transcripts and exhibits, which typically remain secret. Engelmayer rejected that argument.",
      "\"The Government's invocation of special circumstances, however, fails at the threshold,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"Its entire premise \u2014 that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them \u2014 is demonstrably false.\"",
      "\"The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor,\" Engelmayer said. \"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes. They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation.\"",
      "He said anyone \"who reviewed these materials expecting, based on the Government's representations, to learn new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed and misled. There is no 'there' there.\"",
      "In July, the Justice Department asked the judges overseeing the Maxwell and Epstein cases to release the grand jury material that formed the basis for the federal charges against them, a move that came amid uproar over the department's review of the so-called \"Epstein files\" and decision not to release additional documents in the government's possession. The basis for the Justice Department's request was, as Engelmayer noted, that the grand jury documents \"contain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the investigation into them.\"",
      "But he pointed out that these grand juries had not been used for any investigative purpose, but rather had only been convened to return an indictment. He said no victim, eyewitness or suspect testified. Each of the two grand juries \"received evidence on a single day,\" hearing only from a single person, a summary witness who \"testified to information obtained in the Government's investigation to support the charges in the proposed indictment.\"",
      "Englemayer suggested that if the case were unsealed, a \"member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion \u2014 aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Maxwell's legal team for comment. Maxwell is continuing to contest her 2021 conviction.",
      "Her attorneys argued against the Justice Department's attempt to unseal the testimony and exhibits, writing that their client had \"no choice but to respectfully oppose\" the release.",
      "In numerous court filings leading up to Engelmayer's decision, the Justice Department acknowledged that the grand jury transcripts, containing testimony from only two law enforcement officials, were mostly already made public during Epstein and Maxwell's court proceedings.",
      "Engelmayer wrote that after a court review of the grand jury material, he found the release would \"not reveal new information of any consequence.\"",
      "\"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation.\"",
      "\"Insofar as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine lode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are not that,\" Engelmayer continued, criticizing the Trump administration's justification for unsealing the documents as \"disingenuous.\"",
      "\"A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion \u2014 aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,\" he wrote.",

Mr. Trump also made gains among Latino voters.",

Texas state Democrats recently fled the state to protest a new congressional map that could increase the number of GOP seats.

      "Republican lawmakers in Texas have opened a new front in their efforts to crack down on abortion, this time with a bill that would enable lawsuits targeting the use of medication to terminate pregnancies. Their proposal would also take aim at shield laws in other states that protect manufacturers and the doctors who prescribe abortion pills.",
      "In Texas, it is already illegal to knowingly mail, carry or deliver abortion-inducing drugs. It is also illegal for a doctor not licensed in the state of Texas to prescribe abortion medication.",
      "Now, in the midst of an already controversial special legislative session, lawmakers have reintroduced a bill that would allow lawsuits to target anyone who manufactures, mails, delivers, prescribes or distributes abortion pills. The bill would also permit people to file a wrongful death lawsuit if the medication results in harm or death of a fetus or the mother, within a statute of limitations up to six years.",
      "\"These are the pills that are being mailed into Texas directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without follow-up care after,\" the bill's sponsor, Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican, told the Texas Tribune earlier this year. \"This is illegal in Texas, but is taking place, and we've thus far not been able to protect women.\"",
      "The World Health Organization says the pills \u2014 a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 can be safely prescribed for women to self-administer at home, without the direct supervision of a health care provider, in the first trimester.",
      "Hughes previously sponsored a state law, passed in 2021, banning abortions at six weeks, or when a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected.",

      "Similar to the proposed legislation, this lawsuit targets shield laws in other states meant to protect physicians who provided the abortion pills in the plaintiff's case. The lawsuit is filed in federal court and names a nonprofit group that the plaintiff claims helped the father obtain medication, Aid Access, which is based in the Netherlands.",

      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced.

    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",

A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",

      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",

      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up.

    "story": [
      "Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded the famous Apollo 13 mission, has died, NASA announced Friday. He was 97.",
      "Apollo 13, a 1970 flight to the moon, became known as a \"successful failure\" after the spacecraft experienced an oxygen tank explosion thousands of miles from Earth but managed to safely return home.",
      "Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement that Lovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois. Duffy praised Lovell's life and work, saying he inspired millions of people.",
      "\"Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,\" Duffy said.",
      "Lovell was the command module pilot for 1968's Apollo 8 mission, the first to carry humans to the moon and back, though it did not land on the lunar surface.",
      "Andrew Chaikin, author of the 2007 book \"A Man on the Moon\" on the Apollo program, told CBS News that Lovell had some of the most memorable comments during the Apollo 8 TV transmissions. He recalled that Lovell called Earth a \"grand oasis in the vastness of space.\"",
      "\"Lovell had imagination, there was a part of Lovell that was about imagination, and that was a neat part of him,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Apollo 8 circled the moon 10 times and sent back the famous \"Earthrise\" photo of our world from space. Lovell reflected on that journey 50 years later in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"Sometimes I look back and say, you know, 'How did we ever do that?\" he said.",
      "In 1970, Lovell had a chance to go back to the moon with Apollo 13, with crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, but the mission abruptly changed with the explosion.",
      "\"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Swigert reported to mission control.\u00a0Moments later, Lovell repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"",
      "The mishap forced Lovell, his crewmates and NASA's team on the ground to turn all their efforts toward returning to Earth safely.",
      "\"His calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\" Duffy said of Lovell.",
      "Lovell graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and went on to become a naval aviator, including a four-year tour at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Chaikin said Lovell demonstrated his skills as a test pilot during Apollo 13.",
      "\"He always said that the true measure of a test pilot is not whether you can do the mission you're assigned, but when things don't go right, how you respond,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Chaikin described Lovell as being calm and unflappable throughout the crisis, but he recalled one moment when Lovell started to seem irritable.",
      "\"He's been without sleep, and he's worried about his crew and says, like, 'You're going to have to figure out this checklist because we've got to get some sleep,'\" Chaikin said. \"That's like the only time in the whole mission when he even starts to show anything but calm, unflappable Lovell.\"",
      "Actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" which was nominated for best picture at the Oscars.",
      "In an Instagram post Friday evening, Hanks wrote that Lovell's \"many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2014 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2014 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\"",
      "Before the movie was released, Chaikin said Lovell told him that the true story of Apollo 13 had never been told.",
      "\"That's how he felt,\" Chaikin said. \"Of course, everything changed when Ron Howard made that movie, to the point that Jim became probably the best known Apollo astronaut next to Neil Armstrong. But before that movie happened, he really felt that way.\"",
      "NASA shared a statement from Lovell's family: \"We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\"",

      "NASA and the European Space Agency released the latest photos Thursday.",
      "Discovered last month by a telescope in Chile, the comet known as 3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass our way and poses no threat to Earth.",
      "Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles across, but Hubble's observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles. It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"All three appear to be quite dark and red, reflecting only about 5% of the sunlight that hits them, which is similar in reflectivity to asphalt,\" the observatory said last month. \"Unlike 1I/'Oumuamu, 3I does not change much in brightness as it rotates, indicating that it is more likely to be spherical.\"",

    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

      "Eastman said his goal was \"to make the camera as convenient as the pencil,\" according to the Kodak website.",

      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",

      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",
      "The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.",
      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",

      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions.

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

    "story": [
      "Sections of Alaska's capital city are bracing for the arrival of what could be record floodwaters due to rainwater and snowmelt flowing downstream from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier.",
      "Some Juneau residents in the flood zone have evacuated, heeding warnings, and officials there intensified their warnings Tuesday, saying \"Don't wait, Evacuate TONIGHT.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, authorities confirmed water had started escaping the ice dam, with flooding expected into Wednesday.",
      "The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles from Juneau, home to 30,000 people, and is a popular tourist attraction due to its proximity to Alaska's capital city and easy access on walking trails. Homes on the city's outskirts are within miles of Mendenhall Lake, which sits below the glacier, and many front the Mendenhall River, into which the glacial outburst is flowing.",
      "The National Weather Service said it expected flooding to to peak around 8 a.m. to noon local time (noon - 4 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. Later, the NWS said the peak was probably going to occur closer to 8 a.m. local time.",
      "\"This will be a new record, based on all of the information that we have,\" Nicole Ferrin, a weather service meteorologist, told a news conference Tuesday.",
      "Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. Government agencies installed temporary barriers this year in hopes of protecting several hundred homes in the inundation area from widespread damage.",
      "The flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier retreated \u2014 a casualty of the warming climate \u2014 and left a basin, known as Suicide Basin, that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier, enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually flows down the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday.",
      "Before the basin began overtopping, the water level was rising rapidly - as much as 4 feet per day, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The city saw successive years of record flooding in 2023 and 2024 \u2014 with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet, about a foot over the prior record set a year earlier \u2014 and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. This year's flooding was predicted to crest at between 16.3 and 16.8 feet, the weather service said, but then said an even higher 16.75 feet was more likely.",
      "Last year, nearly 300 residences were damaged.",
      "Video posted on social media\u00a0two years ago showed towering trees behind a home falling into the rushing Mendenhall River as the water ate away at the bank. Eventually, the home, teetering at the edge, also collapsed into the river.",
      "A large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. That's the equivalent of nearly 23,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. During last year's flood, the flow rate in the rushing Mendenhall River was about half that of Niagara Falls, the researchers say.",
      "City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The 10,000 \"Hesco\" barriers are essentially giant sandbags intended to protect more than 460 properties completely during an 18-foot flood event, said emergency manager Ryan O'Shaughnessy.",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what's expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution, such as a levee. The timeline has angered some residents, who say it's unreasonable.",
      "Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.",

      "Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States Tuesday in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks smuggling drugs across the border.",
      "Those handed over to U.S. custody include Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, a leader of \"Los Cuinis,\" a group closely aligned with notorious cartel Jalisco New Generation, or CJNG. Another defendant, Roberto Salazar, is wanted in connection to the 2008 killing of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. Other prominent figures have ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and other violent drug trafficking groups.",
      "The transfers are a milestone for the Trump administration, which has made dismantling dangerous drug cartels a key Justice Department priority. It's the second time in months that Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs onto American streets.",
      "\"These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores \u2014 under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"We are grateful to Mexico's National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.\"",
      "In February, President Trump signed an executive order designating CJNG, Sinaloa and six other cartels \u2014 Tren de Aragua, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), C\u00e1rtel del Noreste (formerly Los Zetas), La Nueva Familia Michoacana, C\u00e1rtel de Golfo (Gulf Cartel), and C\u00e1rteles Unidos \u2014 as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The cartel figures were put on planes to the U.S. after the Justice Department agreed not to seek the death penalty against any of the defendants or against any cartel leaders and members sent to the U.S. in February. That transfer was of 29 cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985.",
      "\"This transfer is yet another example of what is possible when two governments stand united against violence and impunity,\" U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said in a statement. \"These fugitives will now face justice in U.S. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.\"",
      "The February transfers came as Mexican officials were trying to head off the Trump administration's threat of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports. Late last month, President Trump spoke with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and agreed to put off threatened 30% tariffs for another 90 days to allow for negotiations.",
      "Sheinbaum has shown a willingness to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Last week, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump directed the military to target drug cartels in Latin America. Sheinbaum responded Friday by saying there would be \"no invasion of Mexico.\"",
      "Also included in the group expelled Tuesday was Servando G\u00f3mez Martinez, also known as \"La Tuta,\" a former school teacher who became one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords as head of the Knights Templar cartel. He was captured in 2015 and sentenced to 55 years in a Mexican prison in June 2019.",
      "Gomez led the quasi-religious criminal group that once exercised absolute control over Michoacan and he liked to appear in interviews and videos. The cartel orchestrated politics, controlled commerce, dictated rules and preached a code of ethics around devotion to God and family, even as it murdered and plundered.",
      "Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia is the brother-in-law of CJNG leader Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, a top target of the U.S. government. Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia was arrested in February 2015 in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco and had been fighting extradition to the United States since then. The U.S. government has offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to \"El Mencho's\" arrest or conviction.",

    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump is calling up the D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement to address crime in the capital.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced this week the deployment of 800 members of the D.C. National Guard to the District of Columbia, as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "The president is also temporarily taking control of the District's Metropolitan Police Department. Hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers have also joined the effort recently, from a variety of agencies fanning out across the city.",
      "\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference Monday.",
      "The Army has activated the D.C. National Guard to \"assist law enforcement in the nation's capital,\" it said in a statement and added that of the approximately 800 soldiers activated, 100 to 200 would be supporting law enforcement at any given time on an \"array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in the District.",
      "What is the National Guard doing in D.C.?",
      "The District of Columbia is unique in that it's controlled by the federal government, which means the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard.",
      "For now, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Guard members will be supporting federal agents, as they recently did in Los Angeles, when they were brought in after protests against Trump administration immigration policies to help protect federal property and personnel enforcing the policies.",
      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude. But they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.\"",
      "He elaborated on how they might be utilized, saying, \"You can help somebody, interdict, temporarily detain like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement.\"",
      "And Hegseth also said the Guard members in D.C. are \"going to be proactive.\"",
      "\"If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\" he told Ingraham.",
      "The Army on Tuesday posted photos of the National Guard near the Washington Monument on X with the comment, \"D.C. National Guard reporting for duty.\"\u00a0Some of the vehicles\u00a0appeared to belong to the D.C. National Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, which often helps with security for high-profile D.C. events like presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations, the unit's website says.",
      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Before they're sent to the D.C. streets, the service members will receive additional training on de-escalation tactics and rules for the use of force, according to defense officials.",
      "Hegseth said Monday at the White House that other guardsmen from other states and other \"specialized units\" are prepared to deploy to D.C. if needed.",
      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",
      "Before Mr. Trump's announcement Monday, the White House was already deploying federal law enforcement officers onto D.C. streets as a part of an effort to make the city cleaner and safer.",
      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",
      "James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 21:42:49 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC Director Susan Monarez held an all-hands meeting as staff remain shaken by the shooting rampage targeting the agency's headquarters in Atlanta.",
    "story": [
      "Four days after a gunman riddled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's main campus in Atlanta with bullets, CDC employees say they are still looking for steady leadership and clear communication. The agency's first all-hands meeting since the attack ran roughly 12 minutes, began late and was beset by technical problems, according to staff who tried to watch.",
      "In Tuesday's all-hands, new CDC Director Susan Monarez described the shooting as \"an attack in our community \u2026 and in many ways the very mission that we serve.\" She warned that \"misinformation can be dangerous \u2026 we need to rebuild the trust together,\" urging \"rational, evidence-based discourse \u2026 with compassion and understanding.\"",
      "CDC security chief Jeff Williams told staff investigators view the incident as \"a targeted attack on the CDC related to COVID-19.\" He said agency security \"stopped\" an intrusion that could have resulted in many more casualties, that nearly 100 children at the childcare center were reunited with parents that night, and that investigators recovered nearly 500 shell casings. More than 180 rounds struck six buildings, leaving extensive damage that will take time to repair.",
      "Monarez closed the meeting by honoring fallen DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and pointing staff to a CDC Foundation fund for his family.",
      "In April, more than 200 staff were fired from the CDC's Injury Prevention Center. In the aftermath of Friday's shooting, several CDC employees noted the grim irony: the team charged with studying how to prevent firearm violence had been dismissed.",
      "One employee who spoke with CBS News on background, because they were not authorized to comment publicly, described Monarez's remarks as \"heavily scripted.\" Another staffer said, \"Monarez is new and doesn't know the agency, but she could have brought in career leaders \u2026 to show that she's working hand in hand with experienced CDC leaders. It feels like most of the CDC community is really trying to unify and support each other.\" A union message referred to the meeting, which lasted from 11:12 a.m. to 11:24 a.m., as \"insultingly insufficient,\" and invited workers to a noon healing session.",
      "\"Dr. Monarez and CDC leadership remain focused on supporting staff during an extraordinarily difficult time as evidenced by their continued direct engagement,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News. \"Friday's shooting was a traumatic event for the agency, and leadership is working to provide continued updates along with resources for healing and recovery. There will be continued opportunities for staff engagement and dialogue in the days ahead.\"",
      "Several employees praised separate Saturday and Tuesday calls for the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, led by Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, describing them as \"validating,\" with clear next steps and mental-health resources. Monarez joined the Saturday call and \"was more natural and less scripted,\" a staffer said.",
      "On Tuesday, Daskalakis told staff, \"We've experienced a horrific and intentionally targeted attack \u2026 we're shocked, we're grieving, we're scared,\" and he urged teams to use the space to speak frankly. He emphasized that CDC would take \"time and space before we come back,\" noting the investigation is \"complex and ongoing.\"",
      "The meeting centered on mental health and resources to support traumatized staffers. Daskalakis introduced Dr. David Schonfeld of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, who walked through common post-crisis reactions.",
      "\"Most people try and hide their distress,\" he said, encouraging employees to seek support rather than suppress their feelings. Trying to do so, he added, \"is not a superpower.\"",
      "Daskalakis noted reports that the suspect was angry about COVID-19 vaccines and influenced by conspiracy theories. \"This is not our fault,\" he said. \"Our work is love and what we experienced is hate.\"",
      "Many of the CDC's centers are currently led by acting directors, after several center directors were reassigned to the Indian Health Service earlier this year.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the CDC's campus on Monday, three days after the attack, while most staff were instructed by leadership to telework due to safety concerns and the ongoing assessments following the shootings. On the same day that he visited the CDC, Kennedy gave an interview to Scripps News in which he once again raised questions about vaccine safety, drawing sharp criticism from some CDC staff, who argued that anti-vaccine rhetoric, including from Kennedy, helped create the conditions for the attack.",
      "HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon told CBS News, \"This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce and we hope the media will respect the moment rather than exploiting a tragedy and further exacerbating an already harrowing experience by the dedicated CDC staff.\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"Violence has no place in any civil society, and the White House extends our heartfelt condolences to the family of Officer David Rose and the entire CDC team.\"",

      "\"I started to get chills, feverish, my leg was swelling, burning,\" the third-generation sponge fisherman told CBS News.",
      "Billiris was wading in the water while fishing with his grandson back in July 2019 when he contracted the bacteria, which got into his system through a cut he had on his back leg. It was \"just a little tiny scab,\" Billiris said.",
      "At the hospital, doctors used a marker on his leg to track the spread of the bacteria. After three weeks of treatment, the infection subsided, saving his leg from amputation.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in five people who contract the bacteria die\u00a0after rapid spread of the infection.",
      "During\u00a0hurricane season, the danger of contracting Vibrio vulnificus heightens, according to Dr. Valerie Harwood, a microbiologist at the University of South Florida.\u00a0Research also shows the ocean's water temperature is rising due to climate change, which leads to more frequent and severe storms.",
      "Harwood said that because the bacteria thrives in warmer waters, it means more infections are seen in places that haven't experienced them before as water temperatures rise in those regions.",
      "\"With warming waters, we are seeing cases further north,\" Harwood said.",
      "In recent years, cases have been reported in the Carolinas, and even as far north as Connecticut and New York. This year, there have been 17 cases in Louisiana, 16 in Florida and seven in North Carolina. Florida has reported five deaths so far, the most of any state.",
      "The bacteria can also spread through uncooked seafood, mainly oysters.",
      "These days, Billiris says he is more cautious in the water, but he still sails his family's boat nearly every day. He hopes others will recognize the symptoms of an infection, because earlier treatment could mean the difference between life and death.",

      "The budget carrier had warned it has \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to sustain operations. The cautionary report comes just months after Spirit emerged from\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
      "In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to \"adverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",
      "That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year \u2014 among other challenges and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida-based company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "More Americans are cutting back on travel this year because of economic worries, according to a recent LendingTree study.",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its looming debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",

      "The U.S. stock market is rallying toward records on Tuesday after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",
      "The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They're betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",

It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",

      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",
      "FactSet gives an 88% probability of a rate cut at the meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

      "The peaches harvested at Masumoto Family Farm in California's Central Valley are so delicious, they are sought after by world-famous restaurants.",
      "But this year's harvest signals trouble: There are 30% fewer peaches to pick due to warmer winters that disrupted the sleep cycles of the trees. Farmers like Mas Masumoto, whose family relies on a 12-week peach harvest for their entire income, are seeing firsthand how climate change\u00a0threatens their livelihood.",
      "\"We like to think about it like the trees need to sleep really soundly \u2014 and they need a certain number of hours under 45 degrees,\" Mas' daughter Nikiko said.",
      "This past winter, the area's stone fruits, such as peaches, plums, apricots and cherries, didn't get consistent cold weather that regulates the trees' nutrients. Instead, they were interrupted by many warmer days, which could explain why growers have been hit hard.",
      "\"Some of them actually didn't have a crop at all,\" said Raymond Mireles, an agriculture adviser with the University of California. \"And so ultimately, you know, as these trees get woken up, these trees weren't able to kind of maintain some of their carbohydrates within the roots, and ultimately they don't know when to wake up.\"",
      "Much like a person needs a full night's sleep to be productive, the trees need a full winter's sleep. Now, stone fruit lovers across the country may be beginning to feel the impact. Consumers are paying 23 cents more a pound for yellow peaches and 17 cents more for white peaches.",
      "The Masumotos say one of their oldest groves at the farm helped save the day. Mas Masumoto remembers helping plant it with his parents 60 years ago after they were released from a Japanese internment camp. They also passed down old methods of irrigation.",
      "\"We still use this old system of furrow irrigating, most modern agriculture is using drip irrigation, which only keeps the one plant alive,\" Masumoto said. \"My theory, our theory, is the idea of keeping the soil alive. And I think as our trees have deep roots, they tolerate these swings in temperature and change in climate.\"",
      "The older trees \u2014 and old ways \u2014 are helping this one family pack and ship 10,000 pieces of fruit a day. But other farmers and lovers of fresh California fruits may not be so lucky in the future.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:57:28 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has installed four U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation, prompting questions about checks on executive power.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in several states have rejected President Trump's controversial picks for top prosecutor posts in a rare standoff between the courts and the White House, but those acting U.S. attorneys will nonetheless remain in place because of actions taken by the president and the Justice Department.",
      "Last month in New York and New Jersey, panels of federal district judges declined to appoint two of Mr. Trump's interim choices to serve as U.S. attorneys \u2013 John Sarcone III of New York and Alina Habba of New Jersey. By law, if the Senate fails to confirm a nominee for a judicial post within 120 days, the District Court can extend the interim appointee or select someone else to serve in an acting capacity until a presidential nominee is confirmed.",
      "In New York, the court declined to extend the interim top prosecutor but also declined to appoint an acting U.S. attorney.",
      "In New Jersey, a panel of judges replaced Habba with Desiree Leigh Grace, the first assistant to the U.S. attorney and the next-highest ranking prosecutor in that office. Within hours, however, the Justice Department fired Grace and installed Habba as acting U.S. attorney, extending her term for another 210 days.",
      "To keep Sarcone in place, Attorney General Pam Bondi named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" effectively giving him the power of a U.S. attorney, and he was named first assistant U.S. attorney, leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "The Trump administration employed similar maneuvers in Nevada and California in late July, this time appointing both interim U.S. attorneys in an acting capacity before the judges were to vote. Those two are Bilal \"Bill\" Essayli in California, and Sigal Chattah in Nevada.",
      "Why some of the acting U.S. attorneys have faced resistance",
      "The clash with the judiciary has come as some legal experts have expressed concern about actions taken by these Trump appointees or by comments they've made.",
      "Essayli, a former assistant U.S. attorney for California, has been accused of politicizing the office by pushing his staff to pursue cases regarded as being aligned with Trump's interests. This has contributed to an exodus from the Los Angeles-based district, Bloomberg Law reported. Essayli is the only one of the four who has prior experience as a prosecutor.",
      "Chattah was in private practice and previously ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general in Nevada. Critics have also accused her of using public office to pursue prosecutions of her political opponents and criticized her use of racially charged language in the past.",
      "A group of more than 100 former judges sent a letter to the District Court in Nevada, urging the judicial panel to reject the extension of Chattah's appointment on the grounds of inflammatory remarks she had made in the past. In 2022, she said of her opponent state attorney general's race, Aaron Ford, who is Black, that he should be \"hanging from a f****** crane.\"",
      "Chattah, an Israeli, said the comment was not racist and is just a common Israeli saying. Ford won the election and is still in office as Nevada's attorney general.",
      "Habba was one of Mr. Trump's\u00a0personal lawyers\u00a0before his 2024 election and was initially named White House counselor. As interim U.S. attorney, she initiated investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor and attorney general, on allegations that they were not cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Upon being named interim U.S. attorney, Habba said she'd use the office to help \"turn New Jersey red,\" though U.S. attorneys are supposed to remain politically neutral. She also filed and later dropped a criminal trespassing charge against the Newark mayor, a Democrat, and accused Democratic Rep. Monica McIver of felony assault at an immigration protest.",
      "It's not just judges, but also defendants who are challenging Habba's appointment, alleging she holds the office unlawfully. Two individuals being prosecuted by Habba's office have filed motions to dismiss their cases, arguing she illegitimately holds the position.",
      "On Friday, Sarcone's office in the Northern District of New York subpoenaed state Attorney General Letitia James as part of its investigation into whether she and her office violated Mr. Trump's civil rights in the fraud lawsuit she brought against him in 2022. He was found liable of civil fraud in February 2024, months before his re-election. Sarcone served in Mr. Trump's first administration as a regional administrator for the General Services Administration.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's offices in Northern New York, New Jersey, Nevada and California have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Sidestepping the Senate and the Judiciary",
      "Trump's administration isn't the first to exploit the acting official loophole \u2013 several administrations have relied on it in the past. In 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Vanita Gupta as acting head of the Justice Department Civil Rights Division amid the department's investigation into the Missouri shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown by a police officer. As the CATO Institute's Thomas Berry pointed out, Obama never nominated Gupta for the permanent position, but she served well beyond the 210 days allowed by the Vacancies Act. Gupta left office in January 2017, as Mr. Trump was beginning his first term.",
      "The scheme has received more attention from legal experts recently in light of the controversial nature of the four attorneys and the administration's overt push to sidestep the Senate and the judiciary.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Mr. Trump and Bondi have built a \"fantastic team\" of prosecutors with full departmental support. The spokesperson declined to comment on why the department chose to use the Vacancies Act to temporarily appoint the individuals, rather than sending them through the traditional Senate confirmation process.",
      "The Justice Department's use of the maneuver has raised the ire of several legal experts, who said they were concerned by the administration's moves to sidestep judicial authority.",
      "Michael Luttig, a former federal judge who signed onto the letter urging the rejection of Chattah's appointment, told CBS News that Mr. Trump's efforts to install U.S. attorneys without the Senate's approval are a part of a larger assault on the justice system and the rule of law.",
      "\"Every action that he's taken has been intended to harass, intimidate and threaten the federal judiciary into submission to his will,\" Luttig said.",
      "U.S. attorneys and the Vacancies Act",
      "Across the country, 93 U.S. attorneys lead the federal prosecutor's office in their judicial district. Each presidential appointee must be confirmed by the Senate to serve on a permanent basis. Confirmation can be a lengthy process, so, under the Vacancies Act, the president can temporarily appoint an individual to fill Senate-confirmed roles on an interim basis to allow agencies and offices to continue to function.",
      "The act enables the president to appoint an interim U.S. attorney to any of those positions for 120 days. If the Senate hasn't confirmed a nominee by the end of that period, judges in the corresponding federal district court may extend the interim appointee or install a candidate they choose as acting U.S. attorney for another 210 days.",
      "\"My understanding is that under prior administrations, there would be some behind-the-scenes communication to make sure that the interim U.S. attorney picked by the administration was acceptable to the District Court,\" Berry told CBS News.",
      "For three of the four contested nominees, Mr. Trump did not submit a nomination for the post to the Senate within the 120-day interim period. He nominated Habba to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey on June 30 but withdrew her nomination when it became evident that the Senate would not confirm her.",
      "In addition to Habba's rejection by the judges, also standing in the way of her ability to stay on in the office was her nomination. Under the Vacancies Act, a person may not serve as an acting officer if the president has submitted that individual's nomination to the Senate.",
      "Withdrawing Habba's nomination meant Mr. Trump could fire Grace and appoint Habba to replace her as first assistant, allowing her to assume the acting title.",
      "In New York, Sarcone reached the end of his 120-day term without a nomination pending before the Senate. When his term expired, the District Court declined to extend Sarcone, and didn't appoint anyone to the position. The Justice Department says its appointment of Sarcone as \"special attorney to the attorney general\" would confer him with the authority of a U.S. attorney and is \"indefinite.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, six of Mr. Trump's 49 interim U.S. attorneys have served the maximum 120 days allowed under that status. Andrew Boutros of the Northern District of Illinois and Joseph Murphy of the Western District of Tennessee, have also seen their interim appointments expire.",
      "In their cases, though, the District Courts voted to extend them on the 120th day, a person familiar with the decisions confirmed to CBS News.",
      "It's not clear whether the Trump administration will continue to use the maneuver to appoint other U.S. attorneys. Mr. Trump has named at least 45 interim U.S. attorneys since January and has submitted nominations to the Senate for at least 30 of those picks.",
      "In early August, the Senate approved the first two of Mr. Trump's nominees for U.S. attorneys: Jeanine Pirro to serve in the District of Columbia and Jason A. Reding Qui\u00f1ones for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "Democratic Sen.

      "The records include emails between top school district officials and also text messages and emails to and from at least two school police officers who were on the scene. The release also contains the personnel file of former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, who has been described as the on-scene commander of the law enforcement response.",
      "The release included a handful of text exchanges between Arredondo and others at the district that were sent before the shooting. At 9:04 a.m., the chief told officer Adrian Gonzales to \"go hang out at the park with the seniors until 11:30.\" At 11:40 a.m. a text to Arredondo from a district secretary noted someone reported hearing shots outside Robb Elementary.",
      "\"They went ahead and locked themselves down,\" the text to Arredondo read. At 1:07 p.m., a text to Arredondo asked if any students were injured or taken to the hospital and asked if the district can lift the \"secure status\" on the school. The shooter had been killed by law enforcement about 15 minutes earlier.",
      "Several bodycam videos show officers from multiple departments inside the school hallway and standing outside. Officers milling about suggest throwing gas in the window or searching for a key to the locked classroom, but it's unclear any of those suggestions are taken or who is in charge.",

      "In one video, an officer involved in the initial response can be heard saying, \"We can't see him at all\" before adding, \"We were at the front and he started shooting.\"",
      "The officer wearing the body cam asks: \"He's in a classroom, right?\" Another officer responds: \"With kids.\"",
      "Media organizations, including CBS News and The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed\u00a019 students and two teachers.",
      "A Texas appeals court in July upheld a lower court's ruling that the records must be released.",
      "The records are not the public's first glimpse inside one of the nation's deadliest mass shootings and a slow law enforcement response that has been widely condemned. Last year, city officials in Uvalde released police body camera videos and recordings of 911 calls.",
      "Nearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers. Multiple federal and state investigations into the response have laid bare cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers.",
      "Two school district officers face criminal charges for their actions that day. The former schools police chief, Arredondo, and former officer Adrian Gonzales both face multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment. Both men have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial later this year.",
      "They are the only two responding officers to have been charged.",
      "Laura Prather, media law chair for Haynes Boone, which represented the media organizations in the suit, said in a statement Monday night: \"More than three years after the Robb Elementary School shooting, the release of long-withheld public records by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District is an important step toward giving the community the answers they deserve. The court's ruling makes clear that government agencies cannot hide behind vague legal claims to withhold public information.\"",
      "\"Three years is already too long to wait for truth and transparency that could prevent future tragedies,\" Prather added.",

Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",

      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions.

      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced.

      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name.

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

      "Zelenskyy is due to meet with European leaders first, in preparation for a virtual call with Mr. Trump and Vice President Vance about an hour later. A call among leaders of countries involved in the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv \u2014 will be last.",
      "Zelensky said Wednesday that Ukraine and its allies must work together push Russia to end its invasion, French news agency AFP reported.",
      "\"Pressure must be exerted on Russia for the sake of a fair peace. We must learn from the experience of Ukraine and our partners to prevent deception on the part of Russia. There are currently no signs that the Russians are preparing to end the war,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media statement.",
      "On Wednesday, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets as the Kyiv government fights to repel Russia's invasion.",

      "European allies have pushed for Ukraine's involvement in any peace talks, fearful that discussions that exclude Kyiv could otherwise favor Moscow.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Mr. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "Zelenskyy warned that \"talks about us, without us, will not work.\"",
      "Ukrainian and European concerns",
      "The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.",
      "The overarching fear of many European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would not give up any territory it controls, saying that would be unconstitutional and would serve only as a springboard for a future Russian invasion.",
      "He said diplomatic discussions led by the U.S. focusing on ending the war have not addressed key Ukrainian demands, including security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression and including Europe in negotiations and rehabilitate Putin.",
      "General Sir Richard Shirreff, former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told CBS News partner network BBC News he didn't believe Friday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin could lead to an end of the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"Russia has to recognize and Putin has to recognize that Zelenskyy is president of Ukraine, recognize the Ukrainian constitution and Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state. And that is only going to happen ... when Russia gets a really bloody nose. And for that to happen, we need to see some proper strategic thinking from NATO - from the president of the United States - that recognizes that this is about transatlantic security.\"",
      "Shirreff said an end to the war would require Ukraine becoming a member of NATO.",
      "\"Even if Putin moves on or falls under a bus, we're probably likely to get somebody in place just as hard-line, just as ultra-nationalistic, and just as determined to press on (with Russia's takeover of Ukraine),\" Shirreff said. \"So I think we have to recognize that European security means deterrence - a band of deterrent steel, as I've said many times - from the Baltic to the Black Sea, with Ukraine as a NATO member. Now, however far-fetched that may seem from where we are at the moment, that's the reality. ... Any sort of compromise now, any so-called freezing of conflict, is only going to continue to postpone it.\"",
      "Trump-Putin summit to take place on Alaskan military base",
      "The summit between Mr. Trump and Putin will be the first in-person meeting between Putin and a sitting U.S. president since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News Tuesday. Given that it is peak tourist season in Alaska, there were few viable options to host the talks. Possible venues for the high-stakes meeting also needed to meet security requirements.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday that the mechanics of the meeting were \"still being ironed out.\"",
      "Leavitt described the meeting as \"a listening exercise for the president.\"",
      "\"Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,\" Leavitt said.",
      "\"Trump has obviously not been listening at all because it's very clear \u2014 and Putin continues to make it clear \u2014 what his demands are, and he's not stepped back one iota from his maximalist demands,\" former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Shirreff said. \"And those, as we've heard, are simply impossible for Ukraine to accept without capitulation.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room Monday, Mr. Trump expressed optimism that his meeting with Putin will be \"constructive,\" and said that he is planning to establish an in-person meeting involving Putin and Zelenskyy.",

      "In a study published Tuesday, scientists say they discovered a \"fast, sharp-toothed predator\" that would have been about the size of a dolphin.",
      "\"It's essentially a little whale with big eyes and a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth,\" said researcher Ruairidh Duncan. \"Imagine the shark-like version of a baleen whale \u2014 small and deceptively cute, but definitely not harmless.\"",
      "Museums Victoria released a video showing Duncan discuss the discovery and how researchers were able to identify the species.",
      "The skull belonged to a group of prehistoric whales known as the mammalodontids, distant smaller relatives of today's filter-feeding whales.",
      "It is the fourth mammalodontid species ever discovered, Museums Victoria said. And it is the third to be identified in Victoria following\u00a0discoveries in 2006 and 1939, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.",
      "\"This fossil opens a window into how ancient whales grew and changed, and how evolution shaped their bodies as they adapted to life in the sea,\" said palaeontologist Erich Fitzgerald, who co-authored the study.",
      "Victoria's Surf Coast lies on the Jan Juc Formation \u2014 a geological feature dating to the Oligocene epoch between 23 and 30 million years ago.",
      "A string of rare fossils have been unearthed along the scenic stretch of beach, a renowned site for the study of early whale evolution.",
      "\"This region was once a cradle for some of the most unusual whales in history, and we're only just beginning to uncover their stories,\" said Fitzgerald. \"We're entering a new phase of discovery.",
      "\"This region is rewriting the story of how whales came to rule the oceans, with some surprising plot twists.\"",
      "Fitzgerald told the ABC the whale was unique to Australia.",
      "\"If they were alive today, they would be as iconically Australian as a kangaroo,\" he said.",
      "The species was named Janjucetus dullardi, a nod to local Ross Dullard who stumbled across the skull while strolling the beach in 2019.",
      "It was described in the peer-reviewed Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.",
      "The discovery comes two years after scientists announced they discovered an ancient whale in Peru that could be the heaviest animal ever to exist.",

The Europeans are desperate to exert some influence over the meeting from which they have been sidelined. Mr. Trump has said that he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office on Tuesday confirmed to CBS News that he will attend a virtual meeting with Mr. Trump and European leaders on Wednesday.",
      "The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin \u2014 who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the EU \u2014 might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.",
      "The overarching fear for European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "In a statement early on Tuesday, the leaders said that they \"welcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\" But, they underlined, \"the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\"",
      "\"A just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force,\" they said.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a social media post Tuesday that \"we all support President Trump's determination, and together we must shape positions that will not allow Russia to deceive the world once again.\"",
      "The Ukrainian president has rejected the idea that Ukraine must commit to giving up land to secure a ceasefire. Russia holds shaky control over four of the country's regions, two in the country's east and two in the south.",
      "\"We see that the Russian army is not preparing to end the war. On the contrary, they are making movements that indicate preparations for new offensive operations,\" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. \"As long as they continue the war and occupation, all of us together must maintain our pressure \u2014 the pressure of strength, the pressure of sanctions, the pressure of diplomacy. I thank everyone who is helping. Peace through strength.\"",
      "Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the chief of Zelenskyy's office, said anything short of Russia's strategic defeat would mean that any ceasefire deal would be on Moscow's terms, erode international law and send a dangerous signal to the world.",
      "Putin's ultimate goal is to \"eliminate Ukraine as a sovereign state by dismantling its military, foreign policy and right to self-determination,\" Podolyak said on Telegram.",

      "Military analysts using open source information to monitor the battles say the next 24-48 hours could be critical. Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important battlefield victory ahead of the summit. It would also complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of its military efforts.",
      "\"A lot will depend on availability, quantity and quality of Ukrainian reserves,\" Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, wrote in a post on X late Monday.",
      "Ukraine's military said its forces are fending off Russian infantry units trying to infiltrate their defensive positions in the Donetsk region. The region's Ukrainian military command posted on Facebook Monday that enemy soldiers penetrating Ukrainian lines to capture more territory \"face inevitable death\" but acknowledges that the situation remains \"difficult, unpleasant and dynamic.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump repeated that \"there'll be some land swapping going on.\" He said that this would involve \"some bad stuff for both\" Ukraine and Russia. His seemingly public rehabilitation of Putin \u2014 a pariah in most of Europe \u2014 has unnerved Ukraine's backers.",
      "Mr. Trump was also critical of Zelenskyy, noting that Ukraine's leader had been in power for the duration of the war and said \"nothing happened\" during that time. He contrasted that with Putin, who has wielded power unchallenged in Russia for decades.",
      "It's unclear whether the Europeans were unsettled by Mr. Trump mistakenly saying twice he would be traveling to Russia on Friday to meet Putin. The summit is taking place in Alaska, which was colonized by Russia in the 18th century until Czar Alexander II sold it to the U.S. in a land deal in 1867.",
      "The Europeans will make a fresh attempt to rally Mr. Trump to Ukraine's cause on Wednesday at virtual meetings convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Mr. Trump did not confirm whether he would take part, but he did say: \"I'm going to get everybody's ideas\" before meeting with Putin.",
      "Tuesday's statement was also meant to be a demonstration of European unity.

      "The release follows a period of revisions that administration officials said were meant to \"streamline\" the reports, which cover events in about 200 countries in 2024 and had been largely completed by the end of the Biden administration. A note included with the reports said they had been \"adjusted\" to be \"aligned to the administration's executive orders.\"",

      "Mandated by Congress, the reports have been produced annually by the State Department for decades and are used by U.S. policymakers, human rights workers, foreign governments and judicial bodies worldwide as a resource to inform potential arms sales and court proceedings, and they also function as a U.S.-led check on government corruption and abuses.",
      "Rights groups and former State Department officials decried the revisions as an \"erasure\" of the plight of marginalized communities and what they said was a politically motivated move that undermined the prior value of the reports.",

      "This year's report for Hungary notes \"no credible reports of significant human rights abuses\" though last year's included extensive mention of \"serious government corruption\" and restrictions on media freedom.",
      "Meanwhile the 2024 report for the United Kingdom notes the \"human rights situation worsened,\" citing \"credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\" A similar assessment was offered for Germany and France, countries administration officials including Vice President JD Vance have publicly accused of censorship and the suppression of free speech.",
      "Asked by a reporter how the Trump administration squares its stricter monitoring of free expression via social media accounts of U.S. visa applicants with its criticism of European countries restricting hate speech, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a press briefing Tuesday that \"restrictive laws against dis-favored voices, often on political or religious grounds \u2014 no matter how disagreeable someone's speech may be \u2014 to criminalize it, or silencing it by force only serves as a catalyst for further hatred, suppression, and polarization.\"",

      "The report acknowledged a Committee to Protect Journalists figure of 82 Palestinian journalists having been killed in the conflict last year, but also included a line saying that \"[i]n some cases, the IDF claimed the journalists killed were embedded with Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "The report did acknowledge troubling human rights records in several countries with which it has struck agreements to deport third national nationals, such as Libya. It noted credible reports of \"arbitrary or unlawful killings; disappearances; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest and detention\" and other abuses.",
      "It also noted of Afghanistan that there was \"widespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those responsible for human rights abuses.\" The U.S. terminated temporary protected status for Afghans last month, leaving more than 12,000 vulnerable to deportation.",
      "Reports for Russia, China, North Korea and Iran noted this year, as they did in previous years, \"significant\" human rights issues and included criticism of inaction by their respective governments to identify or punish those who had committed abuses.",

    "story": [
      "What was intended as a fundraising mission has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica since June.",
      "Last year, Guo began a journey to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents. The trip also aimed to raise $1 million for childhood cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Guo flew his Cessna 182Q to North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe before heading to Antarctica.",
      "Prosecutors said he was authorized to fly to the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, which is often used as a base for excursions to Antarctica. Authorities said Guo provided \"false flight plan data\" and traveled to King George Island. Guo's flight plan only included his landing in Punta Arenas, authorities said. Chile claims ownership of the island, which is about 75 miles off the coast of Antarctica.",
      "Guo was detained at the airport on King George Island. On June 29, he was charged with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, both breaches of the Chilean Aeronautical Code. The code calls for short-term imprisonment or a fine for anyone who lands on the country's territory without authorization.",
      "Chilean prosecutor Cristi\u00e1n Cristoso also said that Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes used to travel there. The unauthorized flight posed safety risks for other air travelers, Cristoso said.",
      "Since being charged, Guo has stayed at a military base on the island. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take.",
      "Guo was also unable to fly his Cessna. Cristoso told reporters on Monday that Guo's plane \"does not have the capabilities to make a flight,\" but did not provide more details.",
      "On Monday, a judge dropped the charges against Guo as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chilean prosecutors. The agreement requires Guo make a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days to avoid a trial. He must also leave Chile as soon as conditions allow, and is prohibited from reentering Chilean territory for three years.",
      "The prosecutor's office said Guo must also pay all costs for his \"aircraft security and personal maintenance\" during his stay at the military facility. He also needs to cover all expenses for his return.",
      "Guo told The Associated Press in a text that he was \"relieved by the outcome.\"",
      "Guo said he is awaiting approval for his departure flight from Antarctica. He is talking with his lawyer to see if there is any way he can continue to fly his Cessna, and said he hopes he can continue with his \"original mission.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement it will maintain a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he expected to determine mere moments into his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week whether it would be possible to work out a deal to halt the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House press conference where he announced plans for a federal takeover of Washington's police force to help combat crime.",
      "He said he thought Friday's sitdown with Putin in Alaska would be \"really a feel-out meeting.\" Mr. Trump added that \"it'll be good, but it might be bad\" and predicted he may say, \"lots of luck, keep fighting. Or I may say, we can make a deal.\"",
      "Putin wants to lock in Russia's gains since invading Ukraine in February 2022 as Mr. Trump presses for a ceasefire that has remained out of reach. Mr. Trump's eagerness to reach a deal has raised fears in Ukraine and Europe about such an agreement favoring Russia, without sufficient input from Ukraine. Mr. Trump has alternately harshly criticized both leaders after promising \u2014 and so far failing \u2014 to swiftly end the conflict.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"it is important to see how serious Putin is, and the only one who can do that is President Trump.\"",
      "\"It's really crucial that a meeting takes place. It will not be the final say on this,\" Rutte said. \"Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved in Europe, but it is important to start the next phase of this process, putting pressure on the Russians, exactly as President Trump has been doing over the last six months.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was especially dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace.",
      "He said the Ukrainian president had been to \"a lot of meetings\" without managing to halt a war that Russia started. Mr. Trump also noted that Zelenskyy had been in power for the duration of the war and said \"nothing happened\" during that time. He contrasted that with Putin, who has wielded power in Russia for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, \"The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin\" but it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "European allies have pushed for Ukraine's involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow.",
      "To that point, Mr. Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to \"tell them what kind of a deal \u2014 I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Zelenskyy was hounded out of the Oval Office in February after Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance suggested he hadn't been grateful enough for U.S. support.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn't appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. His comments Monday suggested he might have had another change of heart.",
      "\"President Putin invited me to get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he thought it was \"very respectful\" that Putin is coming to the U.S. for Friday's meeting, instead of insisting that Mr. Trump go to Russia.",
      "\"I'd like to see a ceasefire. I'd like to see the best deal that can be made for both parties,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president repeated that any major agreement could involve land swaps, without elaborating. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn't done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday's meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations.",
      "Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow's sphere of influence.",
      "Zelenskyy insists he will never consent to any formal Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or give up a bid for NATO membership.",
      "Putin believes he has the advantage on the ground as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances along the 600-mile front. On the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war.",
      "With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday.",
      "The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and \"related issues of territorial claims and security.\"",
      "Steffen Meyer, spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said the German government \"has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force\" and that Ukraine should decide its own fate \"independently and autonomously.\"",
      "Earlier, a Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two others in a region some 260 miles east of Moscow.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:33:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The government of Niger has launched an investigation into what they call possible \"illicit international trafficking\" after a piece of Mars unearthed in the Sahara Desert was sold.",
    "story": [
      "It's the\u00a0largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth\u00a0\u2014 a 54-pound meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record.",
      "But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible \"illicit international trafficking,\" claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. Sotheby's, the auction house, has disputed the claim.",
      "The government of Niger says it has launched an official investigation \"to identify the circumstances of its discovery and sale.\" While the country doesn't have specific legislation regarding meteorites, an international heritage law is being looked into.",
      "Here's what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:",
      "How the meteorite was found",
      "Sotheby's said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles to Earth.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "It was discovered in the\u00a0Sahara\u00a0in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.",
      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private gallery in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction. It is the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to\u00a0NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell in Namibia.",
      "Why Niger is investigating",
      "Following the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.",
      "Niger's government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite's discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \"akin to illicit international trafficking.\"",
      "Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of \"precious stones, semi-precious stones and meteorites nationwide\" to ensure their traceability.",
      "Sotheby's, which regularly auctions meteorites, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that the meteorite was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.",
      "\"As with everything we sell, all necessary documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved,\" the statement read.",
      "Authorities in Niger did not respond to AP questions.",
      "What international law says",
      "While global agreements are in place to regulate the trade of cultural artifacts, there is ambiguity about whether meteorites are covered.",
      "Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property \u2014 which Niger and the U.S. have ratified \u2014 meteorites can qualify as cultural property.",
      "However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S.",
      "\"If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,\" she told the AP.",
      "Some countries, like Morocco, one of the leading sources of meteorites on the international market, require restitution if the objects are discovered on their territory. But enforcement has been challenging due to the vast desert areas and informal trading networks.",

      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",
      "A planetarium program coordinator at a museum in St. Paul, Minnesota, is advising people to instead go out a week or so past the peak when the moon isn't so bright.",
      "The Perseids \"are an incredible meteor shower,\" Thaddeus LaCoursiere, of the Bell Museum, told The Associated Press.",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before the sun comes up, in the Northern Hemisphere. However, meteors sometimes can be seen as early as 10 p.m.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "During peak, Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the Earth will pass closest to the core orbit of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, Lunsford writes.",
      "\"To view the Perseids successfully, it is suggested you watch from a safe rural area that is as dark as possible,\" he says. \"The more stars you can see, the more meteors will also be visible.\"",

      "While the deal began in 2020 and now includes five Sussex-branded media projects in addition to Markle's As Ever lifestyle brand, experts questioned if the extended partnership with the streaming giant signaled a downward trend for the royals.",
      "Despite the success of her recent \"With Love, Meghan\" series, The Hollywood Reporter claimed the Netflix change mirrored the \"downgrade\" the Obamas experienced with the streamer and their Higher Ground banner.",
      "MEGHAN MARKLE'S LEGAL CLASH WITH HALF-SISTER COULD DERAIL PRINCE HARRY'S ROYAL RECONCILIATION",
      "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex extended their partnership with Netflix on Monday with a first-look deal for their Archewell Productions banner. (Karwai Tang/WireImage)",
      "\"We're proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As ever brand,\" Markle said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision.\"",

      "\"There clearly is no repeat of the reported $100 million Netflix offered before. This first-look deal is certain to be less, probably a good deal less. It is true that Netflix continues to link with As Ever, Meghan's lifestyle brand, and that may be the most commercially successful part of this new arrangement.\"",
      "According to The New York Times, citing a source, the deal is indeed reportedly worth less for Harry and Meghan than their last arrangement with Netflix.",
      "Meghan Markle's \"With Love, Meghan\" picked up a second season on Netflix. (Netflix)",
      "Meanwhile, Fitzwilliams added, \"If you don't do much you don't deserve much, and we've been reading about how they will adapt \u2018Meet Me At The Lake\u2019 for ages.\"",
      "In August 2023, the couple purchased the rights to Carley Fortune's best-selling romance novel, \"Meet Me at the Lake,\" and had plans to make the page-turner into a feature film. It is reportedly still in the works.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",

      "\"While it appears like a negative downgrade on first pass, that's akin to reading only headlines versus the fine print,\" Eldridge said. \"In other words, Harry and Meghan still have several other creative projects with Netflix, as well as an expanded relationship around the As Ever lifestyle brand. The latter will be a revenue generator for both sides, which is difficult to create (much less sustain) around traditional reality television.",

      "\"This might not be a home run for Markle, but it's certainly not the strikeout critics might have been hoping for.\"",
      "Eldridge noted that the couple could have faced a bigger setback if they had \"placed all their eggs in the reality/pseudo-doc category.\"",
      "\"This might not be a home run for Markle, but it's certainly not the strikeout critics might have been hoping for.\"",
      "\"I'm not sure what the market looks like, in terms of a would-be bidding war, now that the exclusivity clause is set to expire,\" Eldridge explained. \"That said, just like the boosters and fuel tank eventually fall off the space shuttle as it ascends into orbit, so too might be the case with Harry and Meghan, as they climb higher to their bigger, broader, vision.\"",
      "The \"Heart of Invictus\" focused on Prince Harry's global event which helps wounded service members heal through sports. (Karwai Tang/WireImage)",
      "\"If this series was what was required to get them into orbit, then it was certainly a win, as they are now able to explore the 'deep space' of other ventures, which are not only intellectually more diverse, but also don't require them to be the 'name and face' behind the product itself.\"",
      "Still, royal expert Ian Pelham Turner said the Netflix shift alluded to unanswered questions about the couple's future branding potential from within the streaming giant.",
      "\"Obviously, Netflix feels that Harry and Meghan are losing brand value based on their current standing,\" Turner told Fox News Digital. \"However, the streaming giant may have made a fundamental mistake in that the isolated position the couple are currently in could rapidly change if negotiations [return] to the U.K.\"",
      "\"Perhaps there could be a new approach of them becoming royal ambassadors in America,\" Turner stated, noting that \"it could see their brand value soaring.\"",
      "For now, season two of \"With Love, Meghan\" will premiere this month, and a special holiday episode will air in December.",
      "\"Harry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere,\" Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said in a statement. \"The response to their work speaks for itself \u2014 Harry & Meghan gave viewers an intimate look into their lives and quickly became one of our most-watched documentary series.\"",
      "\"More recently, fans have been inspired by With Love, Meghan, with products from the new As ever line consistently selling out in record time. We\u2019re excited to continue our partnership with Archewell Productions and to entertain our members together.\"",

These facts directly contradict the drug\u2019s primary marketing message of 'safe' and 'effective,'\" the letter reads, citing studies published earlier this year by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPA), a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group.",

      "\"Alternatively, in light of the serious risks to women who are presently being prescribed this drug without crucial safeguards, and in the event the FDA is unable to reinstate the 2011 safety protocols for mifepristone, the FDA should consider withdrawing mifepristone from the market until it completes its review and can decide on a course of action based on objective safety and efficacy criteria,\" the attorneys general wrote.",

      "Last year, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the drug's availability. The plaintiffs had sought to restrict access to mifepristone across the country, including in Democrat-led states where abortion remains legal.

      "\"The FDA\u2019s removal of these crucial safety protocols in 2016 (and in 2023) that only five years before the FDA considered necessary begs the question of whether the removal was motivated by considerations other than the safety of patients \u2026 The current FDA\u2019s dedication to the health and wellbeing of all Americans is encouraging, as is the much-needed review of mifepristone that Secretary Kennedy has promised,\" the letter concludes."

      "How these trackable shoes work",
      "Instead of baking in a GPS system, Skechers took a simpler route. The model, officially called Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers, features a screw-secured compartment beneath the insole. That's where you can insert your own\u00a0Apple AirTag. Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone. It updates the tag's location as long as it remains near an Apple device. Since AirTags were made to track objects like keys and bags, slipping one into a shoe was just a matter of time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The pros: Clever design and smart functionality",
      "Skechers designed these shoes with both practicality and peace of mind in mind. They feature an adaptive closure system with stretch laces and an adjustable instep strap, making it easy for kids to slip them on and off without help. Comfort isn't an afterthought either. Each pair includes a Skechers Air-Cooled Goga Mat insole with high-rebound cushioning, giving growing feet the support they need throughout the day. Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function. They're available in sizes for boys and girls, and even without an AirTag, they work perfectly as everyday sneakers.",

      "Still, parents should be aware: these are not GPS shoes with real-time, all-the-time tracking.\u00a0AirTags\u00a0rely on nearby Apple devices to update their location. If the tag moves out of range or its battery dies, the updates stop. Another issue? Anyone who has access to your Apple account can view the tag's location. While you can manage and revoke access in your iPhone settings, this means privacy depends on your own security habits. And yes, it's possible for someone to remove the battery and disable an AirTag in seconds. That means this shoe-tracking feature won't replace supervision; it's simply a backup.",

It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access. But don't confuse shoe tracking with child safety. These trainers can offer location updates, but they can't think, speak, or call for help. Think of them as one extra tool, not your only one.",

      "In a recent takedown, WhatsApp and Meta partnered with OpenAI to shut down a scam operation linked to Cambodia.

Once trust was built, scammers asked for crypto deposits to unlock fake earnings.",

Scammers will always find new angles and often prey on the same people across multiple platforms. That's why it's smart to take extra steps beyond what WhatsApp offers. Here are five ways to add layers of protection:",
      "Scammers often try to trick you into clicking on links or downloading files that can compromise your device. A strong antivirus program can block these threats before they do harm. It can also alert you to phishing attempts disguised as WhatsApp messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "People wearing the TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "How TrueLimb sets itself apart from other bionic arms",
      "TrueLimb is a full-arm prosthetic solution designed to feel more like an extension of the body than a mechanical device. Each arm is personalized to match the user's opposing limb, down to fingertip size and skin tone. A wide range of color options are available, including natural shades, jet black and metallic silver.",
      "Instead of relying on standard sizes, TrueLimb is custom-built using a remote 3D scanning system. This digital process eliminates the need for in-person fittings and allows for precise, individualized design. The socket is breathable, adjustable and crafted for all-day wear. A built-in BOA dial lets users fine-tune the fit with ease. At just 1.0 to 1.5 pounds from socket to fingertip, the prosthetic remains lightweight and comfortable.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Smart sensors power intuitive, muscle-based control",
      "TrueLimb features TrueSense technology, which includes over 30 topographical sensors embedded within the socket. These sensors detect subtle muscle movements on the residual limb, delivering accurate and responsive control, even when the limb is covered or sweating.",
      "While often referred to as \"mind-controlled,\" TrueLimb does not read brain signals directly. Instead, it uses advanced sensors to pick up electrical activity from muscles in the residual limb. These signals reflect the user\u2019s intended movements, allowing the prosthetic to respond in real time, creating a seamless, intuitive experience that feels like second nature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The system adapts automatically by identifying the most active myo sites, deactivating less useful sensors and fine-tuning responsiveness based on the user's signal strength. This ensures consistent performance, even if muscle activity changes over time.",
      "The prosthetic includes six intuitive grip patterns to support a wide range of daily activities. Independent finger joints allow the hand to wrap around objects naturally, offering both strength and flexibility. The device is precise enough to handle delicate tasks, such as lifting an egg without cracking it.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Feel touch again with haptic feedback technology",
      "Beyond movement, TrueLimb gives the user back a sense of touch. Gentle vibrations provide feedback when the prosthetic hand makes contact with objects. This helps users operate the device without always needing to look down, making actions more fluid and natural. The thumb is manually opposable, giving the user better control over grip force and object handling. Whether opening a bottle or holding a pen, the motion feels smooth and confident.",
      "Built for daily life with durable, lightweight materials",
      "TrueLimb is made with PA12 nylon, a highly durable material used in industrial-grade applications. The entire arm is built to withstand daily life. It's splash-resistant, heat-resistant, stain-resistant and tough enough to handle impact or abrasion. Thanks to its rubberized palm and coated fingertips, the hand maintains a firm grip on smooth or slippery surfaces. And with bionic strength, it can lift objects up to 15 pounds with ease.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Fast charging and multi-day battery life",
      "Power won't hold the user back. TrueLimb uses a USB-C charger, the same kind used for most phones and laptops, so no special adapter is needed. A high-capacity 5600mAh battery provides multi-day life, giving freedom to move without frequent recharges. The device also receives over-the-air software updates, so performance improves over time without needing to return the device. Behind the scenes, analytics tools help optimize each arm's performance based on how it's being used.",
      "How TrueLimb is designed and delivered from home",
      "One of the most innovative parts of the TrueLimb process is how it reaches users. Everything happens remotely. Users receive a 3D scanner in the mail to capture the shape of their limb. The data goes directly to the Unlimited Tomorrow team, which builds the prosthetic in-house. This approach eliminates middlemen and dramatically speeds up delivery. Users typically receive their completed prosthetic within weeks.",
      "TrueLimb is pictured in the box in which it was delivered. (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or a loved one needs a prosthetic arm, this technology changes everything. You no longer need to wait months, file insurance claims or attend repeated fittings. With TrueLimb, you get a high-tech, customized solution faster and at a lower cost. You also gain full control and comfort. The sensors respond to your muscle signals without any lag. The arm fits your body, looks natural and feels like part of you.",

Scammers often use financial buzzwords like \"IRA consolidation\" or \"required minimum distribution guidance.\" The goal? To make you feel like you're dealing with a trusted expert. They create fake advisor profiles, complete with headshots, license numbers and U.S. contact info. Many even add logos or branding from familiar banks to boost credibility. But once you respond, they'll ask for private financial info or, worse, get you to transfer funds directly into their accounts.",
      "A woman typing on her laptop and taking notes in her notebook. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why older adults are prime targets",
      "Scammers love targeting seniors because they typically have savings and are making major financial decisions. Plus, their data is easier to get. The unregulated data broker industry makes it easy for bad actors to find and target seniors with laser focus.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How scammers get your data",
      "These scams are fueled by data purchased from brokers. These companies gather your details, compile profiles and sell them, often without your knowledge. You could appear on lists labeled \"Retirees with $250k+ Net Worth\" or \"Homeowners Nearing Retirement.\" It's disturbingly precise. Some brokers scrape public records, while others buy data from loyalty cards, surveys or sweepstakes. Bottom line: this happens quietly, behind your back.",
      "The financial toll of these scams",
      "In 2024, the FBI reported that seniors lost over $4.8 billion to scams, a record high. Retirement-related fraud was a major part of that. Once your money is gone, it's usually gone for good. Even if the scammer misled you, your bank may not cover the loss if you authorized the transaction. These scams drain more than just savings. They create lasting stress, fear and shame. Prevention is your best defense.",

Many also believe these tools are capable of forming deep emotional bonds, beyond just light or casual interactions.",

      "3. Set digital guidelines: Discuss privacy, safety and what to do if an AI ever gives advice that feels off or makes them uncomfortable.",
      "4. Stay informed: Monitor which apps your teen uses and how often. Some offer parental settings or usage insights.",

      "During early design discussions, Daria Sheina skimmed past a rough sketch of two rotated cuboid volumes, thinking it wasn't fully developed. But her clients, Sean Sikorski and Chadd Andre, immediately paused on it, drawn to its bold simplicity. Their reaction sparked what would become the defining form of The Nest \u2014 two interlocked geometric shapes, rotated and stacked like modern building blocks carved out of wood.",

      "A compact electric quadricycle is designed to tackle the challenges of city living while offering accessible and eco-friendly transportation.",
      "Electric vehicles often grab headlines for innovation, but they rarely get credit for affordability. That's where Chinese automaker BYD is flipping the script.",
      "The company introduced the Atto 1 at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show, and it's turning heads for all the right reasons. Priced at around $12,000, this fully electric hatchback offers modern features, urban-ready performance, and a price tag that could finally bring EVs to the masses.",

      "Exterior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "Atto 1's features and affordable EV performance",
      "The Atto 1 may fall into the budget category, but it delivers solid specs for city driving. It produces 55 kilowatts, or about 75 horsepower, along with 100 pound-feet of torque. Its top speed is 80 miles per hour, and it accelerates from zero to 30 miles per hour in just under five seconds. These numbers won't blow anyone away at the track, but they hit the sweet spot for daily use.",
      "The standard version comes with a 30.08-kilowatt-hour Blade battery, which gives the car a range of up to 186 miles under the NEDC testing cycle. Drivers looking for a bit more distance can opt for the long-range model. That version features a 38.88-kilowatt-hour battery and extends the range to about 236 miles. Even with the larger battery, the car remains affordable at roughly $14,500.",
      "Charging the Atto 1 is straightforward. It supports AC charging at speeds up to 6.6 kilowatts. It also accepts DC fast charging, with the base model charging at 30 kilowatts and the extended-range version charging at 40 kilowatts. Each version includes a vehicle-to-load system, so you can power small devices using the car's battery if needed.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "Inside the Atto 1: Compact electric car with smart comfort",
      "Despite its price, the Atto 1 delivers more than the bare essentials. It comes equipped with a 7-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system. You'll also get wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth phone-as-key functionality, and automatic LED headlights. Keyless entry, start, and NFC digital key compatibility add to the convenience, while single-zone air conditioning and four built-in speakers round out the cabin experience.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "If you upgrade to the long-range version, you'll notice a few more touches that make daily driving feel smoother. It features a powered driver's seat, wireless charging for your phone, and a steering wheel that adjusts for both height and reach. Even small conveniences, like a one-touch power window with pinch protection, make it feel like a more premium vehicle.",
      "In terms of size, the Atto 1 measures just under 156 inches long and about 68 inches wide. That makes it slightly larger than the Mitsubishi Mirage but still smaller than a Toyota Yaris. Unlike either of those gas-powered models, the Atto 1 is fully electric and built with clean transportation in mind.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1 (BYD)",
      "Why BYD's Atto 1 EV launch is perfectly timed for global buyers",
      "The Atto 1's release comes as major automakers begin ramping up their own EV efforts in Asia. Toyota, which controls roughly 30 percent of the Indonesian car market, has already announced plans to begin producing electric vehicles in the country by the end of 2025. BYD's decision to launch an affordable EV now reflects a different strategy, offering a real, driveable solution that doesn't force buyers to wait years or spend a fortune.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For people around the world, access to a private vehicle means independence. Many of those people also want to transition away from internal combustion engines, but cost remains a major barrier. That's where the Atto 1 could make a global impact. It provides a realistic way for people to go electric without breaking their budget or sacrificing comfort.",
      "Interior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If a car like the Atto 1 enters the U.S. market, it could change the game for everyday drivers. First time buyers, students, and city dwellers looking for a compact, clean, and connected ride might finally have an option that fits both their lifestyle and their wallet. The Atto 1 may not drive itself or hit 200 miles per hour, but it's designed to handle real-world needs with style and reliability.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric cars won't truly change the world unless they become accessible. That means more than just flashy features or long ranges. It means building EVs that people can actually afford and use every day. BYD's Atto 1 might not dominate the luxury market, but it hits a far more important target, putting electric vehicles within reach for more people, in more places, right now.",

      "The new scam is giving parkers everywhere a major headache.",
      "By now, many of us have used QR codes as a way to quickly access menus, check into places, and make payments. But now, these convenient and contactless methods have become an easy target for cybercriminals. There has been a recent surge in \"quishing\" attacks, which are a form of phishing that uses QR codes instead of traditional methods like emails, text messages, and phone calls.",
      "Quishing is proving effective, too, with millions of people unknowingly opening malicious websites. In fact, 73% of Americans admit to scanning QR codes without checking if the source is legitimate. As experts warn, this growing trend could put people's personal information and money at risk.",

      "MULTIPLE US CANCER CENTERS HIT IN COORDINATED PHISHING BREACH",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of quishing is concerning",
      "NordVPN's security researchers report that fake QR codes have tricked over 26 million people into visiting malicious websites. These codes hide in plain sight, too. In one case, they were stuck on top of payment portals, sending unsuspecting individuals to sites meant to steal their personal and financial data (e.g., passwords and credit card information). Some even installed malware on people's phones.",
      "Even government agencies have taken notice. The FTC warned the public earlier this year that cybercriminals are now attaching harmful QR codes to packages and sending them to people. The New York City Department of Transportation issued warnings about fake QR codes appearing on parking meters of all places. Even Hawaii Electric chimed in, as they noticed scammers are using QR codes to steal payments.",
      "These tactics mirror the ATM skimmer scam, where criminals place keypads designed to log keystrokes over an ATM to steal card information. But with QR codes, this tampering is harder to spot and easier to implement.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "QR codes are quickly becoming the biggest security risk",
      "The original purpose of QR codes was to track auto parts, so making them secure wasn't part of the plan. Their widespread use today has made them irresistible to scammers. Unlike traditional phishing methods, they make it easy for cybercriminals to hide their destination until scanned, removing an important layer of user scrutiny.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers are leveraging this ambiguity to deploy Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and infiltrate personal devices, including military networks. More than 26% of malicious links now come via QR codes, according to KeepNet Labs, a cybersecurity company specializing in AI-driven phishing simulation and human risk management. Soon, quishing will outpace conventional phishing.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from quishing",
      "If you scan QR codes regularly, you might be panicking. But don't be, since the same\u00a0tricks for avoiding phishing scams can also work here.",
      "Pause and consider the origin of every QR code before you pull out your phone. Quishing thrives on people scanning codes found on public signage, restaurant tables, packages, or payment terminals without questioning their authenticity. Cybercriminals often cover genuine QR codes with malicious ones that redirect users to fake websites meant to steal personal and financial information. Always ask yourself: Do I trust this location or the person who provided this QR code? If in doubt, don't scan.",
      "Consider using a reputable personal data removal service. These services routinely scan the web for your personal details (like addresses, phone numbers, and emails), removing them from public databases where cybercriminals might collect information to personalize their quishing lures.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inspect the QR code's placement. Sophisticated scammers physically overlay fake QR codes on legitimate signs, especially on payment kiosks, parking meters, and package labels. If the QR code looks tampered with or is a sticker poorly placed over another code, avoid scanning it, as this is a common quishing tactic to redirect you to a malicious site.",
      "After scanning any QR code, double-check the URL before clicking through. One of quishing's dangers is that QR codes obscure their destination until scanned. If the web address looks suspicious, misspelled, unusually long, or filled with random characters, close the browser immediately. Never enter sensitive details like passwords or credit card information on a site you weren't expecting to visit.",
      "Install strong antivirus software across all your devices. Look for a solution that offers real-time protection, regularly updated threat databases, and built-in web protection. These tools can help detect malicious content hidden in QR codes and block dangerous websites that might automatically open after scanning. Since QR codes are increasingly used by cybercriminals to spread malware like Remote Access Trojans (RATs), having strong antivirus software in place is essential. To stay fully protected, make sure the software is set to update automatically and scan regularly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Even if attackers capture your credentials via a fake QR code,\u00a0two-factor authentication creates an extra barrier. Always activate 2FA on your accounts, especially for email, banking, and other sensitive services. It thwarts many of the most damaging results of phishing, including those initiated by QR code scans.",
      "Whenever possible, manually navigate to websites instead of using a QR code, especially for payments, reservations, or account access. Searching for an event, restaurant, or service online reduces the chance of being tricked by a malicious redirect or fraudulent site.",
      "Frequently update your phone's operating system and apps. Criminals often exploit software vulnerabilities, and manufacturers regularly issue security patches.\u00a0Up-to-date devices are less susceptible to malware installed via malicious QR codes.",
      "If you encounter what you believe to be a fraudulent QR code or fall victim to a quishing attempt, report it immediately to the organization involved and your local authorities or consumer protection agency. Your report helps others avoid similar attacks and keeps organizations alert to evolving scam tactics.",
      "By applying these steps, you make it significantly harder for cybercriminals to use QR codes as a gateway to your personal or financial information. In a world where 73% of Americans scan QR codes without checking the source, increased caution is your first and best line of defense against the quishing surge.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "QR codes are super convenient, but the risks they bring are becoming impossible to ignore. And you can count on scammers getting more creative as time goes on. That doesn't mean you have to stop using QR codes altogether, it just means staying informed and cautious is a must, because QR codes aren't going anywhere anytime soon.",

Markus has continued to represent Maxwell and was involved in interviews between the Department of Justice and Maxwell, which took place in late-July over a two-day period.",
      "Following the interviews, Maxwell was transferred from a federal prison facility in Tallahassee, Florida, to a Federal Prison camp in Bryan, Texas. Neither the Department of Justice nor Maxwell's attorney explained why she was transferred.",

      "\"I love what I do,\" Markus said during the interview. \"I love representing the underdog. You know, being a criminal defense lawyer isn't for everybody, but it is one of the most rewarding and great jobs there is, and I really enjoy what I do. So, you know, this case, as all my cases, is an honor to be able to help somebody.\"",
      "While Markus has represented Maxwell going back to 2021, he has also represented other high-profile defendants, including politicians and athletes.",

      "Markus also represented Tom Grady, a Naples, Florida-based attorney who was accused of obstructing waters in the Florida Keys, according to Naples News.",
      "In January 2014, Grady filed applications with state agencies to build a dock and two boat lifts, but the U.S. government claimed federal permits were necessary.",
      "Prosecutors alleged the dock and two boat lifts violated the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which barred any bridge or dam from being built over some navigable waters. A jury in 2021 found him not guilty of the violations.",
      "As Epstein's death and previous criminal cases were brought back into the spotlight, Markus has made an effort to get Maxwell out of jail.",
      "Maxwell in late July filed a brief with the Supreme Court asking justices to consider her appeal, which seeks a ruling on Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement signed in 2007.

      "On a recent morning, Centreville High School teacher Zenaida Perez had a surprise visitor at the northern Virginia school where she teaches English as a second language: a high-powered lawyer investigating allegations that Perez\u00a0had made public that a school social worker coaxed and funded a student\u2019s 2021 abortion.",
      "The Clifton school district\u2019s superintendent, Michelle Reid,\u00a0responded to the allegations the next day, claiming the school system had just \"learned yesterday\" about the potential scandal. Last Thursday, Reid emailed Centreville High School parents, again claiming that the district had taken \"immediate action to engage an external independent investigator to get all the facts.\"",
      "VIRGINIA SCHOOL SYSTEM INVESTIGATING CLAIMS STAFF ARRANGED STUDENTS' ABORTIONS WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT",
      "Perez's visitor was Mary McGowan, a retired lawyer from Blankingship & Keith, a longtime go-to firm for Fairfax County Public Schools. In a nearly three-hour interview, Perez told McGowan how she had blown the whistle seven times about the abortion scandal since May 2022, only to be ignored and then retaliated against.",
      "Zenaida Perez, an English-as-a-second-language teacher at Centreville High School in Clifton, Va., says she tried to expose a school social worker who arranged and paid for a student's abortion, but her warnings were ignored.. (Fairfax County Public Schools)",
      "School district officials were \"covering up\" the alleged abortion scandal, Perez said she told McGowan. in the interview.",
      "\"Your recollection is outstanding,\" McGowan acknowledged at one point, according to Perez. Indeed, a detailed review of hundreds of pages of documents, emails and records confirm Perez\u2019s timeline.",
      "Perez told McGowan that she issued her first warning on May 5, 2022, in a meeting with then-principal, Chad Lehman, and an assistant principal. She said that a school social worker had allegedly facilitated and financed a 17-year-old student\u2019s abortion the year before, without her guardian\u2019s knowledge.",
      "Perez said she raised her concerns a second time in\u00a0a letter sent on May 13, 2022, and she met again with Lehman in November 2022 to revisit the issue a third time, confirmed by an audio recording of the meeting.",
      "FCPS policy states that \"every effort shall be made to encourage and support students suspecting pregnancy to discuss their concerns with their parents or guardians.\" However, it does not say FCPS employees should inform parents about those conversations.",
      "\"As this is an ongoing personnel matter, we are not able to comment at this time,\" a spokesman for Fairfax County Public Schools said when asked about Perez's account.",
      "Born in Cuba, Perez migrated to the U.S. in 1990 after earning a master\u2019s degree in teaching English as a second language, often called \"ESOL.\" After teaching at Sarasota Public Schools in Florida, she moved to Virginia, ultimately landing a coveted job as a teacher in Fairfax County Public Schools.",
      "Nearly 20% of students at Centreville High School, in Clifton, Va., take English as a second language. (Fox News Digital)",
      "The high school is \"majority-minority.\" Almost 20% of students are learning to speak English, according to\u00a0school demographic data. About one in four students live in low-income homes and qualify for free or reduced-fee meals.",
      "In the spring of 2022, Perez told the school board investigator she was blindsided when Lehman asked her if she\u2019d given a pregnancy test to a student. She hadn\u2019t, but she did learn that a teen student from Guatemala told her that the school social worker had made an appointment for the student to get an abortion at a Falls Church, Va., clinic in November 2021, and paid the expenses.",
      "In a\u00a0statement written later that fall, the student detailed what allegedly happened when she saw the social worker. \"She helped me with a pregnancy termination, or abortion,\" she wrote, according to a translation from its original Spanish. \"[She] made the appointment for me at the abortion clinic in Fairfax. She paid for the procedure and kept quiet about it, not letting my family know. I was worried that my family would react very badly if they knew about my pregnancy and the abortion.\"",
      "\"When the abortion was performed, I was only 17 years old,\" she concluded. The student and her guardian couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.",
      "Perez told Fox News Digital the student\u2019s guardian, an uncle, didn\u2019t know about the abortion and was \"livid.\"",
      "VIRGINIA SCHOOL DISTRICT ACCUSED OF RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION IN TRANSGENDER LOCKER ROOM CASE",
      "A week after the May 2022 meeting with Lehman, Perez says she sent the then-principal a follow-up email, dated May 13, 2022, reiterating that the school social worker had allegedly helped the student \"solve the pregnancy issue.\"",
      "Perez had another meeting with Lehman in November, a recording of which she shared with Fox News Digital. Perez asked what he had meant when he had previously told her the abortion allegations were \"concerning.\" Lehman responded: \"I don\u2019t remember the statement or the context of it, so I couldn\u2019t answer that question with you right now. I don\u2019t remember there being a conversation about that specifically.\"",
      "She reminded the principal she had repeated her concerns in a letter. When she raised her concerns again about Diaz facilitating an abortion, Lehman responded that he didn't believe the social worker in question would have arranged an abortion for a student.",
      "Julie Perry, a teacher at Centreville High School, recalled how she met Perez for the first time that fall, as Perry stood outside Room 222A on the school\u2019s second floor. It was about 7:45 a.m., as students scurried into classrooms for their first period. Perry had just run on the Republican ticket for state House of Delegates, losing in a district that is majority Democratic.",
      "\"I feel strong. I have truth and God on my side.\" - Zenaida Perez",
      "\"God bless Zenaida for fighting through this,\" said Perry. \"What\u2019s so sad are the higher-ups. They\u2019re not concerned about the truth. They\u2019re concerned about keeping silent about these abortions.\"",
      "On March 7, Perez told McGowan that she raised her concerns again \u2013 now, for a sixth time \u2013 in a Zoom call with Heidi Siegmund, an attorney at McGuireWoods, a law firm based in Richmond, Va., investigating a separate issue of alleged workplace harassment at the school.",
      "On March 19, Siegmund\u00a0wrote to Perez and said: \"We will also make sure the Division Counsel\u2019s office is aware of your concerns,\" according to a copy of the email.",
      "The division counsel\u2019s office has for years hired lawyers from Blankingship & Keith as outside counsel.",
      "In May, Perez says she learned more shocking news: A teen told her that the social worker had offered to help her get an abortion when she was five months pregnant. The teen didn\u2019t have an abortion and is now a young mother, Perez said.",
      "The young mother wrote a statement about her experience, according to a copy of the letter, written in Spanish, saying a school health provider \"gave me the option to have an abortion.\" Perez said the student told her the same social worker had given her the advice.",
      "Last week, as news of her allegations spread, Perez watched in disbelief as the school superintendent, Reid, claimed that school district officials had just learned about the concerns Perez had raised three years earlier and many times over.",
      "Early Monday morning, Perez returned to Centreville High School from summer break, armed with new resolve now that her warnings have been heard beyond Fairfax County Public Schools.",
      "\"I feel strong. I have truth and God on my side,\" she said.",

      "\"In practical terms, the effects of unilateral recognition are quite limited,\" Ben Shabbat said. \"The recognition does not address borders, and, in fact, most of the world has already recognized a Palestinian state when it was accepted as a U.N. observer state (in 2012).\"HAMAS ENDGAME IS \u2018LONG-TERM\u2019 AND IS PLAYING OUT FOR ALL TO SEE AS ISRAEL PUSHES DEEPER INTO GAZA",

Young women haven\u2019t experienced the same trend; they are still significantly likelier to be employed if they have bachelor\u2019s degrees.",
      "The shift in employment prospects for men compared with women is tied partly to the changing dynamics of the labor market, in which much of the job growth has been driven by hiring in the health care and social services industry \u2014 in which nearly 80% of workers are female, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\u201cEssentially 100% of the labor force growth over recent months, maybe even a couple of years, has been coming from the health care industry, and that industry is overwhelmingly female,\u201d said Emerson Sprick, director of retirement and labor policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit that brings together Democratic and Republican policymakers. \u201cWhile at the same time, you\u2019ve seen these traditionally male blue-collar jobs in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, mining \u2014 those have been down or flat. So that\u2019s creating a lot more difficulties for men.\u201d",
      "Tech is among the traditionally male-dominated fields that have been hit particularly hard by layoffs in recent years. Around 132,000 tech industry workers have been laid off in 2025, on top of 238,000 in 2024, according to a tally from the tech job website TrueUp. At the same time, computer science-related tracks have been among the top majors for men graduating with bachelor\u2019s degrees in recent years, adding to the supply of workers amid shrinking demand from employers.",
      "Barcenas did briefly get a full-time job with his computer science degree working as an engineer on brake systems for the auto company Stellantis. He moved to Michigan for the job last summer. But it ended after four months when his entire division was laid off. In the year since then, his only income has come from driving for Uber and doing some video editing projects on the side.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a stable base right now. It\u2019s very rocky, and I\u2019m not sure if I will make it, if the foundation will be good enough in the future or if it\u2019s going to topple over,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the economy, hiring by employers has been slowing, making it particularly challenging for younger workers trying to get their foot in the job market. The economy added just 73,000 jobs in July and fewer jobs than previously forecast in May and June, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In manufacturing, a traditionally male-dominated industry, 11,000 jobs were lost last month.",
      "President Donald Trump claimed this month that those numbers were \u201crigged\u201d to make him look bad and fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\u201cThe Economy is BOOMING under \u2018TRUMP,\u2019\u201d he posted on Truth Social in announcing the firing.",
      "But a booming economy isn\u2019t what some of those on the front lines of trying to find work have been experiencing.",
      "\u201cEvery guy I know that is without a job right now wants to work, but they just can\u2019t get it,\u201d said Eli McCullick, who has been looking for a job for more than a year after he graduated with a degree in sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder. \u201cIt\u2019s demoralizing for guys who really want to get ahead and it\u2019s just not happening.\u201d",
      "McCullick, 23, said he hasn\u2019t even been able to get an hourly job at a restaurant or doing cleaning work at a hotel in the Boulder area, where he\u2019s living at a property his father owns. The only way he has been able to earn money to cover his food and daily expenses has been to do odd jobs for friends and relatives, like shoveling horse manure, mowing lawns and helping an older woman prepare for a yard sale.",
      "After more than a year of looking for work, McCullick decided to pivot to law school, which he hopes to start next year, and he was able to use his personal connections to get a paid internship at a law firm this fall.",
      "The struggle to find work has shifted his political views. He said he voted for Trump last year in hopes that a second Trump presidency would improve the economy and his chances of getting a job. Trump increased his support among younger men in the 2024 election, winning the vote among men under 30 by 1 percentage point over Democrat Kamala Harris, according to exit polls.",
      "But McCullick said he now regrets that vote and fears Trump\u2019s policies around tariffs will raise prices and create economic uncertainty that slows hiring. He said he opposes the recent tax cut and spending bill passed in Congress, calling it \u201ctotally antithetical to the idea of helping Americans\u201d because of its cuts to food assistance and health insurance for lower-income households.",
      "\u201cI voted for him, but I\u2019ll tell you what, it wasn\u2019t because of immigration, it wasn\u2019t because of foreign policy; it was because I bought the big lie about prosperity and economic growth,\u201d McCullick said. \u201cThis was in \u201924 when I was struggling to get a job, and I really hoped that would make it better. But everything he\u2019s done since has done the exact opposite. So I feel disaffected, not only in the job market narrowly, but politically generally.\u201d",
      "Results from an NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey, in April found 45% of young men approved of Trump\u2019s job performance, while only 24% of young women did. The approval among young men was similar to that among the overall population, though lower than among men in older age groups.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said the administration aims to boost the economy by reducing regulations, cutting taxes and working on trade deals to increase American exports.",
      "\"President Trump\u2019s America First policies unleashed historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and this same policy mix \u2014 at an even bigger scale \u2014 is set to deliver again in President Trump\u2019s second term,\" Desai said.",
      "The White House, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pointed to declines in unemployment since Trump took office for men of all ages without a college degree and for men ages 20 to 24 regardless of education. (NBC News' analysis looked at a different group: men ages 23 to 30 with a bachelor's degree and those with a high school degree.)",
      "For decades, men\u2019s employment prospects have been deteriorating while women\u2019s have been on the rise. Since the 1990s, a greater share of women than men have been earning bachelor\u2019s degrees, with nearly half of women ages 25 to 34 holding bachelor\u2019s degrees as of last year, compared with just over a third of men, according to data from the Pew Research Center.",
      "Young men are likelier to be financially dependent on their parents compared with young women, with 74% of women describing themselves as mostly financially independent, compared with 62% of young men, according to a separate Pew survey released last year.",
      "While men are still likelier to be in the workforce than women, men\u2019s participation \u2014 the percentage of men working or looking for work \u2014 has been declining for decades. Now, around 68% of all men are considered to be part of the labor force, down from 69% before the pandemic and 73% before the Great Recession.",
      "Most men who aren\u2019t working or looking for work said in a survey that it was because of personal health issues \u2014 most likely the result of men\u2019s having more physically demanding jobs \u2014 while women\u2019s top reason was caring for children, according to Sprick, of the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a great time for young men to be not doing great in the labor market,\u201d said Richard Reeves, founder and president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, which researches and advocates for men\u2019s well-being. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had these long-term trends in higher education and earnings and geographical mobility that are already pretty troubling.\u201d",
      "Sean Breen, who graduated this spring with a communications degree from California State University, Long Beach, said he and nearly all of his high school friends, both men and women, are back home living with their parents and unemployed. He said even those who went to top-ranked colleges and got seemingly in-demand degrees are unable to find work.",
      "\u201cIt is like a high school reunion,\u201d Breen said. \u201cWe\u2019re all, we are back in Marin County this summer, all unemployed, all trying to find a barista job, a part-time something, because we haven\u2019t found anything.\u201d",
      "After having applied to hundreds of jobs, he said, Breen now plans to go to graduate school in the fall at Trinity College in Ireland, where tuition is significantly lower and, he hopes, jobs will be more plentiful.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want a pity party, but it was so interesting to be in my position and look at all my other peers, as well, and be like, what happened?\u201d Breen said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter what school or degree \u2014 it\u2019s just the current job market.\u201d",
      "The struggles vary by industry, and Reeves said he would like more programs to encourage men to go into health care and break down the gender stereotypes around certain career paths \u2014 similar to efforts to encourage women to go into construction.",
      "\u201cIf health and social care really are where a lot of jobs are coming from and men aren\u2019t in them, we need similar policy responses,\u201d Reeves said.",
      "Barcenas, who graduated with a computer science degree, said he\u2019s open to other fields but would prefer to put this education to use. He worries about pivoting to another career in which he could ultimately be faced with the same uncertainty. For now, he doesn\u2019t know what the future holds.",
      "\u201cIt does mess with me. I get very anxious,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this how it\u2019s going to be when I\u2019m 26, when I\u2019m 27, when I\u2019m 28?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Heartbreaking images of children starving in Gaza have caused what some Jewish Americans call a \u201crupture\u201d between supporters of Israel\u2019s offensive in its current form and those who oppose how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government is managing the war.",
      "Frustrated by the bloodshed, pressure is mounting on the United States and the international community to take better control of chaotic food distribution sites.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing not only divisiveness, but hatred between us, and that\u2019s not a good thing for the future,\u201d said Rabbi Erez Sherman of Sinai Temple, a Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles. \u201cSo how do we not solve it? How do we work on that?\u201d",
      "But support for Israel remains ironclad among many American Jewish groups and rabbis, who argue that Hamas is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching innocent civilians.",
      "\u201cIsrael has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that\u2019s really an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinian civilians who have been caught in the crossfire throughout this entire war because of Hamas\u2019 actions should not be suffering,\u201d she added. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week.",
      "At least 859 people have been killed near sites operated by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, a controversial American- and Israeli-backed organization, the United Nations said.",
      "The foundation's executive director, Johnnie Moore, said Hamas is largely responsible for the killings and dismissed news reports about people dying by Israeli gunfire.",
      "\u201cWe have not seen the Israeli military do anything that remotely aligns with some of these accusations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a quite evident fact that Hamas has killed intentionally probably hundreds of people in proximity not to just our sites, to U.N. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "To address escalating concerns over the humanitarian crisis, synagogues across Jewish movements in the United States have organized roundtables with the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "At an event with GHF hosted last month by Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, reactions were mixed, according to Sherman, the rabbi, who led the discussion.",
      "Some people were shocked that an organization that has come under so much criticism was allowed to present its case. Others appreciated hearing directly from people on the ground.",
      "\u201cHow do you block evil from your midst while also feeding the hungry and supporting the orphan and widow?\u201d Sherman said after the roundtable, referring to Psalm 146. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.\u201d",
      "Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. According to a Pew Research Center report, 53% of Jewish Americans say they lack confidence in his leadership, while 45% say they have confidence. About 6 million Jews live in the United States, or 2% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The poll was conducted in April, before GHF began its operations in Gaza.",
      "Supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. They have also criticized detractors for losing focus on the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas.",
      "\u201cAll of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,\u201d said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "An emerging concern echoed by several organizations and rabbis is that Netanyahu\u2019s position is not creating a safer Israel or global environment for Jewish people. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of nonprofit advocacy organization J Street, said the ongoing violence is exposing Israelis and Palestinians to unnecessary bloodshed.",
      "J Street, which supports a two-state solution, opposed Netanyahu years before the war.",
      "\u201cIf you say to people you must be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel, then we\u2019re condemning ourselves and our kids to a never-ending conflict,\u201d Ben-Ami said Monday.",
      "But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an \u201cexistential rupture\u201d that is pitting friends and family members against one another.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with the very question \u2018Do we belong to each other?\u2019\u201d",
      "Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. He was arrested for investigation of blocking traffic and obstruction, his third arrest since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, he said.",
      "Some posters and signs displayed outside Trump Tower referred to an ancient maxim about the moral obligation to speak out against injustice, Fornari said.",
      "\u201cIt says anyone who has the power to speak out and chooses not to do so is responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "Handcuffed near Fornari was Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization. Jacobs said she supported Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack in 2023, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of 250 hostages. The strike, the worst one-day attack on Jews since the Holocaust, shocked the world.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Jacobs began questioning Netanyahu\u2019s strategy as more and more civilians in Gaza were killed, she said. In July, she denounced American Jewish leaders who had not spoken out against the humanitarian crisis unfolding thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cPrivately, Jewish lay leaders are anguished over Gaza. Publicly, they fear being labeled antisemitic,\u201d she wrote in an opinion column in The Forward, a Jewish American newspaper.",
      "Jacobs has been called antisemitic by other Jewish people who support Netanyahu and shunned by legacy Jewish organizations, she said. Some of it, she said, comes from a legitimate fear of prejudice.",
      "In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. There have also been reports of anti-Jewish slurs and signs at college campuses and pro-Palestinian protests across the country.",
      "The cultural fallout has been playing out in living rooms and across kitchen tables. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.",
      "The group was suspended from several campuses, including Columbia University\u2019s, over allegations it intimidated Jewish students and made them feel unsafe during pro-Palestinian protests last year. Jewish Voice for Peace maintains that its views are not antisemitic.",
      "\u201cIt is not unique in Jewish history for Jews to be in fierce disagreement with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is unique is that there seems to be an effort to weaponize one-half of our community against the other.\u201d"

That is where Sye Savoie is currently based. They are a Marine Corps captain, currently within Wounded Warrior Battalion West, and have served for seven years.",

      "\u201cA lot of the people in my community were Marines. Whether it was people I went to church with or people that were, like, running for city council and they were revered by the population,\u201d Savoie said. \u201cNot only were they revered, it was with good reason. These folks were kind, empathetic, strong, powerful leaders that also led with a graceful hand and I saw that the way my parents and my community turned to them in times of trouble, or for advice, and I wanted to be that rock and that touchstone for my community.\u201d",
      "Savoie shared that they started having conversations with the Marines in their circle and one warned them of the obstacles they would face, at the time, as a woman.",
      "\u201cMy uncle was in the Army for a while, and he knew one of the sergeant majors of the Marine Corps, so when I met with that guy, I was maybe 16 or 17 years old, and we had a really powerful conversation after a church service, and he looked at me, and he said, \u2018Just so you know, being a female in the Marine Corps is going to be the hardest thing you ever do,\u2019\u201d Savoie recalled. \u201cUnfortunately, the joke's on him in that having a gender dysphoria diagnosis and being in the Marine Corps has been the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to do.\u201d",
      "Savoie told NBC San Diego they chose to be transparent about their identity with their fellow Marines when they first transitioned because they felt comfortable doing so, especially during former President Joe Biden\u2019s time in office. However, when President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term in January of this year, that quickly changed."

      "U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of \u201csystematic torture\u201d at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents.",
      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021. A general election is planned for December but faces a widespread boycott by critics who say it will be neither free nor fair."

      "The digitally linked gaggle of leaders \u201cwill address, among other things, further options for exerting pressure on Russia,\u201d the German government spokesperson said, adding that \u201cpeace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security\u201d would be on the agenda.",
      "Most European leaders fear that Russia will not stop at the 20% of Ukraine it currently occupies following its 2022 full-scale invasion, and instead may use this land grab from which to launch further attacks on Moscow\u2019s former Soviet vassals. Putin has described the fall of the USSR as a historic tragedy, and believes the Baltic states, which are now members of the E.U. and NATO, should be brought back within his sphere of influence.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s calls are a show of European unity behind Ukraine and other Russian neighbors who fear its next move. E.U. leaders will hold separate telephone discussions before and after the call with Trump, the latter including Canada, indicating the level of coordination between them.",
      "European powers say that there must be a ceasefire before peace talks can begin \u2014 something rejected by Russia \u2014 and that negotiations cannot happen without Ukraine. They argue Ukraine must have \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d perhaps in the form of Western peacekeepers, so the Kremlin does not use the pause to regroup and attack again."

    "summary": "Amid a wider slowdown, the unemployment rate for men ages 23 to 30 with a bachelor\u2019s degree has jumped to 6% \u2014 compared to 3.5% for young women, NBC News found.",
    "story": [
      "Emanuel Barcenas feels like he\u2019s falling behind. At 25, he\u2019d like to be living in his own place, saving money for the future and making enough money to take a date out to dinner.",
      "Instead, two years after he graduated with a computer science bachelor\u2019s degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology, he\u2019s unemployed and living with his parents in the suburbs of Chicago. Despite having applied to more than 900 jobs \u2014 from secretary positions to a role at a prison \u2014 he has gotten only a handful of interviews.",
      "\u201cI want to be an adult,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to lock in, I need to move forward, but right now, I\u2019m just stunted. I\u2019m trying my best, but I guess my best isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d",
      "Barcenas has found himself in a job market with fewer places for young men, according to economists and recent labor market data. Amid a wider slowdown in hiring, the unemployment rate for men ages 23 to 30 with bachelor\u2019s degrees has jumped in recent months to 6% \u2014 compared with 3.5% for young women with the same level of education, according to data analyzed by NBC News.",
      "Now, young men with bachelor\u2019s degrees are slightly likelier to be unemployed than young men with just high school diplomas, the analysis found. That\u2019s a recent reversal after decades when young men with bachelor\u2019s degrees had an advantage in the labor market, economists said. Young women haven\u2019t experienced the same trend; they are still significantly likelier to be employed if they have bachelor\u2019s degrees.",
      "The shift in employment prospects for men compared with women is tied partly to the changing dynamics of the labor market, in which much of the job growth has been driven by hiring in the health care and social services industry \u2014 in which nearly 80% of workers are female, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\u201cEssentially 100% of the labor force growth over recent months, maybe even a couple of years, has been coming from the health care industry, and that industry is overwhelmingly female,\u201d said Emerson Sprick, director of retirement and labor policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit that brings together Democratic and Republican policymakers. \u201cWhile at the same time, you\u2019ve seen these traditionally male blue-collar jobs in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, mining \u2014 those have been down or flat. So that\u2019s creating a lot more difficulties for men.\u201d",
      "Tech is among the traditionally male-dominated fields that have been hit particularly hard by layoffs in recent years. Around 132,000 tech industry workers have been laid off in 2025, on top of 238,000 in 2024, according to a tally from the tech job website TrueUp. At the same time, computer science-related tracks have been among the top majors for men graduating with bachelor\u2019s degrees in recent years, adding to the supply of workers amid shrinking demand from employers.",
      "Barcenas did briefly get a full-time job with his computer science degree working as an engineer on brake systems for the auto company Stellantis. He moved to Michigan for the job last summer. But it ended after four months when his entire division was laid off. In the year since then, his only income has come from driving for Uber and doing some video editing projects on the side.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a stable base right now. It\u2019s very rocky, and I\u2019m not sure if I will make it, if the foundation will be good enough in the future or if it\u2019s going to topple over,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the economy, hiring by employers has been slowing, making it particularly challenging for younger workers trying to get their foot in the job market. The economy added just 73,000 jobs in July and fewer jobs than previously forecast in May and June, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In manufacturing, a traditionally male-dominated industry, 11,000 jobs were lost last month.",
      "President Donald Trump claimed this month that those numbers were \u201crigged\u201d to make him look bad and fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\u201cThe Economy is BOOMING under \u2018TRUMP,\u2019\u201d he posted on Truth Social in announcing the firing.",
      "But a booming economy isn\u2019t what some of those on the front lines of trying to find work have been experiencing.",
      "\u201cEvery guy I know that is without a job right now wants to work, but they just can\u2019t get it,\u201d said Eli McCullick, who has been looking for a job for more than a year after he graduated with a degree in sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder. \u201cIt\u2019s demoralizing for guys who really want to get ahead and it\u2019s just not happening.\u201d",
      "McCullick, 23, said he hasn\u2019t even been able to get an hourly job at a restaurant or doing cleaning work at a hotel in the Boulder area, where he\u2019s living at a property his father owns. The only way he has been able to earn money to cover his food and daily expenses has been to do odd jobs for friends and relatives, like shoveling horse manure, mowing lawns and helping an older woman prepare for a yard sale.",
      "After more than a year of looking for work, McCullick decided to pivot to law school, which he hopes to start next year, and he was able to use his personal connections to get a paid internship at a law firm this fall.",
      "The struggle to find work has shifted his political views. He said he voted for Trump last year in hopes that a second Trump presidency would improve the economy and his chances of getting a job. Trump increased his support among younger men in the 2024 election, winning the vote among men under 30 by 1 percentage point over Democrat Kamala Harris, according to exit polls.",
      "But McCullick said he now regrets that vote and fears Trump\u2019s policies around tariffs will raise prices and create economic uncertainty that slows hiring. He said he opposes the recent tax cut and spending bill passed in Congress, calling it \u201ctotally antithetical to the idea of helping Americans\u201d because of its cuts to food assistance and health insurance for lower-income households.",
      "\u201cI voted for him, but I\u2019ll tell you what, it wasn\u2019t because of immigration, it wasn\u2019t because of foreign policy; it was because I bought the big lie about prosperity and economic growth,\u201d McCullick said. \u201cThis was in \u201924 when I was struggling to get a job, and I really hoped that would make it better. But everything he\u2019s done since has done the exact opposite. So I feel disaffected, not only in the job market narrowly, but politically generally.\u201d",
      "Results from an NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey, in April found 45% of young men approved of Trump\u2019s job performance, while only 24% of young women did. The approval among young men was similar to that among the overall population, though lower than among men in older age groups.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said the administration aims to boost the economy by reducing regulations, cutting taxes and working on trade deals to increase American exports.",
      "\"President Trump\u2019s America First policies unleashed historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and this same policy mix \u2014 at an even bigger scale \u2014 is set to deliver again in President Trump\u2019s second term,\" Desai said.",
      "The White House, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pointed to declines in unemployment since Trump took office for men of all ages without a college degree and for men ages 20 to 24 regardless of education. (NBC News' analysis looked at a different group: men ages 23 to 30 with a bachelor's degree and those with a high school degree.)",
      "For decades, men\u2019s employment prospects have been deteriorating while women\u2019s have been on the rise. Since the 1990s, a greater share of women than men have been earning bachelor\u2019s degrees, with nearly half of women ages 25 to 34 holding bachelor\u2019s degrees as of last year, compared with just over a third of men, according to data from the Pew Research Center.",
      "Young men are likelier to be financially dependent on their parents compared with young women, with 74% of women describing themselves as mostly financially independent, compared with 62% of young men, according to a separate Pew survey released last year.",
      "While men are still likelier to be in the workforce than women, men\u2019s participation \u2014 the percentage of men working or looking for work \u2014 has been declining for decades. Now, around 68% of all men are considered to be part of the labor force, down from 69% before the pandemic and 73% before the Great Recession.",
      "Most men who aren\u2019t working or looking for work said in a survey that it was because of personal health issues \u2014 most likely the result of men\u2019s having more physically demanding jobs \u2014 while women\u2019s top reason was caring for children, according to Sprick, of the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a great time for young men to be not doing great in the labor market,\u201d said Richard Reeves, founder and president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, which researches and advocates for men\u2019s well-being. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had these long-term trends in higher education and earnings and geographical mobility that are already pretty troubling.\u201d",
      "Sean Breen, who graduated this spring with a communications degree from California State University, Long Beach, said he and nearly all of his high school friends, both men and women, are back home living with their parents and unemployed. He said even those who went to top-ranked colleges and got seemingly in-demand degrees are unable to find work.",
      "\u201cIt is like a high school reunion,\u201d Breen said. \u201cWe\u2019re all, we are back in Marin County this summer, all unemployed, all trying to find a barista job, a part-time something, because we haven\u2019t found anything.\u201d",
      "After having applied to hundreds of jobs, he said, Breen now plans to go to graduate school in the fall at Trinity College in Ireland, where tuition is significantly lower and, he hopes, jobs will be more plentiful.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want a pity party, but it was so interesting to be in my position and look at all my other peers, as well, and be like, what happened?\u201d Breen said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter what school or degree \u2014 it\u2019s just the current job market.\u201d",
      "The struggles vary by industry, and Reeves said he would like more programs to encourage men to go into health care and break down the gender stereotypes around certain career paths \u2014 similar to efforts to encourage women to go into construction.",
      "\u201cIf health and social care really are where a lot of jobs are coming from and men aren\u2019t in them, we need similar policy responses,\u201d Reeves said.",
      "Barcenas, who graduated with a computer science degree, said he\u2019s open to other fields but would prefer to put this education to use. He worries about pivoting to another career in which he could ultimately be faced with the same uncertainty. For now, he doesn\u2019t know what the future holds.",
      "\u201cIt does mess with me. I get very anxious,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this how it\u2019s going to be when I\u2019m 26, when I\u2019m 27, when I\u2019m 28?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In the quiet town of Shawnee, Oklahoma, the rapid whir of sewing machines fills one of the last surviving American garment factories. Inside, denim from 100% American cotton is cut and sewn by hand into jeans, with a \u201cMade in USA\u201d tag stitched into every pair.",
      "Founded in 1903, Round House Jeans is Oklahoma\u2019s oldest manufacturer. Vice President David Antosh, whose family has run the company for over six decades, describes making affordable American-made jeans as both his family\u2019s heritage and a way to support his community.",
      "\u201cOur No. 1 goal here at Round House Jeans is to make affordable American-made jeans that the average American can buy,\u201d explained Antosh, who prices his denim pants at just $70 a pair and says he pays his employees above-market wages. It\u2019s a vision that comes at a high cost and low return.",
      "\u201cOur profit margins are extremely low,\u201d Antosh admitted about his American factory. \u201cWe make hardly any money on these jeans.\u201d",
      "The company embodies a lot of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d economic ethos, but it\u2019s also an example of how hard it\u2019ll be for the president to compel clothing manufacturers to move operations to the United States. Despite higher tariffs intended to reshore manufacturing, scarce and costly skilled labor, limited domestic materials, and outdated technology have made manufacturing overseas both cheaper and more efficient.",
      "Antosh acknowledged he also sells jeans sewn in Bangladesh at far higher margins. He said the higher profits from those imported jeans subsidize the price of his American-made products and pay for his Shawnee factory.",
      "A pair of American-made jeans that Round House sells for $70 carries a 5% margin or less, meaning they cost above $66 to produce. By comparison, apparel retailers typically aim for at least 30% margin on products, according to Anna Livermore, CEO of V. Mora, a fashion consulting firm. Many target margins well above that, she said.",
      "Antosh said his biggest challenge is building his sewing workforce. With so few U.S. apparel companies still operating, experienced workers are hard to find. He trains every new hire from scratch, which is a process that can take months or years before they\u2019re fully productive. \u201cIt\u2019s a very highly skilled job that requires a lot of patience, a lot of learning,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite the above-market pay attracting plenty of applicants, about three-quarters of new hires quit within the first few months, unable to handle the demands of the job.",
      "By contrast, his Bangladesh-sewn jeans, which are still made with 100% American cotton, sell for $40 a pair, nearly half the price of the U.S.-made version, but deliver far higher margins of 20%.",
      "Round House has been hesitant to raise prices on its American-made jeans, both out of principle and fear of the consequences. \u201cEvery time we have a price increase, we hear from customers who say I\u2019d love to buy American-made but can no longer afford it,\u201d Antosh said. He has seen competitors go out of business after price hikes drove customers away. According to a Conference Board survey released Monday, the appeal of \u201cMade in USA\u201d has faded since 2022, as many Americans now link it to higher costs amid higher price sensitivity.",
      "Among the top goals for Trump and his administration in hitting trading partners with steep tariffs is bringing manufacturing capacity back to the U.S., even if it comes at the price of short-term market and economic duress. But Antosh said tariffs won\u2019t help his company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hardship for us,\u201d Antosh said. \u201cWhen jeans sewn outside the U.S. become more expensive from tariffs, we can\u2019t subsidize our American-made jeans as much and their price must go up, meaning fewer customers can afford Made-in-USA.\u201d",
      "Clothing imports already faced tariffs of 12%-17% before Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the United States Fashion Industry Association. An additional 20% reciprocal tariff on Bangladeshi products, which became effective Aug. 7, would chip away at Round House\u2019s profits. But even with the added tariffs, producing jeans in Bangladesh still costs far less than in the U.S. Antosh maintained that even with a hypothetical 100% tariff, Bangladeshi production would still come out cheaper than making the same jeans in Oklahoma.",
      "Only 2.5% of clothing sold in America is produced domestically, according to AllAmerican.org, a U.S. manufacturing advocacy group. The rest is imported from places like China, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, where labor is much cheaper. In the 1990s, U.S. apparel factories employed almost a million people. Today, that number has dropped below 100,000.",
      "The U.S. lacks the capacity, materials and technology to meet fashion companies\u2019 sourcing needs, said Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware. He also sees no clear evidence that tariff policies have driven fashion companies to source more domestically. In his 2025 Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study, over 80% of apparel companies said they plan to diversify sourcing to offset tariffs, while just 17% expect to increase sourcing from the U.S.",
      "Another challenge for U.S. apparel manufacturing is its inability to produce a wide range of goods, said Joseph Ng, CEO of Shift Fashion Group, a consultancy that works with manufacturers. Aside from a handful of luxury brands, most U.S.-made apparel is limited to basic items like T-shirts, hoodies and socks, due to the fact that American factories \u201cdon\u2019t have the skill set, machinery or materials to make anything beyond that,\u201d Ng explained.",
      "Ng pointed to Louis Vuitton\u2019s Texas factory as an example of how brands attempting more complex products face steep challenges. Opened in 2019 during Trump\u2019s first presidency, the luxury brand\u2019s facility produces designer handbags but has a defect rate far higher than the industry norm, making it the company\u2019s worst-performing facility, according to a report from Reuters.",
      "To stay in business, Round House keeps things simple. \u201cWe don\u2019t chase the latest fashion,\u201d Antosh said. \u201cWe\u2019re always about making things very similar to how we always have, even 100 years ago.\u201d Chasing fast-changing fashion trends, he said, would require frequent retraining, making U.S. production inefficient and unsustainable.",
      "Round House\u2019s slim U.S. margins leave little room for error, Ng said.",
      "\u201cIf he only had that business, he\u2019d be one mess-up away from going out of business,\u201d Ng cautioned, noting that garment manufacturing has multiple potential points of failure. A single mistake, such as misplacing rivets on a batch of jeans, could wipe out what little profit there is.",
      "But Antosh said the goal has never been about maximizing profits. His focus is on preserving his family company\u2019s heritage, keeping American manufacturing alive and sustaining his community with good jobs. As a testament to his commitment to his employees, many of his workers have stuck around for decades.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very few factories like ours that still exist,\u201d Antosh said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone else could be making affordable American-made jeans, like we do. That\u2019s our reason for existence.  If we weren\u2019t here, offering it at this price point, who would be?\u201d"

      "It was once an issue that made voters\u2019 eyes glaze over.",
      "But in the last several weeks, the once-arcane subject of redistricting \u2014 underpinned by Texas Democrats\u2019 extraordinary exodus from their state to block Republican plans to redraw maps \u2014 has transformed into the burning hot center of Democratic politics.",
      "Potential 2028 White House candidates have sought to put themselves at the center of the fight against what they call a GOP power grab in Texas. So, too, have a bevy of Democratic governors, members of Congress and candidates for office across the country.",
      "Far from the days of old for a party mocked for sending \u201cstrongly worded letters\u201d while Republicans steamrolled them, Democrats are now firing their own flamethrowers.",
      "It\u2019s precisely what the rank and file want to see from a party they\u2019re fed up with and disappointed in, Democrats say.",
      "\u201cThere are not that many moments when politics break through to normal people. This is breaking through \u2026 because of how ruthless people are seeing Republicans be, and they want to see their Democratic leaders fight just as hard,\u201d said Josh Marcus-Blank, a Democratic consultant who has worked on senatorial and presidential campaigns. \u201cAny [Democratic] voter thinking about 2028 is mad right now, and they really want Democrats to stand up and fight back.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump elevated the issue to the national stage when he said he wanted Texas to carve up its congressional map to create up to five more Republican districts to protect the party's narrow House majority in the 2026 midterms.",
      "While both parties have gerrymandered their states\u2019 congressional districts in the past, the move in Texas stands out because it seeks to rip up the state\u2019s map mid-decade, rather than after the new census every 10 years. Democrats left the state to deny a quorum in the Texas House and prevent the GOP's plan from moving forward. The move ultimately may only delay the action, as Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed to repeatedly call special sessions until he can push through the new map.",
      "But as Abbott moved forward, the heavy hitters of the left moved to get in on the action.",
      "Democrats have already gerrymandered his state to the hilt, but Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, used another route into the spotlight. In June, he quietly discussed a way for Texas Democrats to take refuge in his state on the eve of a legislative special session.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has threatened to pursue a redraw of his state's congressional maps if Republicans move forward with their plans in Texas. Newsom, however, would need to circumvent an independent commission that controls the redistricting process in California.",
      "\u201cThey want to change the game,\u201d Newsom said of Republicans. \u201cWe can act holier than thou. We could sit on the sidelines, talk about the way the world should be, or we can recognize the existential nature that is this moment.\u201d",
      "In another escalation on the issue, Newsom declared Tuesday night that Trump had missed a deadline and so California would be \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201cend the Trump presidency,\u201d he said in a social media post that mockingly emulated the kind of statement Trump would make.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, declaring, \u201cWe are at war,\u201d also said she would look at ways to counter Texas' plans. Any new map in her state wouldn't take effect until after next year's midterms.",
      "Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a possible presidential contender, held a live social media forum and posted a video about the issue.",
      "\u201cWhat it shows is that Republicans believe that they will lose Congress unless they change the maps before the next election,\u201d Buttigieg said.",
      "After Texas Republicans first publicly considered redrawing the map mid-decade, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green took turns teeing off on the issue from the sidelines of the National Governors Association meeting in Colorado in late July.",
      "\u201cMy party can\u2019t stand by and watch it happen and have the Congress taken away from the people\u2019s will, whatever that is. It\u2019s completely unethical for Texas to do this \u2014 to redistrict. It\u2019s an obvious attempt to steal elections,\u201d Green said in an interview. \u201cIf the courts won\u2019t stop it, then you\u2019re going to have to fight fire with fire.\u201d",
      "In Illinois, where a competitive race is underway to replace retiring longtime Sen. Dick Durbin, the leading candidates appeared alongside Texas Democrats at news events. One day, Reps. Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi vowed to build a wall against Trump\u2019s efforts, and the next, it was Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton.",
      "\u201cNow is our time to stand up and fight. President Trump and Gov. Abbott, we are watching you. In Illinois, we don\u2019t sit on the sidelines. In Illinois, we don\u2019t take kindly to threats, and in Illinois, we fight back,\u201d Stratton said before a splay of TV cameras last week. \u201cIf Trump and Texas Republicans won\u2019t play by the rules, we will look at every option available to stop their extreme power grab, and nothing will be off the table.\u201d",
      "Andrew O\u2019Neill, the national advocacy director for the progressive grassroots group Indivisible, referred to some of the Democrats\u2019 remarks and actions as \u201cproductive ambition.\u201d",
      "\u201cDemocratic leadership amongst Democratic voters \u2014 it\u2019s in the toilet right now. The Democratic base is furious with the state of their party,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.",
      "He added that any Democrats hoping to draw attention on the national stage must show the base they know how to take off the gloves.",
      "\u201cIf you take the sort of quiet-adult-in-the-room, \u2018we\u2019re just going to be responsible\u2019 approach, nobody pays attention to you, and nobody hears your message,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all well and good that you put out a boring press release that says you believe in democracy and fair maps, but if you\u2019re not actually taking the fight to Republicans and drawing that strategic conflict, in the attention economy we currently live with, nobody\u2019s going to hear you.\u201d",
      "Hosting Texas Democratic lawmakers in Illinois has given Pritzker a platform to play protector-in-chief, vowing to stand in the way of Trump and Texas officials who authorized civil arrest warrants.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no federal law that would allow the FBI to arrest anybody that\u2019s here visiting our state,\u201d Pritzker said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s a lot of grandstanding. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Newsom and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, stood with a half-dozen Texas lawmakers Friday in Sacramento, where Newsom declared California would \u201cnullify\u201d Texas Republicans\u2019 map if they moved forward.",
      "There are some signs Democrats\u2019 actions are gaining traction. For instance, a new Siena College poll found that Hochul's job approval and favorability ratings have ticked up since June as she has been front and center in the redistricting debate.",
      "Texas state Rep. Ramon Romero Jr., who leads the Democratic Hispanic Caucus and is among those in Illinois sitting out the special session, said he has been emboldened by the public's response.",
      "\u201cPeople have reached out to me that I\u2019ve never heard from,\u201d he said.",
      "Romero relayed feedback his brother, a schoolteacher, has received.",
      "\u201cEvery day, he says, \u2018Man, you know, everybody\u2019s coming up to me, telling me how proud they are of you and for the fact that they didn\u2019t even know what redistricting was and now they know,\u2019\" Romero said.",
      "He continued: \u201cIf we would have just rolled over, nobody would have paid attention. But they know now.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Trump administration released its new, drastically scaled-down version of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released its new, drastically scaled-down version of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report after months of delay Tuesday. The administration\u2019s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year\u2019s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people.",
      "The report also places a new focus on restrictions of freedom of expression by U.S. adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA\u2019s national director of government relations and advocacy, said the Trump administration had engaged in highly selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries.",
      "\u201cWe have criticized past reports when warranted, but have never seen reports quite like this,\u201d Klasing said in a statement. \u201cNever before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration\u2019s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world \u2014 softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.\u201d",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration\u2019s version of the report, which U.S. diplomats have compiled for nearly 50 years under a congressional mandate to measure countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights.",
      "\u201cThe Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIndividual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Europe",
      "In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation \u201cworsened during the year.\u201d The report cited restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of \u201ccrimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\u201d",
      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",
      "Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 election.",
      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

    "story": [
      "In the end, President Donald Trump's offer was one that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser could not refuse.",
      "In mobilizing the D.C. National Guard, pressing federal agents into urban law enforcement and taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 all in the name of fighting violent crime in the nation's capital \u2014 Trump invited Bowser to cooperate with his administration.",
      "The law, federal money and a long-standing threat to repeal self-government in the city lined up behind him, giving Bowser, who one former aide described as having a rare ability to \"remove emotion\" from political and policy calculations, little choice but to comply.",
      "\"What I\u2019m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have,\" Bowser told reporters after a Tuesday meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "That's not to say Bowser is thrilled with the position she finds herself in, effectively handing over law enforcement in her city to a president with whom she has had a complicated relationship since his first term. During a videoconference with Washington, D.C., community leaders Tuesday evening, Bowser described Trump's maneuvers as an \"authoritarian push.\"",
      "But on the whole, her response has been far more measured than those of Democrats \u2014 both in the D.C. area and nationally \u2014 who, less encumbered by practical consequences of a fight with the president, have repeatedly and forcefully hammered Trump\u2019s move and him.",
      "\"The Trump administration has consistently broken the law and violated the Constitution to further the personal and political agenda of a wannabe king,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. \"We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.\"",
      "In a Monday news conference announcing his assertion of power through an executive order, Trump called Bowser \"a good person who has tried,\" adding that he acted because \"she has been given many chances.\"",
      "As Bowser noted during a Monday news conference, the city and federal agencies have a long history of working together to plan, execute and protect special events in the city, including during both of Trump's terms. The two are also largely aligned on the goal of bringing the Washington Commanders back to the city from the Maryland suburbs, and Bowser attended a White House news conference on the topic in May.",
      "But Bowser criticized Trump in the summer of 2020 when he deployed federal law enforcement officers in the nation's capital and activated the D.C. National Guard to combat protests against police violence. Those forces, including the U.S. Park Police, were used to violently break up a peaceful demonstration outside Lafayette Square, just steps from the White House, clearing a path for Trump to walk to a nearby church to address the news media.",
      "In a letter to Trump in June 2020, before officers on horseback drove demonstrators away from the park, Bowser accused him of \"inflaming\" and \"adding to the grievances\" of protesters, creating a more dangerous dynamic.",
      "In order to push federal agents and guardsmen into the streets, Trump declared an emergency in Washington, D.C., even as violent crime rates in the city have been falling.",
      "Bowser is at a disadvantage at a time when her administration is fighting to get Congress and Trump to reverse course on a law enacted this year that froze $1 billion in city money. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in May that he would move \"as quickly as possible\" to fix what some Republicans said was a mistake in the drafting of the law. The Senate passed a change earlier this year, but the House, which is out of session for its August recess, has made no move toward sending it to the president for his signature.",
      "Beyond that, federal law plainly gives the president the power to assume control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for up to 30 days at a time when he declares an emergency, as he did this week, and to activate the D.C. National Guard.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that roughly 850 federal law enforcement officers and agents fanned out across the city Monday night and made 23 arrests on charges ranging from homicide and drug crimes to skipping out on a fare and reckless driving.",
      "Leavitt did not reply to a request for comment on Trump's relationship with Bowser, nor did city spokesperson Susana Castillo.",
      "Justin Bibb, the mayor of Cleveland and president of the Democratic Mayors Association, said in an interview with NBC News that municipal leaders across the country are watching what's happening in Washington \u2014 on the heels of Trump activating the California National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles \u2014 with wary eyes.",
      "\"Absolutely, we're concerned about it,\" he said. \"I want to be very crystal clear about something: We do not want the National Guard in our cities.\u201d",
      "Bibb also defended Bowser's handling of Trump's crackdown this week, pointing to the unusual situation Bowser finds herself in compared to leaders of other major cities.",
      "\u201cShe understands and recognizes that she\u2019s in a unique position where there\u2019s no real statehood in D.C., and her autonomy can be limited, but at the end of the day, she\u2019s going to continue to do the job she\u2019s been doing on reducing violent crime, with or without the support of Donald Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has publicly mused about returning the limited powers of Washington's local government to federal control. Since 1973, the city has operated under a \"home rule\" charter granted by Congress that allows for residents to elect a mayor and city council. But ultimately, the Constitution gives Congress authority to determine the laws of the nation's capital. Though residents of Washington, D.C., pay federal taxes, the city does not have voting representation in Congress.",
      "Declining to directly criticize Trump, Bowser nodded to the city's subservient position during her Monday news conference.",
      "\"He has prerogatives in D.C. unlike anywhere else in the country,\" she said of Trump. \"There are things that, when a city is not a state and not fully autonomous and doesn't have senators, that the federal government can do.\""

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/medicare-part-d-premiums-increase-2026-rcna224592",
    "published": "Wed, 13 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Medicare enrollees who buy the optional Part D drug benefit may see substantial premium price hikes \u2014 potentially up to $50 a month \u2014 when they shop for next year\u2019s coverage",
    "story": [
      "Medicare enrollees who buy the optional Part D drug benefit may see substantial premium price hikes \u2014 potentially up to $50 a month \u2014 when they shop for next year\u2019s coverage.",
      "Such drug plans are used by millions of people who enroll in what is called original Medicare, the classic federal government program that began in 1965 and added a drug benefit only in 2006. The drug plans are offered through private insurers, and enrollees must pay monthly premiums.",
      "It\u2019s not known whether insurers will pursue the maximum increase allowed, as premium prices for next year won\u2019t be revealed until closer to open enrollment, which starts Oct. 15.",
      "Increases are expected to mainly affect stand-alone Part D plans, not the drug coverage offered as part of Medicare Advantage, the private sector alternative to original Medicare. More on that later.",
      "Policy experts say premiums are likely to go up for several reasons, including increased use of some higher-cost prescription drugs; a law that capped out-of-pocket spending for enrollees; and changes in a program aimed at stabilizing price increases that the Trump administration has continued but made less generous.",
      "One thing is surer than ever, say many policy experts: Beneficiaries should not simply roll over their existing stand-alone Medicare drug plans.",
      "\u201cEveryone should shop plans in open enrollment,\u201d said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.",
      "Here are three reasons prices would rise.",
      "1. It\u2019s the spending!",
      "Every year, insurers keep an eye on what they\u2019re spending on drugs so they can build that into their premium estimates. Spending covers both the prices charged by drugmakers and volume, meaning how many people take the medications and how often.",
      "And it\u2019s up. Spending by insurers and government programs for prescription drugs in 2024 across the market grew more than 10%, which is slightly greater than in recent years, according to a research report published last month in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy. Estimates are not yet available for this year\u2019s trends.",
      "Still, in 2024, researchers found that drug prices overall decreased slightly. Spending rose because of drugs coming on the market and increased utilization, especially for pricey weight loss drugs and another category of medications that treat various autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Such increased use is evident in Medicare. Many beneficiaries, for example, are treated for autoimmune conditions. And even though Medicare doesn\u2019t cover treatment for weight loss, many members have diabetes or other conditions that the new weight loss drugs can treat.",
      "The Trump administration, according to The Washington Post, is considering a five-year pilot program in which Medicare Part D plans could voluntarily expand access to the drugs, which can cost more than $1,000 a month without insurance. Details have not yet been provided, but the pilot program would not begin in Medicare until 2027.",
      "Another wild card for insurers is the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on businesses that purchase products made overseas, which could boost drug prices because the U.S. imports a lot of its pharmaceuticals. Much, however, remains unknown about whether drugmakers will pass along any additional tariff costs to consumers.",
      "So, while rising spending is one factor, it isn\u2019t the only reason next year\u2019s premium prices are expected to go up.",
      "2. New out-of-pocket caps for consumers",
      "Changes made to Medicare aimed at helping people with high out-of-pocket costs for expensive medications may be a bigger factor.",
      "Here\u2019s why: Starting this year, Medicare enrollees have a limit on how much they must pay out-of-pocket for prescription drugs. It\u2019s capped at $2,000, a threshold that will rise each year to cover inflation.",
      "Lawmakers in Congress set those changes in the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden. The law also shifted a larger share of the cost of drugs used by Medicare beneficiaries from the federal program to insurers.",
      "That $2,000 cap is a big change from previous years, when people taking expensive drugs had a higher threshold to meet annually and were on the hook to pay 5% of the drug\u2019s cost even after meeting that amount. Those additional 5% payments ended last year under the provisions of the IRA.",
      "Before that law passed, \u201cpeople would spend $10,000 or $15,000 out-of-pocket each year just for a single drug,\u201d Dusetzina said. \u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act was necessary to make Part D proper health insurance, but there\u2019s a cost to do so.\u201d",
      "While the cap is a big help for affected consumers, the reduced amounts paid by some beneficiaries \u2014 coupled with the cost shift to insurers \u2014 could lead plans to spread their increased expenses across all policyholders through higher premiums. A growing number of health plans have also begun to require enrollees to pay a percentage of a drug\u2019s cost, rather than a flat-dollar copay, which can lead to larger-than-expected costs at the pharmacy counter, Dusetzina said.",
      "While consumers not currently taking high-cost specialty drugs may not see a benefit in the $2,000 cap initially, they might one day, say policy experts, who note that drugmaker prices continue to rise and that enrollees could fall ill with a condition like cancer or multiple sclerosis for which they need a very high-priced drug.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to think not just in context of those groups who hit the cap every year, but also people are paying more in premiums to protect their future selves as well,\u201d said Casey Schwarz, the senior counsel for education and federal policy at the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group.",
      "The new prescription drug cap and other changes apply to both the stand-alone Part D drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans. But those Medicare Advantage plans are not expected to increase the drug portion of their premiums, partly because the private sector plans are paid more per member than what it costs taxpayers for the traditional program.",
      "That means Advantage plans have far more money to add benefits, such as vision and dental coverage, which traditional Medicare does not include, or to use them to cushion the impact of rising spending on drug costs, thus limiting premium increases.",
      "Those additional benefits are advertised to attract customers to Medicare Advantage, which also sometimes offers plans with minimal or no monthly premium costs. There are other differences between traditional Medicare and private sector plans. For example, Advantage members must stick to doctors and hospitals in the plan\u2019s networks, and they may face more prior authorization or other hurdles than in the traditional program.",
      "The growing difference between premiums \u2014 fueled by the extra rebates flowing to the private sector plans \u2014 \u201cis increasingly tilting coverage toward Medicare Advantage and making traditional Medicare plus a stand-alone PDP [prescription drug plan] unaffordable for many enrollees,\u201d said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "3. Trump administration reduced funding meant to slow premium growth",
      "The final factor in the premium increase equation is a program set up to slow the rise of premiums in stand-alone Part D plans.",
      "It began under the Biden administration to offset premium increases tied to changes in the Inflation Reduction Act by temporarily injecting additional federal dollars to help insurers adjust to the new rules.",
      "That plan sent just over $6 billion this year to Part D insurers.",
      "And it had an effect.",
      "The average monthly premium for a stand-alone Part D drug plan dropped 9%, from $43 last year to $39 this year, according to KFF, even when factoring in that some plans raised prices by up to $35 a month, the maximum increase allowed under the stabilization plan for this year.",
      "In a memo released in late July, the Trump administration said it would continue the program for next year, while shaving about 40% of the funding. A government official told The Wall Street Journal that the administration felt that keeping the full funding would have mainly benefited the insurers and cost taxpayers an \u201cenormous, excess amount.\u201d",
      "The stabilization effort next year will send $10 a month per enrollee to Part D insurers to help keep premiums in check, down from $15 this year. Among other changes, it allows insurers to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month, up from the $35 allowed this year.",
      "That would be a substantial increase, Cubanski noted, although it is not clear just how many insurers would pursue the full amount.",
      "\u201cWe did see some plans this year were taking premium increases of that $35 amount in 2025, and I fully expect we will see some plans with increases up to $50 a month\u201d next year, she said.",

      "How I picked the best meal delivery services",
      "I consulted with our experts about which features to consider when shopping for meal kit delivery services. Here are the most important ones to remember:",
      "Serving size: Keep in mind how many people you\u2019re looking to feed, and make sure the service offers multiple servings (if you need). A single-serve pre-prepared meal is likely best if you\u2019re only feeding yourself. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, look for a customizable plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings).Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, look for services that offer a variety of options to fit those dietary needs.Customizability: Are you a picky eater or someone who gets easily bored of eating the same meals? Look for meal delivery services that provide a weekly rotating menu with several meal options, as well as customizable features like portion size and the amount and type of protein in each meal.Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services is based on the quality of meals and ingredients, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the specific meal plan. Keep in mind that more budget-friendly services may not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your kit. Most will also let you pause plans or skip weeks as needed.",

      "We\u2019ve tested nearly a dozen meal delivery services, many of which are listed below. To pick the best ones, we looked at the following factors:",
      "Serving size: We considered how many people we\u2019re feeding, and whether the service accommodates multiple servings. For example, a few editors are feeding themselves plus a partner or families, while others are only cooking for one.Prep time: We looked at how long it took to cook or heat up meals, and whether it was worth it for a busy schedule (all of the services we recommend have easy-to-follow recipes and take less than an hour to make, or under 10 minutes to heat up). Price: We tried options across various price points, though most fall within the $10-$12 per meal range.Dietary restrictions: We tried services that catered to different diets, including gluten-free and pescatarian, and how that food actually tasted.Shipping and packaging: We considered how meals are packaged, how that packaging helps (or hinders) meal preparation and whether the shipping is quick, easy and painless.",

      "CookUnity is a favorite among several members of our NBC Select staff. You can choose from multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive per week, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals. The service provides a rotating menu of ready-made options each week, or you can let CookUnity pick them out for you based on your preferences (like your choice of protein) or any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free. You can also flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu.",
      "\u201cI started using CookUnity because I felt like I was spending so much money on groceries but still eating boring food everyday like sandwiches and salads,\u201d says former NBC Select social commerce editor Sadhana Daruvuri. \u201cNow, I can enjoy a variety of delicious meals while still spending about the same amount I\u2019d spent on groceries before.\u201d",
      "NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown is also a CookUnity fan and gets six meals delivered each week, so dinner is taken care of most days. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a time in my life when I am able to cook dinner every night but that\u2019s not the case right now \u2014 I\u2019ve tried switching up how I shop, rearranging my kitchen and meal prepping, all in hopes of cutting down on how much I spend on takeout but nothing worked until I got CookUnity,\u201d she says. Brown loves browsing and picking her meals each week: \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says.",
      "It\u2019s also a favorite of NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin: \u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 the meals show up at my door at the beginning of the week, and knowing all I need to do to cook dinner is pull the wrapper off a meal and warm it up makes my evenings totally stress-free,\u201d she says. However, Malin notes there is some more prep work involved than other services she\u2019s tried. \u201cI did have to take out some components of meals before I microwaved them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was a bit tricky and caused me to do more dishes \u2014 normally, I\u2019d reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in,\u201d she says.",
      "The meals also come in a small reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals come fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days.",

You can also select from a variety of menu options catered to your preferences, including 15-minute meal kits, grill- and oven-ready kits and special occasion meals. Before ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your tastes, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to make. The customizability makes this a standout service for our experts, who emphasize that you can easily choose the amount and type of protein in each meal. Ben Leonard, a chef and food educator with more than 15 years of experience, says the service is best for \u201cfamilies, kids or people with any dietary restrictions\u201d due to its variety of meal selections and customizable features.",

      "Factor is another favorite of mine that I\u2019ve used regularly and love for its varied meal options, quick and easy prep time and detailed nutritional information cards. The service provides a rotating weekly menu of over 30 pre-made meals and caters to a number of dietary needs and preferences, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals to 18 meals per week. Factor also lets you schedule a complimentary consultation with a registered dietitian to answer nutrition questions or determine if a Factor subscription is the right choice for you.",
      "\u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. She especially likes that chefs design the meals but dietitians approve them, and the fact that they don\u2019t cater to just one special diet. \u201cI think a lot of people want to try eating plans like keto and vegan, but don\u2019t know where to begin \u2014 meal options like this let them explore something new without overcommitting and discover if a diet suits their taste preferences, their individual dietary needs and their budget before diving too deep,\u201d she says.",

She says she enjoys the selection of juices and smoothies and the convenience of thawing one at a time.

      "You can customize your weekly meal settings by selecting from six preferences: Quick & Easy, Pescatarian, Family-Friendly, Fit & Wholesome, Veggie and Chef\u2019s Choice/Meat & Veggie. The service appeals to several dietary restrictions, which impressed our NBC Select editors. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by how many HelloFresh meals fit my gluten-free and pescatarian diet, although you definitely have a lot more options if you don\u2019t have dietary restrictions,\u201d says Malin, who tried the service for a week. \u201cOverall, cooking the meals was straightforward and the portion sizes were filling.\u201d",
      "You\u2019ll automatically receive meals that fall under your specific preferences, or you can choose the meals you want each week.

The Fresh & Ready option lets you receive single-serve meals to heat in the oven or microwave in just a few minutes. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to a single plan, the service lets you mix and match with over a dozen meals from its weekly rotating menu.",
      "\u201cSince I follow a gluten-free and pescatarian diet, I can usually only eat one or two offerings off a meal delivery service\u2019s weekly menu.

      "Both Resnick and Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommend Sunbasket as their top choice for healthy meal kits. \u201cIt has a variety of options that can be modified for carnivores and strictly plant-based eaters alike,\u201d says Moskovitz. Most of Sunbasket\u2019s packaging is also recyclable or compostable, using sustainable material like recycled and virgin craft paper and 100% shredded recycled paper filling, according to the brand.",

The service then delivers a kit complete with ingredients and recipe cards for your selections. To me, EveryPlate\u2019s meal options offer variety and fulfill most of my cravings for the week.

Purple Carrot offers both prepared meals and meal kits, so you can choose whether you want to cook or simply heat up your dinner or lunch. In addition to plant-based meals, Purple Carrot provides several gluten-free recipes to choose from, as well as gluten-free pre-prepared meals. After selecting whether you want meal kits or pre-made meals, you can customize the number of dinners you get per week \u2014 these range from two to four meal kits and six to 10 pre-made meals.

In addition to delivering fresh food for the week, it also sends you specific recipes based on the groceries you order.

      "How to shop for a meal delivery service",
      "The biggest factors to consider when shopping include the price per meal/serving, the quality of the ingredients, the amount of time you\u2019re willing to dedicate and your own cooking ability.",
      "The price of meal kit delivery services varies based on several factors, including the quality of meals and ingredients you\u2019re getting, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the meal plan you choose. More budget-friendly services like EveryPlate and Dinnerly will typically cost around $5 per serving, while most other popular services like HelloFresh will cost anywhere between $8 and $11 per serving. If you\u2019re looking at more premium or diet-specific services like Sunbasket and Green Chef, they will cost you approximately $12 to $15 per serving.",
      "Take advantage of trial offers, says Daniel Shumski, a recipe developer and cookbook author. \u201cSo many meal kits and delivery services offer great introductory prices \u2014 it\u2019s worth trying around to find one that fits your taste and budget,\u201d he says.",
      "The time you\u2019re willing to allocate to preparing, cooking and plating your food can help determine which meal delivery service is right for you. If you\u2019re choosing a plan that sends you all the ingredients, you should be prepared to take the time needed to prepare each dish, says Christine Wansleben, owner and culinary director at Mise En Place, which offers cooking classes, private events and more. You\u2019ll also need to ensure you\u2019re cooking the meals as soon as possible since the ingredients can be easily perishable, she adds.",
      "For those who don\u2019t have as much time during the week, ready-to-eat meal delivery services are typically the best option.",
      "Generally, meal delivery services have specific rules and procedures in place to ensure their ingredients are high-quality and trustworthy, according to the experts we talked to. But if you\u2019re extremely particular about the freshness and origin of your ingredients, you should likely skip these services and shop on your own.",
      "For those looking to meet specific nutritional goals, Moskovitz recommends paying attention to the individual ingredients in each meal plan, the nutrition facts and the portion sizes. \u201cDon\u2019t just assume that because it\u2019s homemade or marketed as \u2018healthy\u2019 that it\u2019s the healthiest option for you,\u201d she says.",
      "Certain meal delivery services will offer a variety of options for those with dietary restrictions. However, Resnick notes there\u2019s one caveat: Those with medical issues, such as shellfish allergies or celiac disease, should be mindful of possible cross-contamination.",
      "\u201cCompanies are usually forthright about shared equipment, but eaters with food intolerances should exercise caution,\u201d she says. \u201cThat said, for special diets that are usually choice-based, such as veganism or low carb, I think these services are an excellent choice.\u201d",
      "Before committing to a specific plan, you should consider when you\u2019ll be able to receive these meals to avoid ingredients spoiling or not getting delivered, according to Resnick. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery \u2014 if you know you won\u2019t be there, most services will let you skip a week (but keep in mind there is usually a cutoff time to select this option).",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Meal kits are usually less expensive than dining out or ordering delivery from a local restaurant, according to our NBC Select staff reviewers. However, it all depends on the specific meal delivery service you choose; some are more expensive than others because of premium meal options, organic ingredients and delivery rate, experts say.",

My distance ranges between three and seven miles, and I use a fitness tracker to help guide my pace. I wear a size 10 shoe in a medium width, and generally prefer cushioned shoes with neutral support, as they mitigate knee pains more than other shoes I\u2019ve tried.",

      "Both Cunha and Zach Moxham, a certified personal trainer at Physical Equilibrium in New York City, recommend going to a local running shoe store for the best fit possible. Specialty running shoe stores tend to have knowledgeable staff who can better inform you about running shoe options and recommendations, says Cunha. They also typically have more measuring tools to take advantage of, including foot scans, gait analysis and treadmill analysis \u2014 try everything and anything, says Moxham.",
      "A poor-fitting running shoe isn\u2019t going to be comfortable, no matter how stylish it may look.",
      "If you plan to buy shoes in person, buy them at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, says Cunha. That\u2019s because if they feel comfortable when your feet are most swollen, they will likely feel comfortable throughout the day.",
      "Cunha also says to try on at least three different models of shoe, even two different models at the same time, one on each foot, to get a good feel for the fit.",
      "Pay special attention to the toe box \u2014 the area around your toes, says Cunha and Moxham.",
      "\u201cMake sure there is enough room to slightly wiggle your toes,\u201d says Cunha. \u201cIf you can\u2019t move your toes at all then the shoes are too tight and will eventually become painful. The tip of your thumb should fit between the end of the shoe and the end of your longest toe.\u201d",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Training shoes and stylish sneakers look similar to some running shoes, but functionally, they are very different. Running shoes have a stiffer, more shock-absorbing sole that is suited to higher-impact activity, says Cunha. They also guide your motion to increase stability and the proper alignment of your foot. Plus, running shoes minimize fatigue, as they are lighter than other types of shoes.",
      "Finding the perfect pair of running shoes can be liberating \u2014 I know I like running a lot more when I am doing it in my favorite shoes. But regardless of how attached you get to one pair, it\u2019s important to replace your running shoes every six months or so.",
      "\u201cGood sneakers are designed to last for 300 to 500 miles,\u201d says Cunha. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they still look new: if the support is worn out, you\u2019re at a much higher risk of injury.\u201d",
      "To keep track of when it\u2019s time to replace your shoes, note the date you buy a new pair, and keep track of that six-month interval, says Cunha.",

      "Factor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.",
      "I tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.",

However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.",
      "Cookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown.

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Like their name suggests, prepared meal delivery services have a rotating menu of pre-made meals that you can easily heat up in the microwave or oven minus the prep work (like chopping, slicing and dicing).",
      "These services are great if you lead a busy life and want to cut down on the time you spend cooking per week, or if you simply want a good meal without needing the cooking chops to make it. And since these meals are delivered directly to your door, you won\u2019t have to worry about picking up groceries.",
      "Prepared meal delivery services typically offer a wide range of menu items, so you can try new foods each week or stick with what you like (most will ask you for information about your dietary preferences when you sign up). Plus, many pre-made meal services cater to several dietary restrictions like gluten-free, dairy-free and vegetarian.",
      "One of the most enticing parts of using a prepared meal delivery service is that actually preparing your foods takes very little time. While all services have their own heating directions, they usually require you to heat them up in the microwave or oven for just a few minutes. The services I\u2019ve tried, for example, needed no more than 5 minutes in the microwave and 10-11 minutes in the oven to be fully ready to serve.",
      "Though there are plenty of benefits to a prepared meal delivery services, there are a few downsides to keep in mind:",
      "Most meals are single-serve: Prepared meal delivery services are ideal if you\u2019re only feeding yourself. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, a meal kit service with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) is likely best.You may be sacrificing taste: Though many prepared services have a variety of meal options on their menu that both taste and look great, you probably won\u2019t get the same experience as a fresh, home-cooked meal.",

      "A Minnesota teenager filed a charge of discrimination against a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant Tuesday, alleging a server followed her into the women\u2019s restroom and demanded she \u201cprove\u201d she was a girl.",
      "Gerika Mudra, 18, went to dinner in April with a friend in Owatonna, about an hour south of Minneapolis. When she went to the restroom, a server followed her inside and banged on the stall door while saying: \u201cThis is a women\u2019s restroom. The man needs to get out of here,\u201d according to Gender Justice, a Minnesota gender-equality organization that filed the charge on Mudra\u2019s behalf.",
      "Mudra, a biracial lesbian who isn\u2019t transgender, said that she has been in similar situations before, when people have suggested she\u2019s in the wrong restroom, but that when she tells them she\u2019s a woman they leave her alone. However, when she came out of the stall at Buffalo Wild Wings and told the server, \u201cI am a lady,\u201d she said, the server responded, \u201cYou have to get out now,\u201d Gender Justice said in a statement.",
      "Mudra said she felt she had to prove to the server that she is a woman, so she unzipped her hoodie to show she has breasts. The server didn\u2019t say anything in response but left the restroom, Mudra said.",
      "\u201cShe made me feel very uncomfortable,\u201d Mudra said. \u201cAfter that, I just don\u2019t like going in public bathrooms. I just hold it in. ... I want to be able to use the bathroom in peace.\u201d",
      "Inspire Brands, which represents Buffalo Wild Wings, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Gender Justice filed the charge of discrimination with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, arguing that what happened to Mudra violates the state\u2019s Human Rights Act, which protects people from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, among other protected statuses.",
      "Sara Jane Baldwin, senior staff attorney at Gender Justice, said at a news conference Tuesday that even though Mudra isn\u2019t trans, the server\u2019s actions \u201cwere based on assumptions that she made about\u201d Mudra, and that Minnesota\u2019s law protects against discrimination based on stereotypes or assumptions about protected characteristics like gender identity.",
      "\u201cBusinesses have a legal obligation not to just have antidiscrimination policies on paper, but to train staff and ensure that those policies are followed in real time,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWhen that doesn\u2019t happen, the business is liable for the harm caused.\u201d",
      "Gender Justice said Mudra\u2019s experience \u201creflects a broader climate of fear and suspicion aimed at anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to narrow expectations of what girls and women \u2018should\u2019 look like.\u201d That suspicion has been driven largely by the wave of state legislation targeting trans people, particularly their access to school sports and bathrooms that align with their gender identities, though Minnesota hasn\u2019t enacted any such legislation.",
      "Nineteen states have laws that prohibit trans people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities in K-12 schools, and in many of those states the restrictions apply to other government-owned buildings, as well, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Twenty-seven states prohibit trans people from playing on school sports teams that align with their gender identities.",
      "Even before such laws, trans people had long reported facing harassment in public restrooms and avoided using them as a result. There have been several reports this year of women who aren\u2019t transgender alleging harassment in public restrooms because they were suspected of being trans, including at the U.S. Capitol in January, Phoenix in February, Florida in March and Boston in May.",
      "\u201cThis kind of gender policing is, unfortunately, nothing new,\u201d Megan Peterson, executive director at Gender Justice, said in a statement. \u201cAnd yet, in our current climate we have to ask: What if Gerika had been a trans person? Would this story have ended differently? That\u2019s the terrifying reality too many trans people live with every day.\u201d",
      "Even if Mudra had been trans, she would be able to file a discrimination complaint under state law in Minnesota, which is one of 21 states and Washington, D.C., that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Two states explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation only, and six additional states interpret existing measures against discrimination based on sex to also include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Twenty-one states don\u2019t have explicit protections from discrimination based on gender identity in public accommodations."

      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",
      "Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 election.",
      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

      "The Justice Department accused George Washington University on Tuesday of violating civil rights law by \u201cacting deliberately indifferent\u201d to instances of antisemitism on campus.",
      "In a letter to the Washington, D.C., university following an investigation, the DOJ said that Jewish and Israeli students and faculty were subjected to a hostile environment that was \u201coffensive, severe and pervasive.\u201d Citing clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters last spring and Jewish students, the agency said that the school failed to take appropriate action despite multiple complaints.",
      "The Justice Department gave the school the opportunity to enter into a \u201cvoluntary resolution agreement,\u201d threatening to \u201cproceed with enforcement\u201d if a resolution isn\u2019t reached.",
      "\u201cThe antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking,\u201d said the letter, signed by Harmeet K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general of the agency\u2019s civil rights division. \u201cThe behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and, most importantly, illegal.\u201d",
      "George Washington University spokesperson Shannon McClendon said the school was reviewing the letter",
      "\u201cGW condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in a civil and humane society,\u201d McClendon said in a statement. \u201cMoreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment. \u201c",
      "The letter refers to incidents that took place over a year ago, when students staged pro-Palestinian protests at universities across the country, including rallies and encampments.",
      "Since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, more than 61,000, including thousands of children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "In its letter, the DOJ said that from April 25, 2024, to that May, students engaged in protests including the establishment of an encampment. The department\u2019s investigation found that there were \u201cnumerous incidents\u201d of Jewish students being harassed, with one Jewish student saying that antisemitic protesters ordered them to leave the yard where the encampment was, the DOJ said.",
      "The university\u2019s assistant dean of students then told the student to leave because his presence was \u201cantagonizing and provoking the crowd,\u201d the DOJ\u2019s letter said.",
      "Another student said that they had held up an Israeli flag and was confronted by protestors who linked arms to restrict the student\u2019s movements, the letter said. A nearby school police officer told the student to leave for their own safety. And in a separate incident, another Jewish student who was also holding an Israeli flag said that they were harassed by protesters who yelled expletives at them. Another officer similarly told the student to leave the area, the letter said.",
      "McClendon said that the school took appropriate action, including during the encampment. \u201cWe do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue,\u201d she said.",
      "The Justice Department\u2019s findings surrounding GWU follow a similar announcement in late July over UCLA. The civil rights division also said that UCLA had failed to \u201cadequately\u201d respond to complaints of harassment and abuse toward its Jewish and Israeli students on campus since the Oct. 7 attacks. Days later, UCLA announced that it had been notified that it would be losing federal research funding over alleged antisemitism. Then last week, the Trump administration proposed a $1 billion settlement with the school.",
      "\u201cAs a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,\u201d James B. Milliken, the president of the University of California school system, said in a statement.",
      "Since Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protesters and their schools, debate has erupted over free speech rights and the role of government in academia.",
      "Stanford University\u2019s student newspaper, the Stanford Daily, took legal action against the administration last week over two provisions in federal immigration law that it says officials have wielded against those with pro-Palestinian views, threatening deportation and the revocation of visas. They say in the lawsuit that the situation has led to censorship and violations of free speech rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s real fear on campus and it reaches into the newsroom,\u201d Greta Reich, the Stanford Daily\u2019s editor-in-chief, said in a statement. \u201cThe Daily is losing the voices of a significant portion of our student population.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "It was once an issue that made voters\u2019 eyes glaze over.",
      "But in the last several weeks, the once-arcane subject of redistricting \u2014 underpinned by Texas Democrats\u2019 extraordinary exodus from their state to block Republican plans to redraw maps \u2014 has transformed into the burning hot center of Democratic politics.",
      "Potential 2028 White House candidates have sought to put themselves at the center of the fight against what they call a GOP power grab in Texas. So, too, have a bevy of Democratic governors, members of Congress and candidates for office across the country.",
      "Far from the days of old for a party mocked for sending \u201cstrongly worded letters\u201d while Republicans steamrolled them, Democrats are now firing their own flamethrowers.",
      "It\u2019s precisely what the rank and file want to see from a party they\u2019re fed up with and disappointed in, Democrats say.",
      "\u201cThere are not that many moments when politics break through to normal people. This is breaking through \u2026 because of how ruthless people are seeing Republicans be, and they want to see their Democratic leaders fight just as hard,\u201d said Josh Marcus-Blank, a Democratic consultant who has worked on senatorial and presidential campaigns. \u201cAny [Democratic] voter thinking about 2028 is mad right now, and they really want Democrats to stand up and fight back.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump elevated the issue to the national stage when he said he wanted Texas to carve up its congressional map to create up to five more Republican districts to protect the party's narrow House majority in the 2026 midterms.",
      "While both parties have gerrymandered their states\u2019 congressional districts in the past, the move in Texas stands out because it seeks to rip up the state\u2019s map mid-decade, rather than after the new census every 10 years. Democrats left the state to deny a quorum in the Texas House and prevent the GOP's plan from moving forward. The move ultimately may only delay the action, as Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed to repeatedly call special sessions until he can push through the new map.",
      "But as Abbott moved forward, the heavy hitters of the left moved to get in on the action.",
      "Democrats have already gerrymandered his state to the hilt, but Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, used another route into the spotlight. In June, he quietly discussed a way for Texas Democrats to take refuge in his state on the eve of a legislative special session.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has threatened to pursue a redraw of his state's congressional maps if Republicans move forward with their plans in Texas. Newsom, however, would need to circumvent an independent commission that controls the redistricting process in California.",
      "\u201cThey want to change the game,\u201d Newsom said of Republicans. \u201cWe can act holier than thou. We could sit on the sidelines, talk about the way the world should be, or we can recognize the existential nature that is this moment.\u201d",
      "In another escalation on the issue, Newsom declared Tuesday night that Trump had missed a deadline and so California would be \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201cend the Trump presidency,\u201d he said in a social media post that mockingly emulated the kind of statement Trump would make.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, declaring, \u201cWe are at war,\u201d also said she would look at ways to counter Texas' plans. Any new map in her state wouldn't take effect until after next year's midterms.",
      "Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a possible presidential contender, held a live social media forum and posted a video about the issue.",
      "\u201cWhat it shows is that Republicans believe that they will lose Congress unless they change the maps before the next election,\u201d Buttigieg said.",
      "After Texas Republicans first publicly considered redrawing the map mid-decade, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green took turns teeing off on the issue from the sidelines of the National Governors Association meeting in Colorado in late July.",
      "\u201cMy party can\u2019t stand by and watch it happen and have the Congress taken away from the people\u2019s will, whatever that is. It\u2019s completely unethical for Texas to do this \u2014 to redistrict. It\u2019s an obvious attempt to steal elections,\u201d Green said in an interview. \u201cIf the courts won\u2019t stop it, then you\u2019re going to have to fight fire with fire.\u201d",
      "In Illinois, where a competitive race is underway to replace retiring longtime Sen. Dick Durbin, the leading candidates appeared alongside Texas Democrats at news events. One day, Reps. Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi vowed to build a wall against Trump\u2019s efforts, and the next, it was Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton.",
      "\u201cNow is our time to stand up and fight. President Trump and Gov. Abbott, we are watching you. In Illinois, we don\u2019t sit on the sidelines. In Illinois, we don\u2019t take kindly to threats, and in Illinois, we fight back,\u201d Stratton said before a splay of TV cameras last week. \u201cIf Trump and Texas Republicans won\u2019t play by the rules, we will look at every option available to stop their extreme power grab, and nothing will be off the table.\u201d",
      "Andrew O\u2019Neill, the national advocacy director for the progressive grassroots group Indivisible, referred to some of the Democrats\u2019 remarks and actions as \u201cproductive ambition.\u201d",
      "\u201cDemocratic leadership amongst Democratic voters \u2014 it\u2019s in the toilet right now. The Democratic base is furious with the state of their party,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.",
      "He added that any Democrats hoping to draw attention on the national stage must show the base they know how to take off the gloves.",
      "\u201cIf you take the sort of quiet-adult-in-the-room, \u2018we\u2019re just going to be responsible\u2019 approach, nobody pays attention to you, and nobody hears your message,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all well and good that you put out a boring press release that says you believe in democracy and fair maps, but if you\u2019re not actually taking the fight to Republicans and drawing that strategic conflict, in the attention economy we currently live with, nobody\u2019s going to hear you.\u201d",
      "Hosting Texas Democratic lawmakers in Illinois has given Pritzker a platform to play protector-in-chief, vowing to stand in the way of Trump and Texas officials who authorized civil arrest warrants.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no federal law that would allow the FBI to arrest anybody that\u2019s here visiting our state,\u201d Pritzker said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s a lot of grandstanding. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Newsom and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, stood with a half-dozen Texas lawmakers Friday in Sacramento, where Newsom declared California would \u201cnullify\u201d Texas Republicans\u2019 map if they moved forward.",
      "There are some signs Democrats\u2019 actions are gaining traction. For instance, a new Siena College poll found that Hochul's job approval and favorability ratings have ticked up since June as she has been front and center in the redistricting debate.",
      "Texas state Rep. Ramon Romero Jr., who leads the Democratic Hispanic Caucus and is among those in Illinois sitting out the special session, said he has been emboldened by the public's response.",
      "\u201cPeople have reached out to me that I\u2019ve never heard from,\u201d he said.",
      "Romero relayed feedback his brother, a schoolteacher, has received.",
      "\u201cEvery day, he says, \u2018Man, you know, everybody\u2019s coming up to me, telling me how proud they are of you and for the fact that they didn\u2019t even know what redistricting was and now they know,\u2019\" Romero said.",
      "He continued: \u201cIf we would have just rolled over, nobody would have paid attention. But they know now.\u201d"

      "Despite the company's response, some of Colbert's supporters have pointed to the timing surrounding the announcement.",
      "Just days before the July 17 taping, Colbert called a $16 million settlement between CBS and the Trump Administration a \u201cbig fat bribe\u201d in his opening monologue. The network agreed to the settlement after the White House filed a lawsuit over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d episode with Harris, claiming the interview was deceptively edited.",
      "In response to Trump\u2019s allegations, CBS released a statement in October 2024, saying the claims were \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment,\u201d the network wrote at the time, inviting Trump on the show for an interview during his 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "Then, days after \u201cThe Late Show\u201d announcement, the FCC approved a merger between Paramount Global with Skydance Media. The $8 billion deal went into effect Aug. 7.",

      "Colbert poked fun at Trump\u2019s comments during his Aug. 7 opening monologue, saying, \u201cTo be fair, I think we\u2019re all equally untalented. I just want to say thank you for watching, sir, and thank you for agreeing to be in our new promo.\u201d",
      "In the same monologue, Colbert jokingly opened the door for a new opportunity on streaming, saying, \u201cNetflix, call me I\u2019m available in June.\u201d He later added, \u201cI will also entertain offers from Amazon.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf they were losing this kind of money, you\u2019re telling me losing this kind of money happened yesterday?\u201d he asked rhetorically, directing the question to CBS and Paramount. \u201cThey did not do the right thing. They did not handle Stephen Colbert, the face of the network, in the way he deserves to have been handled.\u201d",
      "Letterman added, \u201cNow for Stephen, I love this. He\u2019s a martyr. Good for him. And if you listen carefully, you can hear them unfolding chairs at the hall of fame for his induction.\u201d",

      "\u201cDora the Explorer\u201d premiered on Aug. 14, 2000, running for eight seasons and quickly became one of the most-watched preschool shows. For over two decades, Dora has crossed social, racial and language barriers, seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+ around the globe and through syndication, according to Nickelodeon.",

Over the years, it's received countless accolades, including an Emmy, Peabody, ALMA, NAACP awards and Television Critics Association awards, among others. She also became the first Latina character to be featured as a giant balloon in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2005.",

      "\u201cThere were a couple of iterations before Dora was Dora. She was Tess. She was almost a motion capture. She had a little mouse that was Boots that lived in her pocket,\u201d Walsh Valdes tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut there were some things that stayed the same throughout, like the essence of her character. We tried to hold on to that.\u201d",
      "Gifford adds that originally Dora was not Latina. They had first toyed with the idea of the lead character being a cat, a bunny or a little red-headed girl.",
      "\u201cAnd when Nickelodeon came to us with this idea of like, \u2018Could you make (the character) Latina?\u2019 Our first reaction was, \u2018Oh, boy, what a great idea!\u2019\u201d he says, noting the growing Latino population in the U.S. \u201cAnd the representation is not there on air.\u201d",
      "The two and their teams recall bringing in Latino writers, cultural content supervisors like Carlos Cort\u00e9s, experts in language, in music and dance, as well as traveling to Latin America to immerse themselves in the culture.",
      "They noted that when they connected with \u201cseasoned writer\u201d Eric Weiner, he brought on a whole new perspective.",
      "\u201cAnd in doing that, I think that\u2019s when the character came to be who she was,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cBecause it was about using a second language to make friends, to solve problems, to build bridges.\u201d",
      "When the pilot came out, Walsh Valdes and Gifford shared it with a group of children to get their reactions.",
      "\u201cThey went bonkers,\u201d Walsh Valdes recalls. \u201cWhen the executives saw kids screaming and shouting and playing backpack and stuff, all resistance melted away.\u201d",

      "\u201cDora was such a big part of my childhood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional to even have the opportunity to do this. I feel so blessed and it\u2019s amazing to see Diana (Zerme\u00f1o) take on such an iconic role.\u201d",
      "The new voice of Dora, Diana Zerme\u00f1o, also told TODAY that she grew up watching \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d because when she was younger, she didn\u2019t speak a lot of English.",
      "\u201cSo it was really nice to have a show where the main character also spoke Spanish and I didn\u2019t have to put the dubbing on,\u201d the young actor said.",
      "There\u2019s also been a slew of spin-offs, including \u201cGo, Diego! Go!\u201d which follows Dora\u2019s cousin, Diego, and his friend, Jaguar, as well as \u201cDora and Friends: Into the City!\u201d",

      "The 24-year-old actor adds that Dora reminds \u201cpeople to be young and have curiosity. She\u2019s an explorer, she has curiosity. That\u2019s what Dora taught me: to ask questions, and always be on the lookout to make the most out of every situation.\u201d",
      "Most recently, the Latina heroine was brought to life by Samantha Lorrain in the new live-action film, \u201cDora and the Search for Sol Dorado,\u201d which debuted July 2 on Paramount+ and Nickelodeon.",

      "And for many newer generations that is true. With 25 years of Dora, kids who grew up watching \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d are now sharing the show with their children.",
      "\u201cThis is maybe the third generation of \u2018Dora\u2019 fans.

It\u2019s like being a proud parent. I\u2019m so happy that this gets to continue and spread.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., as a Latina, Spanish is seen as her \u201csuperpower,\u201d Gifford says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seen as a way to problem solve, as a way to make friends, as a way to build bridges and achieve your goals,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important and I think it sends a really good message.\u201d",
      "While Dora's Spanish lessons are known in the U.S., Doras around the world teach English. Still, the message of adventure, friendship and authenticity stays the same.",
      "\u201cSomehow that little girl resonated in a really strong way, and continues to in all the different iterations that Dora takes. There\u2019s something timeless about that,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cI think it has to do with being open to all people. There\u2019s an acceptance that Dora shows. She\u2019s always true to who she is.\u201d",
      "The creators add that there are so many universals to Dora, \u201ccertainly bilingualism in other parts of the world is very accepted.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeeing a character move between two languages isn\u2019t so unusual for them,\u201d Walsh Valdes notes. \u201cBut having that magic backpack... was a game changer.\u201d",
      "The love for Dora may be universal and for the creators and stars, they have felt it deeply.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I understood the impact and the importance of the show as a kid as much as I do now,\u201d Herles told TODAY. \u201cTo hear everyone\u2019s stories of their memories of the show, with tears in their eyes and telling me how much they loved the show, how much the show meant, it really brings a new perspective to what I did and what I brought to life.\u201d",
      "Dora will always be needed, the creators say, explaining, \u201cShe is so loving and accepting and she really connects with the viewer and listens to the viewer.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cWith all the noise out there, she is a break from that, and it makes a little kid feel like they\u2019re heard, they\u2019re special.\u201d"

    "summary": "Taylor Swift announced her 12th album \"The Life of a Showgirl\" but has kept the release date secret. Fans are using Easter eggs and numerology to predict when it drops.",
    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift sent fans into overdrive last night when she announced her 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d while appearing on Jason and Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast, \u201cNew Heights.\u201d",
      "But the pop superstar left fans with more questions than answers,specifically: When will the album actually drop?",
      "In the clip, which dropped at 12:12 a.m. on Aug. 12, Swift brought out a briefcase emblazoned with an orange \u201cT.S.\u201d before pulling out a blurred vinyl record.",
      "\u201cSo I wanted to show you something,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my brand new album, \u2018The Life of a Showgirl.\u2019\u201d",
      "While vinyl, cassette, CD and official posters are available for pre-order on her website, which will ship before Oct. 13, 2025, Swift made it clear that this is not the official release date for her upcoming album. A disclaimer on her website reads, \u201cThis is not the release date, official release date to be announced.\"",
      "The mystery deepens with all album artwork remaining blurred and locked behind an orange padlock, with another cryptic message promising the \"album artwork and unique CD design to be revealed at a later date.\"",
      "Swift also changed her Instagram profile picture to the same image of this orange padlock.",
      "But Swifties are already hard at work decoding potential clues regarding the release of the album.",
      "Some fans believe they spotted hints as far back as 10 months ago, when Swift posted an Instagram video of herself walking through Miami's Hard Rock Stadium ahead of another The Eras Tour show. As she walks, her cat in her arms, she briefly passes a sign reading \"A12,\" potentially hinting at her Aug. 12 announcement.",
      "Fans are also claiming that she teased \"Life of a Showgirl\" in her \"The Eras Tour\" book. The final chapter of this book is called \"Behind the Scenes,\" and is a similar orange hue as all of the new album art teasers that have been revealed so far.",
      "With the official release date of TS12 still under wraps, fan theories are running wild on social media. One elaborate TikTok theory has gained traction, analyzing the pattern of Swift\u2019s past album releases, all of which dropped on consecutive October dates:",
      "Oct. 21, 2022: \"Midnights\"",
      "Oct. 21, 2022: \"Midnights\"",
      "Oct. 22, 2012: \"Red\"Oct. 24, 2006: \"Taylor Swift\"Oct. 25, 2010: \"Speak Now\"Oct. 27, 2014: \"1989\"",
      "Oct. 22, 2012: \"Red\"",
      "Oct. 24, 2006: \"Taylor Swift\"",
      "Oct. 25, 2010: \"Speak Now\"",
      "Oct. 27, 2014: \"1989\"",
      "Another TikToker used Swift's well-documented love of the number 13 and red hue symbolism in her music. The theory hinges on track two from her fourth album (\"Red\" from Red) and tenth album (\"Maroon\" from Midnights) both related to shades of red.",
      "Eagle-eyed fans noticed two missing dates in this sequence: October 23 and October 26, leading many to speculate that \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d could fill one of these gaps.",
      "If the pattern continues with TS12's second track also being red-themed, the TikToker came up with a math equation that seemingly hints that Oct. 26 is when TS12 could drop. \"So all track twos on her 4th, 10th, and 12th album would be shades of red,\" the TikToker wrote. \"What\u2019s 4+10+12? 26\u202626/2 is 13!!!!\u201d",
      "However, other fans are speculating the album could drop before the Oct. 13 shipping date for physical items, with one theory suggesting Friday, Oct. 10.",
      "While it remains unclear whether these theories have any truth to them, one thing is certain: Swift has once again proven her mastery at keeping fans engaged, guessing and obsessed with every possible clue."

      "Atkinson joined the cast of \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful\u201d in 2019 and last appeared as Thomas, the son of Ridge Forrester and Taylor Hayes, in 2024.",
      "Thomas was a bit of a divisive character and struggled with his mental health off and on during his tenure on the show. His love for Hope turned into an obsession at times, and their relationship had plenty of bumps in the road.",
      "Hope became a mother figure to Thomas' son, Douglas, and Thomas was eager to marry her once her marriage to Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) fell apart. Still, Hope wasn't ready to dive back into another serious relationship just yet.",
      "Thomas quickly grew impatient with Hope and moved on with another woman, Paris Buckingham (Diamond White), much to Hope's surprise. When viewers last saw Thomas on screen, he had returned to town for a quick visit with Paris and Douglas.",
      "Since then, Hope has found love with Carter Walton (Lawrence Saint-Victor), so a surprise appearance from Thomas would certainly shake things up."

      "Platt performed the cover at the Las Culturistas Culture Awards, which aired Aug. 5 on Bravo, and fans quickly became obsessed with the heartfelt string arrangement of Rae\u2019s whispery pop anthem.",
      "Bowen Yang, one of the co-hosts of the culture awards, tells TODAY.com that Platt was \u201con board\u201d to be at the ceremony, and that he and his co-host Matt Rogers knew Platt \u201cdoing anything \u2014 a presenting bit, a comedy bit, a song, whatever \u2014 was gonna be gold, no matter what.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe is very busy on her amazing tour. She can tune out the rest of the world, especially us, if that\u2019s what\u2019s best for her,\u201d Yang says. \u201cWe obviously just wanted to make her proud.\u201d"

After years of navigating a romance in the public eye, the Kansas City Chiefs star is revealing how the two manage to both enjoy their moments in the spotlight.",

      "The 35-year-old athlete, who is the magazine\u2019s September cover star, continued. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of the music. I\u2019m a fan of art. And it\u2019s so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field. I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou can\u2019t block that (attention) out,\u201d he says about the added scrutiny. \u201cIf someone says something that they don\u2019t like about you, you have to be able to understand how you are portraying yourself for them to say that.\u201d",
      "He hears the comments from vocal critics, and they affect him.",
      "Kelce adds, \u201cI\u2019m a guy who doesn\u2019t want anyone to say anything negative about me. Some people don\u2019t give a f\u2014. I\u2019m someone who does care.\u201d The three-time Super Bowl champion wants to be respected, on and off the field.",
      "\u201cI do want people to look at me like I\u2019m doing good in the world. I\u2019m influencing and being somebody that has done it the right way,\u201d he said.",
      "His comments come as Kelce looks to leave behind a summer of jet-setting with Swift and focus on the start of the 2025 NFL season. In July, he gave fans a glimpse into what the couple has been up to this offseason.",
      "He shared a lengthy slideshow on Instagram July 24 that featured multiple photos with Swift, marking the first time he posted pictures of her on his page.",
      "In one photo, he sported a \u201cCaptain\u201d hat while she wore one that read \u201cFirst mate.\u201d Other pictures showed the two enjoying a cozy dinner in a restaurant and playing hockey. \u201cHad some adventures this offseason, kept it 100,\u201d he captioned the post."

    "summary": "What is the Hamilton trend that is taking over TikTok and why are people crawling out of their windows?",
    "story": [
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda's \"Hamilton\" has spent a decade on Broadway and in theaters around the world. Now, a new version of the musical is playing out ... on TikTok.",
      "A \"Hamilton\"-inspired social media trend is more concerned with the founding father\u2019s subpar husband skills than with he changed the United States' trajectory.",
      "The trend involves people, usually women, dressing up like Hamilton \u2014 complete with hand-drawn facial hair and a lantern \u2014 and attempting to sneak away to the tune of the soundtrack\u2019s \u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy does everyone just casually have a founding father outfit?\u201d said one commenter, asking what much of the internet is likely thinking.",
      "This song captures the moment when Hamilton is leaving for New Jersey to duel his longtime enemy, Aaron Burr. During the sound clip, Eliza asks Hamilton to stay and come back to bed with her. Hamilton protests that he has a meeting at dawn. In the show, this is a tragic interaction, taking place right before Hamilton meets his end.",
      "For TikTok, this song is a perfect moment to highlight Hamilton\u2019s deficiencies as a husband. Hamilton, yet again, is prioritizing his career and reputation over his family ... and it leads to his death.",
      "The trend started in July, when TikTok user @actuallyHamilton posted a recreation of the scene while lip-synching halfway out a window.",
      "From then, the trend has taken off. The internet's new group of \"Hamiltons\" have found other methods of escaping, like a shower window, doggy door, barely open garage door, kayak (and another kayak) and even a washing machine. One throws a suitcase out of a window before trying to leave themselves. Another creative video was filmed entirely on a Nest cam footage.",
      "\u201cSuddenly the implication of this trend that Hamilton has to sneak out of his own home through a window is KILLING me,\u201d reads one comment.",
      "Stephanie Gonzalez, speaking to TODAY.com, said she was \u201cso excited\u201d when she saw the trend: \u201cI had the perfect jacket.\u201d She and her fianc\u00e9 have filmed a series of videos.",
      "\u201cIt is probably the most fun we have had. If someone is looking for a good date night idea, try re-creating these videos,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "One thing remains consistent across the videos: Hamilton is fed up with Eliza\u2019s clinginess. TikToker\u2019s facial expressions paint a version of Hamilton as the opposite of a family man. The delivery of Hamilton\u2019s \u201cI know\u201d is always particularly sharp, as is the \u201cshh.\u201d",
      "The dark side to Hamilton's personality also comes through in re-creations of other moments from the musical, like when Eliza asks Hamilton to pay attention to their son\u2019s birthday in \"Take a Break.\" When their son Philip raps in the musical, Miranda\u2019s Hamilton looks amused, but on in the social media parodies he\u2019s always slightly annoyed and disgusted.",

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday hinted that ceasefire efforts in Gaza are now focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages all at once, rather than in phases.",
      "Arab officials told The Associated Press last week that mediators Egypt and Qatar were preparing a new framework for a deal that would include the release of all remaining hostages in one go in return for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "The long-running indirect talks appeared to break down last month. But a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for ceasefire talks on Tuesday, Egypt\u2019s state-run Qahera news channel reported, a sign that efforts have not been abandoned after 22 months of war.",
      "Israel has threatened to widen its military offensive against Hamas to the areas of Gaza that it does not yet control, and where most of the territory\u2019s 2 million residents have sought refuge.",
      "Those plans have sparked international condemnation and criticism within Israel, and could be intended to raise pressure on Hamas to reach a ceasefire. The militants still hold 50 hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war. Israel believes around 20 of them are alive.",
      "\u2018I want all of them\u2019",
      "In an interview with Israel\u2019s i24 News network broadcast Tuesday, Netanyahu was asked if the window had closed on a partial ceasefire deal. Egyptian Foreign Ministry Badr Abdelatty told reporters that Cairo is still trying to advance an earlier proposal for an initial 60-day ceasefire, the release of some hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid before further talks on a lasting truce.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s behind us,\u201d Netanyahu replied. \u201cWe tried, we made all kinds of attempts, we went through a lot, but it turned out that they were just misleading us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want all of them,\u201d he said of the hostages. \u201cThe release of all the hostages, both alive and dead \u2014 that\u2019s the stage we\u2019re at.\u201d",
      "He added, however, that Israel\u2019s demands haven\u2019t changed, and that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas has surrendered. He has said that even then, Israel will maintain open-ended security control over the territory.",
      "Hamas has long called for a comprehensive deal but says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The militant group has refused to lay down its arms, as Israel has demanded.",
      "U.N. warns about starvation, malnutrition",
      "The United Nations on Tuesday warned that starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric reported the warning from the World Food Program and said Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry told U.N. staff in Gaza that five people died over the last 24 hours from malnutrition and starvation.",
      "The ministry says 121 adults and 101 children have died of malnutrition-related causes during the war.",
      "\u201cAgainst this backdrop, humanitarian supplies entering Gaza remain far below the minimum required to meet people\u2019s immense needs,\u201d Dujarric said.",
      "The U.N. and its humanitarian partners are doing everything possible to bring aid into Gaza, he said, but still face significant delays and impediments from Israeli authorities that prevent the delivery of food and other essentials at the scale needed.",
      "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in that 2023 attack. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive has since displaced most of Gaza\u2019s population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. It has killed more than 61,400 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.",
      "The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "Israel says it struck militants disguised as aid workers",
      "In a separate development, the Israeli military said it recently struck a group of militants in Gaza who were disguised as aid workers and using a car with the logo of international charity World Central Kitchen.",
      "The army said it carried out an airstrike on the men after confirming with the charity that they were not affiliated with it and that the car did not belong to it.",
      "World Central Kitchen confirmed that the men and the vehicle were not affiliated with it. \u201cWe strongly condemn anyone posing as World Central Kitchen or other humanitarians, as this endangers civilians and aid workers,\u201d it said in a statement.",

      "But support for Israel remains ironclad among many American Jewish groups and rabbis, who argue that Hamas is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching innocent civilians.",
      "\u201cIsrael has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that\u2019s really an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinian civilians who have been caught in the crossfire throughout this entire war because of Hamas\u2019 actions should not be suffering,\u201d she added. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week.",
      "At least 859 people have been killed near sites operated by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, a controversial American- and Israeli-backed organization, the United Nations said.",
      "The foundation's executive director, Johnnie Moore, said Hamas is largely responsible for the killings and dismissed news reports about people dying by Israeli gunfire.",
      "\u201cWe have not seen the Israeli military do anything that remotely aligns with some of these accusations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a quite evident fact that Hamas has killed intentionally probably hundreds of people in proximity not to just our sites, to U.N. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "To address escalating concerns over the humanitarian crisis, synagogues across Jewish movements in the United States have organized roundtables with the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "At an event with GHF hosted last month by Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, reactions were mixed, according to Sherman, the rabbi, who led the discussion.",
      "Some people were shocked that an organization that has come under so much criticism was allowed to present its case. Others appreciated hearing directly from people on the ground.",
      "\u201cHow do you block evil from your midst while also feeding the hungry and supporting the orphan and widow?\u201d Sherman said after the roundtable, referring to Psalm 146. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.\u201d",
      "Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. According to a Pew Research Center report, 53% of Jewish Americans say they lack confidence in his leadership, while 45% say they have confidence. About 6 million Jews live in the United States, or 2% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The poll was conducted in April, before GHF began its operations in Gaza.",
      "Supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. They have also criticized detractors for losing focus on the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas.",
      "\u201cAll of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,\u201d said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "An emerging concern echoed by several organizations and rabbis is that Netanyahu\u2019s position is not creating a safer Israel or global environment for Jewish people. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of nonprofit advocacy organization J Street, said the ongoing violence is exposing Israelis and Palestinians to unnecessary bloodshed.",
      "J Street, which supports a two-state solution, opposed Netanyahu years before the war.",
      "\u201cIf you say to people you must be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel, then we\u2019re condemning ourselves and our kids to a never-ending conflict,\u201d Ben-Ami said Monday.",
      "But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an \u201cexistential rupture\u201d that is pitting friends and family members against one another.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with the very question \u2018Do we belong to each other?\u2019\u201d",
      "Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. He was arrested for investigation of blocking traffic and obstruction, his third arrest since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, he said.",
      "Some posters and signs displayed outside Trump Tower referred to an ancient maxim about the moral obligation to speak out against injustice, Fornari said.",
      "\u201cIt says anyone who has the power to speak out and chooses not to do so is responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "Handcuffed near Fornari was Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization. Jacobs said she supported Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack in 2023, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of 250 hostages. The strike, the worst one-day attack on Jews since the Holocaust, shocked the world.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Jacobs began questioning Netanyahu\u2019s strategy as more and more civilians in Gaza were killed, she said. In July, she denounced American Jewish leaders who had not spoken out against the humanitarian crisis unfolding thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cPrivately, Jewish lay leaders are anguished over Gaza. Publicly, they fear being labeled antisemitic,\u201d she wrote in an opinion column in The Forward, a Jewish American newspaper.",
      "Jacobs has been called antisemitic by other Jewish people who support Netanyahu and shunned by legacy Jewish organizations, she said. Some of it, she said, comes from a legitimate fear of prejudice.",
      "In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. There have also been reports of anti-Jewish slurs and signs at college campuses and pro-Palestinian protests across the country.",
      "The cultural fallout has been playing out in living rooms and across kitchen tables. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.",
      "The group was suspended from several campuses, including Columbia University\u2019s, over allegations it intimidated Jewish students and made them feel unsafe during pro-Palestinian protests last year. Jewish Voice for Peace maintains that its views are not antisemitic.",
      "\u201cIt is not unique in Jewish history for Jews to be in fierce disagreement with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is unique is that there seems to be an effort to weaponize one-half of our community against the other.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe war being waged in Gaza is exacting an unbearable toll from hostages who have languished in captivity for 676 days, is risking our soldiers\u2019 lives in vain, is causing unnecessary harm to innumerable innocent civilians, and is degrading Israel\u2019s standing in the world to an unprecedented low,\u201d it added on Sunday.",
      "The statement \u2014 which was the first time the group had explicitly called for an end to the conflict \u2014 was issued as Palestinians continued dying from both Israeli fire and hunger.",
      "Families of hostages were, meanwhile, growing increasingly desperate.",
      "\u201cThe decision to send the army deeper into Gaza is a danger to my husband, Omri,\u201d Lishay Miran-Lavi, wife of hostage Omri Miran, told a news conference Sunday as Netanyahu defended a previously unannounced operation in the besieged and bombarded Palestinian enclave.",
      "Calling on Israel\u2019s largest companies, trade unions and the tech sector to strike, she said they should \u201cstop everything in order to save our hostages and our soldiers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy husband and the other hostages are facing extreme danger,\u201d Miran-Lavi added.",
      "Hamas, other militants and Palestinian civilians seized about 250 hostages during the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. Of the 50 hostages who remain in Gaza, about 20 are believed to be alive.",
      "The families have called for the strike to take place Sunday, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The Israeli security Cabinet had approved the destruction of Hamas strongholds in the \u201ccentral camps\u201d and Al-Mawasi, In addition to Gaza City, Netanyahu said Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe timeline that we set for the action is fairly quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want, first of all, to enable safe zones to be established so the civilian population of Gaza City can move out.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s goal was not to stay in Gaza \u2014 just free it of Hamas, Netanyahu added.",
      "\u201cWe have two remaining strongholds, OK? These are Gaza City and the central camps and Mawasi,\u201d he said.",
      "According to the United Nations, the camps are housing more than a half-million Palestinians displaced during Israel\u2019s military campaign triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7  terrorist attack, in which 1,200 people were killed.",
      "The goals, he said, included demilitarizing the entire Palestinian territory, with the Israeli military having \u201coverriding security control\u201d but a non-Israeli civilian administration taking charge.",
      "He also continued to deny there was starvation in Gaza, claiming the situation is being exaggerated. \u201cNo one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war\u201d if Israel was implementing a \u201cstarvation policy,\u201d Netanyahu said.",
      "More than 200 Palestinians have died from extreme malnutrition in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, even as Israel allows more aid to trickle into the territory.",
      "According to local health officials, more than 61,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, have been killed since Israel began its military campaign Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack.",
      "World leaders also condemned Netanyahu\u2019s new plan at an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting.",
      "\u201cExpanding military operations will only endanger the lives of all civilians in Gaza, including the remaining hostages, and result in further unnecessary suffering,\u201d Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia and Britain said in a joint statement. \u201cThis is a manmade crisis, and therefore urgent action is needed to halt starvation and to surge aid into Gaza.\u201d",
      "Later Sunday, Al Jazeera said five of its staff members \u2014 Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa \u2014 were killed \u201cin a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military said that al-Sharif was \u201cthe head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.\u201d",
      "Al-Sharif and the Qatar-owned broadcaster have previously denied accusations that he was a terrorist."

      "DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 It\u2019s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth \u2014 a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record.",
      "But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible \u201cillicit international trafficking,\u201d claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:",
      "How it was found",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth.",
      "It was discovered in the Sahara in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.",
      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private galley in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction.",
      "Why Niger is investigating",
      "Following the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.",
      "Niger\u2019s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite\u2019s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \u201cakin to illicit international trafficking.\u201d",
      "Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of \u201cprecious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide\u201d in an effort to ensure their traceability.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement sent to The Associated Press the meteorite was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.",
      "\u201cAs with everything we sell, all necessary documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved.\u201d the statement read.",
      "Authorities in Niger did not respond to AP questions.",
      "What international law says",
      "Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property \u2014 which Niger and the U.S. have ratified \u2014 rare minerals, like meteorites, can qualify as cultural property.",
      "However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,\u201d she told the AP.",
      "Paul Sereno, a paleontologist who has spent years uncovering dinosaur fossils in Niger\u2019s Sahara, is campaigning to return the country\u2019s cultural and natural heritage \u2014 including meteorites.",
      "\u201cWhen you have laws that clearly say rare minerals like meteorites are cultural artifacts, you cannot simply come in an take something that is so unique and valuable to a country,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just not in the colonial area anymore,\u201d he added.",
      "Some countries, like Morocco, one of the leading sources of meteorites on the international market, require restitution if the objects are discovered on their territory. But enforcement has been challenging due to the vast desert areas and informal trading networks."

      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021. A general election is planned for December but faces a widespread boycott by critics who say it will be neither free nor fair."

The administration\u2019s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year\u2019s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people.",
      "The report also places a new focus on restrictions of freedom of expression by U.S. adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA\u2019s national director of government relations and advocacy, said the Trump administration had engaged in highly selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries.",
      "\u201cWe have criticized past reports when warranted, but have never seen reports quite like this,\u201d Klasing said in a statement. \u201cNever before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration\u2019s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world \u2014 softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.\u201d",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration\u2019s version of the report, which U.S. diplomats have compiled for nearly 50 years under a congressional mandate to measure countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights.",
      "\u201cThe Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIndividual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Europe",
      "In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation \u201cworsened during the year.\u201d The report cited restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of \u201ccrimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\u201d",
      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",

      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

      "Advanced units have pushed farther into Ukrainian-held territory in the Donetsk region, creating two narrow, 10-mile prongs near the battlefield hot spot town of Pokrovsk, according to watchdogs including Ukraine's Deep State and Washington's Institute for the Study of War, two of the top open-source teams tracking the war's battlefield developments.",
      "Expert observers supportive or at least sympathetic to Kyiv are deeply worried that these forays could expand into a full-scale breakthrough for the Kremlin.

      "Though small, the Russian breakthroughs represent a far quicker land grab than either side has managed in months. The concern for Ukraine is that Russia would be able to expand outward into poorly defended parts of Donetsk. The advance may have also cut off a crucial resupply highway to Ukraine\u2019s \u201cfortress\u201d city of Kramatorsk, according to those watching the troop movements.",

      "\u201cThe Russians have had a tendency to intensify military operations in support of ongoing negotiations so the current events would fit into that picture quite well,\u201d Paroinen said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough information yet\u201d to be sure.",
      "The next 24-48 hours will likely be \u201ccrucial\u201d in whether Ukraine is able to stanch the Russian advance before Moscow reinforces these advanced units, he posted to X earlier. \u201cClearly the Ukrainians have a crisis on their hands,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A Ukrainian military spokesperson told NBC News that breakthroughs were being made only by small groups of Russian \u201cinfiltrators\u201d \u2014 who are being quickly found and \u201cdestroyed\u201d \u2014 rather than larger units capable of taking and controlling territory.",

      "\u201cOf course, the situation there is and remains difficult, and the fighting in this region is the most intense compared to other sections of the front line,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cHowever, the Ukrainian troops are making every effort to ensure that even those groups of Russians who managed to infiltrate through the first line are destroyed as soon as possible \u2014 which is what happens.\u201d",

      "The animals were also hidden in socks and packed in boxes labeled as almonds and chocolate cookies. Authorities estimated at the time that each turtle could have been sold for $2,000, bringing the total value of the smuggled reptiles to $4.2 million."

      "Seeking to defuse the tension, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva in early May. Following those talks, both countries lowered their tariffs by 115 percentage points for 90 days, to 30% on Chinese goods and 10% on U.S. goods.",

      "\u201cOur forces repelled a large-scale attack from several axes by the terrorist militia and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in lives and equipment, as more than 16 combat vehicles were destroyed and burned and 34 vehicles, including armored cars, were captured,\u201d the army claimed in a statement.",
      "There was no mention of the fight on the RSF\u2019s Telegram channel.",
      "Darfur Gov. Mini Arko Minawi said on Facebook that el-Fasher \u201ctriumphed over those who betrayed their land\u201d in an apparent reference to the RSF in Monday\u2019s fight.",
      "Meanwhile, in North Kordofan province the RSF has been accused of displacing over 3,000 families from 66 villages due to fighting since early August, according to the Sudan Doctors Network. The group also said the RSF looted the properties of those people and stole their money and livestock. Those displaced ended up arriving at Khartoum and White Nile provinces last week."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump said Monday that he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the grinding multiyear war between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "\u201cRussia has occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They\u2019ve occupied some very prime territory. We\u2019re going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine,\u201d Trump said at a news conference at the White House.",
      "Trump said he\u2019s going to see what Putin \u201chas in mind\u201d to end the war and, if it\u2019s a \u201cfair deal,\u201d he will share it with European and NATO leaders, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who have been liaising closely with Washington ahead of the meeting.",
      "Asked Monday if Zelenskyy was invited to the meeting Friday with Putin in Alaska, Trump said that the Ukrainian leader \u201cwasn\u2019t a part of it\u201d and that despite his having participated in numerous sitdowns over the course of the war, little has come of them. \u201cI would say he could go, but he\u2019s gone to a lot of meetings. You know, he\u2019s been there for three and a half years \u2014 nothing happened,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The president's first call out of the Putin meeting, which he referred to as \u201creally a feel-out,\u201d would be to Zelenskyy \u201cout of respect.\u201d  He noted that he might tell Zelenskyy \"\u2018lots of luck, keep fighting,\u2019 or I may say, \u2018We can make a deal.\u2019\"",
      "The comments came during a winding press conference to discuss efforts to fight crime in Washington, D.C., with a plan to federalize the city\u2019s police force.",
      "During his remarks, the president noted how even following \u201ca great call\u201d with Putin in the past, \u201cmissiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you\u2019d have 60 people laying on a road dying,\u201d a nod to the challenge of reaching a deal.",
      "A follow-up meeting could include Zelenskyy and Putin, and perhaps Trump himself, the president added. He said he would \u201cbe there if they need.\u201d",
      "But Trump said a Zelenskyy and Putin meeting was the only way to bring the conflict to a close.",
      "\u201cNow, I will say this, ultimately, I\u2019m going to put the two of them in a room, I\u2019ll be there or won\u2019t be there, and I think it\u2019ll get solved,\u201d the president added.",
      "He said he would like to see a ceasefire and reach the \u201cbest deal that could be made for both parties.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthere\u2019ll be some swapping, there\u2019ll be some changes in land,\u201d Trump said, returning to the idea of \u201cland swaps,\u201d which he said Friday would be \u201cto the betterment of both.\u201d Zelenskyy, though, has been unwavering in his position that Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia; European allies have agreed that giving up lands would encourage further Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cThe answer to Ukraine\u2019s territorial question is already in the constitution of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Saturday. \u201cNo one will and no one can deviate from it. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "Trump announced last week that he is meeting with Putin on Friday in Alaska as he tries to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially held out a meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy as a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition.",
      "The White House emphasized over the weekend that the priority is the upcoming one-on-one with Putin, even as it weighed the prospect of a future meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cNext Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,\u201d NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said over the weekend on ABC.",
      "Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow last week ahead of an Aug. 8 deadline that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions.",
      "Putin proposed the outlines of an agreement to end the war that would allow Russia to hold sweeping Ukrainian territory, but has not agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "Zelenskyy has urged stronger international pressure on Russia, warning against concessions to Moscow.",
      "\u201cAnother week has ended without any attempt by Russia to agree to the numerous demands of the world and stop the killings,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said on X.",
      "\u201cRussia is dragging out the war, and therefore it deserves stronger global pressure. Russia refuses to stop the killings, and therefore must not receive any rewards or benefits. And this is not just a moral position \u2014 it is a rational one. Concessions do not persuade a killer. But truly strong protection of life stops the killers,\u201d he added."

      "Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s reference to \u201cswapping\u201d territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side\u2019s control.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "Zelenskyy later spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron said on X that he had a long conversation with the Ukrainian president and with \u201cseveral European leaders,\u201d and reiterated his support for a ceasefire.",

      "The meeting with Vance included Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, as well as Lammy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg participated virtually, according to the official.",
      "The official called Saturday\u2019s meeting \u201cproductive\u201d and noted that there were discussions over potential security guarantees sought by Ukraine as part of any possible peace deal. Notably, the U.S. official denied that NATO membership was discussed as part of the counter initiative.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re productive, because it keeps the dialogue going,\u201d the senior official said, adding: \u201cEverybody was candid for comments, which, I thought, are important.\u201d",

      "The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin\u2019s first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first term, the president called Putin a strong and smart leader and said he \u201cgot along great\u201d with him.",

It\u2019s about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\u201d He also noted that Trump would most likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \u201canother step\u201d in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.",
      "Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.",

      "Australia said Monday that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing list of Western governments making the move as Israel becomes increasingly isolated over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government would recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next month.",
      "\u201cA two-state solution is humanity\u2019s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,\u201d he said at a news conference after a Cabinet meeting in Canberra.",
      "The Australian announcement follows similar ones in recent weeks by Britain, France and Canada. Though largely symbolic, they indicate a broader global shift against Israel\u2019s policies in Gaza, where the U.N. and others say people are dying of malnutrition and starvation after months of limited or nonexistent aid.",
      "Albanese said Australia\u2019s position was predicated on the commitments it had received from the Palestinian Authority, including that there would be no role for Hamas in any future Palestinian state.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began Oct. 7, 2023, with a terrorist attack on Israel in which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others. More than 61,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, have been killed in the ensuing Israeli military campaign, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Albanese said Australia stands with Israel in calling for the release of the 50 hostages remaining in Gaza, about 20 of whom Israel believes are still alive.",
      "\u201cFor the sake of their loved ones and all who share in their pain, we repeat that call today,\u201d he said.",
      "New Zealand also said Monday that it was considering recognition of a Palestinian state and would make a formal decision in September.",
      "\u201cNew Zealand has been clear for some time that our recognition of a Palestinian state is a matter of when, not if,\u201d Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a statement.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized such moves at a news conference Sunday before Australia\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cTo have European countries and Australia march into that rabbit hole, just like that, fall right into it, and buy this canard, is disappointing, and I think it\u2019s actually shameful,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu also defended his government\u2019s widely condemned proposal for a new military offensive in Gaza, which critics say is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in the enclave and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas.",
      "He said Israel had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfinish the job\u201d and \u201cdefeat Hamas,\u201d and that his goal was to rescue the remaining hostages.",
      "Netanyahu denied there was starvation in Gaza, a claim directly contradicted Sunday by a U.N. official briefing an emergency meeting of the Security Council.",
      "\u201cThis is no longer a looming hunger crisis \u2014 this is starvation, pure and simple,\u201d U.N. humanitarian coordination official Ramesh Rajasingham told the council.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children."
