    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is standing trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could.",
      "But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder.",
      "Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial",
      "Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

      "\u201cWe know at the Super Bowl these days that everyone watches, it\u2019s a wide audience,\u201d Jaiven said. The brand's ad shows stars from the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise enjoying an ice cream bar. \u201cWe thought it was time for us to tell our story, remind people what they love about Haagen-Dazs and of course, have them stock up on Haagen-Dazs in their freezer.\"",

      "Hellmann's",
      "Hellmann's ad made a splash ahead of the game by reuniting Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal's \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d characters at Katz's Deli enjoying a sandwich with Hellmann's. Sydney Sweeney joins to utter the famous line \u201cI'll have what she's having.\u201d",

Duracell has teased that its ad will feature a \u201cDuracell Scientist\u201d but hasn't given any other details.",

      "An Arkansas organist is marking the 275th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death by playing all of the German composer's organ works, but he's doing it one lunch break at a time",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- It was hushed inside a 140-year-old cathedral on the outskirts of Little Rock's downtown as about five dozen people sat in the pews during a recent lunch break in January.",
      "The nave filled with the sounds of the Gothic church's pipe organ, and a screen showed a man performing the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Those gathered weren't there for church, but for the third concert in a series Colin MacKnight is performing over the next year to commemorate the 275th anniversary of Bach's death.",
      "MacKnight, Trinity Episcopal Cathedral's music director, is performing all of Bach's organ works throughout 2025 \u2014 one lunch break at a time. The ambitious plan entails performing 18 hours of music in half-hour increments nearly every Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI've wanted to for a really long time because it's, I think, the most thorough way of immersing myself in the brilliance of Johann Sebastian Bach,\u201d MacKnight said one morning as he rehearsed in the empty cathedral the day before a concert.",
      "The concerts in Little Rock are among several events around the world this year commemorating the German composer\u2019s legacy and the anniversary of his death.",
      "MacKnight, who is from Bethesda, Maryland, has been music director at Trinity for three years. He said the first time he remembers hearing Bach was at a relative's funeral when he was about 12 years old.",
      "\u201cSomething about hearing it that time just really mesmerized me and that was the beginning of my love of Bach,\u201d he said.",
      "The 31-year-old's hands move easily between the four keyboards of the organ console, flanked by knobs controlling different sounds that are assembled into various combinations.",
      "Underneath, his feet press on the pedalboards \u2014 combining to create the notes of Bach's works. MacKnight, who has played the organ since he was 16, acknowledges how dizzying the sight of the instrument can be for newcomers.",
      "\u201cIf you don't know what you're looking at, it's a little overwhelming, like an airplane console,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight's concerts \u2014 which are free and open to the public \u2014 are also mini-lessons for those who come, with a glossary of terms like concerto and fugue included in the program. In between pieces, MacKnight gives audience members some background on Bach and his organ works.",
      "\u201cThese pieces are in the unfortunate category of being much, much harder than they sound,\u201d he says.",
      "Generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Bach is known in particular for his organ works and their heavy use of pedals and complex structures. Few organists perform the composer's complete organ works, given the difficulty and quantity of the music.",
      "They include Grammy-winning organist Paul Jacobs, who taught MacKnight at the Juilliard School. Jacobs performed an 18-hour nonstop concert of Bach's organ works to mark the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.",
      "The free concerts so far have drawn a mix of church members, classical music aficionados and newcomers who say they want a quiet break from the daily bustle.",
      "\u201cI like the complexity of the music and the power of the organ, which stirs me internally,\u201d said Barry Coplin, a member of the church who has attended two of MacKnight\u2019s concerts.",
      "Ben Wiley, who lives about 30 minutes away, is a classical music fan who was attending his third of MacKnight\u2019s shows and said he appreciates being able to hear Bach\u2019s works in half-hour increments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to be able to get it done in short bursts, to be able to absorb it better and come back to get the next batch,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight is also performing a 100-minute concert of Bach's most extensive organ work \u2014 the Clavier-Ubung III, sometimes referred to as the German Organ Mass \u2014 on July 28, the day the German composer died in 1750 at 65.",
      "The Rev. Thomas Alexander, a priest at Trinity, said the concerts allow the public to enjoy MacKnight's talents, come together and learn more about Bach in a way they normally wouldn't be able to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like reading someone's complete collection of novels. You get to really get to know someone in a comprehensive way,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut it also builds a sense of community.\u201d"

      "Victoria Schade is a dog trainer and novelist who's the show\u2019s lead puppy trainer and wrangler. She's the one making sure the shelter pups have a conflict-free contest and that they're captured at their most adorable \u2014 all from off-camera.",
      "It is Schade who gets the puppies to look up during the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d or run through a tunnel to get to the field for the starting lineups. She\u2019s on the lookout for possible conflicts or nervous dogs.",
      "\u201cMy responsibilities include ensuring puppy happiness and safety during gameplay,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if there\u2019s any moment where a puppy looks like they\u2019re overwhelmed or they just need a break, I\u2019ll step out and give them a little break on the sideline.\u201d",
      "Schade has been working with the doggies on the Animal Planet show for 19 years and is believed to be the longest serving member of the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d crew. She also works the kitten halftime show and calls filming both her favorite week of the year.",
      "\u201cI think she is one of the most dedicated, hardest working people out there in the business,\u201d says \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d referee Dan Schachner, now in his 14th year. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ever seem to run out of energy. She never says no to a request and there\u2019s always brightness and sunshine from her with every step.\u201d",
      "Schade has coached hundreds of dogs over the years but never adopted one from the show \u2014 until now. She took home Boris \u2014 known on the show as Mr. Pickles \u2014 from Dallas Dog rescue. \u201cI saw star quality. So this was the year,\u201d she says.",
      "Early on, Schade was responsible for recruiting and selecting the puppies, a task now that leans on animal rescue groups and shelters throughout the country. These days, she's the lead trainer.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing the puppy looking up at the camera, I\u2019m typically right there with the treat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of treats and funny noises. And that does the trick.\u201d",
      "This year, Schade is stepping out from the sidelines and joining Schachner on camera for an hour-long pre-game kickoff show, which features a doggie combine and a draft. Other show highlights include segments with Dan Smyers, from superstar country duo Dan + Shay, and Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi.",
      "Schade has developed some very special animal-related skills over the years, including anticipating when one of the players needs to relieve itself.",
      "\u201cOne of my \u2018Puppy Bowl\u2019 skills is reading butts. So I know when a puppy is going to go to the bathroom and I\u2019ll typically say like, \u2018Watch out in the 20-yard-line, we\u2019re going to have a deposit\u2019 and everyone\u2019s ready to go with that cleanup.\u201d",
      "The \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d made its debut as counter-programming to the Super Bowl in 2005. Dogs score touchdowns on a gridiron carpet when they cross the goal line \u2014 any goal line \u2014 with a toy in their mouth.",
      "The show is really just an excuse to spend time watching adorable, clumsy pups play with chew toys, wag their tails furiously and lick the camera. A deeper reason is to encourage animal adoption.",
      "According to the ASPCA, approximately 390,000 shelter dogs are euthanized each year and 2 million shelter dogs are adopted.",
      "Most of the puppies are usually adopted by airtime, since the show was filmed in the fall. But the point is to show that animals just like the ones on the show can be found at any shelter at any time.",
      "This year's three-hour television event this year will feature 142 rescue puppies from 80 shelters across 40 states \u2014 and one from Nicaragua, a Chihuahua-German shepherd. There will be 11 special needs dogs.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most amount we\u2019ve ever had,\" says Schachner. \"Look out for Jolene, who is a pitbull mix that\u2019s in a wheelchair. Look out for a three-legged Boston terrier from New York City. And my personal favorite, is Sprinkle, who is a blind and deaf Aussie. So it\u2019s just incredible to watch them play.\u201d",
      "The inaugural \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d was watched by nearly 6 million viewers. Last year, 12.6 million viewers tuned in. In comparison, this year\u2019s Golden Globes attracted 9.3 million.",
      "Schade, whose first book was \u201c Bonding With Your Dog \u201d and who then pivoted to writing pet-oriented novels, like \u201cLife on the Leash\u201d and \u201cDog Friendly,\u201d is a wealth of information about our four-legged friends.",
      "She advises dog owners to learn to read the body language of their pet, to try to understand what they're trying to say. Like tail-wagging \u2014 how tight? And where is the tail positioned?",
      "Schade is a big advocate for positive reinforcement and science-based training, not the so-called alpha dog approach, which uses intimidation or force.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be the alpha, which has been debunked anyway. You are your dog's ally. You\u2019re their friend. You\u2019re their No. 1. And it\u2019s a relationship based in compassion and understanding.\u201d",
      "That means load up on treats. She advocates keeping them in your pocket and consistently using them as rewards for good behavior, especially when potty training.",
      "\u201cI cannot stress it enough: When you think you\u2019re treating enough, treat more because, especially during puppyhood, it is such a critical learning period and every interaction is a chance to teach something.\u201d",

      "We have by now become accustomed to the lengths some movie characters will go to keep a good comedy lie going. But it\u2019s still a special kind of feat when Amy Schumer, playing a baby-mad single woman who fakes a baby bump in \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d is so desperate to maintain the fiction that she shoves a roast turkey up her dress.",
      "You might be thinking: This is too ridiculous. The stuffing, alone. But if we bought \u201cSome Like it Hot\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d I see no reason to quibble with the set-up of \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a funny and often perceptive satire on motherhood, both real and pretend.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which debuted Wednesday on Netflix, is a kinda throwback comedy. Like \u201c40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d and \u201cWedding Crashers,\u201d you can basically get the movie just from its title.",
      "But like any good high-concept comedy, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is predominantly a far-fetched way for its star and co-writer, Schumer, to riff frankly on her chosen topic. Here, that\u2019s the wide gamut of pregnancy experience \u2014 the body changes, the gender reveal parties, the personal jealousies \u2014 all while mixing in a healthy amount of pseudo-pregnant pratfalls.",
      "It\u2019s been a decade since Schumer was essentially launched as a movie star in the 2015 Judd Apatow-directed \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d But \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which Schumer wrote with Julie Paiva, almost as adeptly channels Schumer\u2019s comic voice \u2014 the one that made the sketch series \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d so great.",
      "The movie\u2019s opening flashes back to Lainey (Schumer) as a child playing with dolls and imagining herself a mother-to-be. So committed is she to the role that Lainey, in mock-labor, screams at her friend and then politely apologies: \u201cSorry, but the expectant mother often lashes out at her support system.\u201d",
      "But as middle age approaches, Lainey, a high school teacher in Brooklyn, isn\u2019t close to her dream. At the dinner where she suspects \u2014 no, is so certain that she tears open the desert looking for a ring \u2014 that her longtime boyfriend (Damon Wayans Jr.) is going to pop the question, he instead asks her to join a threesome. Back at school, Lainey\u2019s school lesson on \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d turns darkly cynical.",
      "Things are even worse when Lainey\u2019s married best friend (Jillian Bell) divulges that she\u2019s pregnant. \u201cGet rid of it!\u201d blurts Lainey before apologizing. When the pair later go clothes shopping, Lainey absentmindedly tries on belly padding. The saleswoman is instantly nice to her, offering a burrito and a foot rub. \u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d she asks. \u201cDoor dash,\u201d responds Lainey before adding, \u201cdriver.\u201d",
      "Much of the fun in \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is watching Lainey come up with increasingly ridiculous lies as she tries to pull off the pregnant act. (After accidentally picking Thanksgiving as her time of inception, Lainey digs a deeper hole by suggesting it happened at \u201ca Black Friday Eve sale.\u201d)",
      "But the ruse becomes more difficult when she, during a pregnant workout class, meets a woman (Brianne Howey, refreshingly authentic) she genuinely likes and wants to be friends with. Even more complicated: Lainey starts falling for another guy she first meets at a coffee shop ( Will Forte ).",
      "In a movie filled with funny people (others include Urzila Carlson as a guidance counselor, and Alex Moffat as a idiotic father-to-be) Forte is an especially good presence in \u201cKinda Pregnant.\u201d For a performer of such madcap absurdity, Forte fits in remarkably naturally in a more rom-com setting. He\u2019s also got a wonderfully ridiculous occupation, even by rom-com standards, driving a Zamboni in Central Park.",
      "You can probably guess how \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d goes from here. Director Tyler Spindel, nephew to Adam Sandler (a producer on the film), doesn't do anything to advance the movie comedy, a languishing proposition in recent years with few big-screen exceptions. But he crucially gives his performers plenty of space to be themselves, and Lainey's desperate desire to have a family comes across as both over-the-top and genuine. If \u201cKnocked Up\u201d captured the comedy of getting unexpectedly pregnant, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d embodies the pain of wishing you were.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content, language throughout and drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "LOS ANGELES -- A former friend who alleges rapper A$AP Rocky fired a gun at him in 2021 testified Monday that no one involved in the incident gave him any indication the firearm might have been fake \u2014 as the defense contends \u2014 until the day this trial started.",
      "The testimony from the trial\u2019s key witness, who goes by A$AP Relli, came at the end of a long, frustrating slog on the stand in a Los Angeles courtroom that drove him to shout, \u201cYou're annoying, bro!\u201d and much more at the lead defense attorney.",
      "In its re-direct questioning on Monday, the prosecution pushed back against the idea that for security Rocky carried a starter pistol that only shot blanks.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec showed Relli texts from after the incident in which he told Rocky \u201cU try killing me\u201d and that Rocky had tried to take him from his daughter.",
      "\u201cAt any point did he respond to your text messages to tell you it was a fake gun?\u201d The prosecutor asked Relli, who testified his knuckles were grazed in the incident.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d he responded. He said the same of the two mutual friends who had been there.",
      "The testimony was the first time the jury heard how late the prop gun defense was revealed, despite more than three years passing and several days of testimony at a preliminary hearing in 2023.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of his two toddler sons, was not in the courtroom after being in the audience to support him for the trial\u2019s previous three days.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with a conviction carry a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison.",
      "A day earlier, the hip-hop star was up a Grammy Award for the third time at a ceremony just two miles away, but lost to one of the night\u2019s big winners, Kendrick Lamar.",
      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",

      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",
      "\u201cOnce I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" says the recording that Sajimi testified he made in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the DA to find me. Because I\u2019m going to be on another island.\u201d",
      "Sajimi testified that he builds websites for artists and brands, and has worked with both Rocky and Relli, but said he is much closer to Rocky, who he considers a friend."

      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

    "story": [
      "Women folk singers are preserving one of Morocco's most cherished culturual traditions, a genre of folk singing known as aita",
      "SIDI YAHYA ZAER, Morocco -- Mbarka Moullablad\u2019s family frowned when she first told them she planned to make a living as a cheikha, singing about love, pain, and societal change to the melodies of her ancestors under the stage name \u201cThouria.\u201d",
      "Women like her are the stewards of one of Morocco\u2019s most cherished oral traditions: a form of folk singing known as aita, which means a \u201ccry\u201d or \u201clament\u201d in Arabic. From smoky bars and cabarets in Morocco\u2019s largest cities to the gatherings in the country\u2019s rural regions, they croon at weddings, festivals and private events and pub nights, hypnotizing audiences both humble and wealthy.",
      "But despite aita's position in Moroccan culture, the genre\u2019s popularity does not always translate into acceptance for those who perform it. Cheikha are often stigmatized, eroticized, and pushed to society\u2019s margins. That was once a fear for Moullablad, but she says her community in Sidi Yahya Zaer, a farming town on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic plains, has mostly accepted her.",
      "\u201cMy family did not agree at first and I used to suffer from society\u2019s judgment, but now everything is good,\u201d Moullablad said on the sidelines of a recent performance south of Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat. \u201cI do it in order to earn money for my children.\u201d",
      "A form of sung poetry, aita has long explored themes of societal triumphs, ironies, and unspoken struggles, including those related to relationships and economic hardship. Cheikha don heavy stage makeup, silk caftans, and golden takchita belts as they sing about their community's agonies and triumphs. They sway their hips to amplify emotion, dancing seductively or cheerfully depending on the context.",
      "When Moullablad performs, men and women lean in as her voice softens, captivated as she climbs octaves into a full-throated howl. The beads wrapped around her sister Fatiha\u2019s belly shake as she dances. The band leader, another singer, backs her with his own poetry while a drummer keeps the beat, a guitarist strums, and a violinist drags his bow in sync.",
      "Those who come to hear them sing say cheikha can serve as a community's truth-tellers, singing about often unspoken dynamics related to marriage, agriculture or, historically, colonial resistance. Moullablad sings in Moroccan Arabic, embodying traditions specific to her community. But cheikha across the North African Kingdom also perform in the indigenous Amazigh language, adapting the music and lyrics to reflect their region.",
      "The art form has inspired contemporary acts like the electro-infused \u201cAita, Mon Amour\u201d and Kabareh Cheikhats, a troupe of male actors who pay homage, dress and sing in the tune of Morocco's most celebrated 20th century women folk singers. It is also the subject of Morocco\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s Academy Awards, \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d which follows a single mother who leaves her town in the Atlas Mountains to pursue her dream of singing in bars, cabarets, and hotels in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cI was always amazed by their strength and the power that they have toward people when they open their mouths. Whether they are modern or conservative people, they all stand up and get into a kind of trance like gospel,\u201d Nabil Ayouch, the film\u2019s director, said in an interview when the film premiered at the Marrakech Film Festival last year.",
      "Morocco\u2019s music scene is increasingly embracing Middle Eastern pop and rap by North African artists from throughout the diaspora. And rural communities are shrinking amid the country's rapid development and urbanization. But though the future of aita may seem uncertain, its musicians and listeners remain confident that it will endure.",
      "\u201cAita will not die because it is renewed by young people. Aita will remain in all times and is loved by old people and young people as well. It is developed and improved, but they preserve its origins,\u201d said Rachid Kadari, a Cheikh who also sings aita."

The Grammys almost veered into a telethon; $7 million was pledged from viewers of the show.",
      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",

      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members.

      "Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York on Monday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",

      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",
      "Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman\u2019s \u201cThe Graveyard Book,\u201d while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on \u201cThe Sandman.\u201d"

      "PARIS -- A Paris court found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country\u2019s first big #MeToo trial.",
      "Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie \u201cLes Diables,\u201d or \u201cThe Devils,\u201d in the early 2000s.",
      "Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women\u2019s rights activists as she left the courtroom.",
      "The court ruled that Ruggia \u201ctook advantage of the dominant position\u201d he had on Haenel at the time. \u201cDuring quasi-weekly meetings at your home for over three years you had sexualized gestures and attitudes,\u201d as Haenel was \u201cgradually isolated\u201d from her loved ones, the court said in a statement.",
      "Ruggia's lawyer said her client would appeal.",
      "He \u201cmaintains that he has never touched Ad\u00e8le Haenel,\u201d the lawyer, Fanny Colin, said. \u201cSentenced in these conditions and on the sole basis of her words seems to us not only unjustified but dangerous.\u201d",
      "Haenel, star of the 2019 Cannes entry \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d has in recent years vocally protested what she\u2019s called an insufficient response to sexual abuse in French filmmaking.",
      "At the C\u00e9sar Awards in 2020, she walked out of the ceremony after Roman Polanski won best director. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.",
      "In 2023, Haenel, announced she was quitting the French film industry that she denounced for \u201ccomplacency toward sexual aggressors.\u201d She published an open letter in which she said Cannes and other pillars of the French film industry are \u201cready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs.\u201d",
      "While #MeToo initially struggled to find traction in France, some other actors and film industry workers have since spoken out.",
      "French renowned actor Judith Godr\u00e8che attended Monday\u2019s verdict at the Paris courthouse. \u201cIt was a very moving and a very important moment that reminded me of things that, in my case, may go unpunished,\u201d she told reporters with tears in her eyes.",
      "Last year, Godr\u00e8che accused film director Beno\u00eet Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024.",
      "Godr\u00e8che is also accusing another film director, Jacques Doillon, of sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15.",
      "Both Jacquot and Doillon have denied the allegations.",
      "In a separate case, French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu is to go on trial in March on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using \u201cviolence, coercion, surprise or threat\u201d in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of \u201cLes Volets verts,\u201d or \"The Green Shutters.\u201d"

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has ordered state employees back to their offices full-time starting next month.",
      "In an executive order issued Tuesday, DeWine required all permanent employees of state agencies, boards and commissions to resume five-day, in-office work weeks no later than March 17. He said the move will allow the state to best serve the public and to make best use of its remaining office space. Both are in the best interests of Ohio citizens, he wrote.",
      "The return date set by DeWine falls almost five years to the day after the state declared an emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 9, 2020, and allowed certain employees to work remotely.",
      "Many of those workers either returned to their offices full-time or on a hybrid basis starting in June 2021, when the emergency was lifted.",
      "Tuesday's order requires virtually all employees to now return. It allows agencies to grant exceptions in cases where some or all of their real estate portfolios have been eliminated. Lease terminations and space reallocations that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic saved Ohio taxpayers millions of dollars, the order says.",
      "According to the document, a majority of Ohio's state employees actually never worked remotely, due to the nature of their work at state hospitals, prisons, law enforcement agencies or in other jobs requiring a physical presence.",
      "DeWine's mandate comes as some major Columbus employers, including American Electric Power and JPMorganChase, also have required a return to five-day work weeks in March. Republican President Donald Trump also is requiring federal workers to return full-time to offices, an order that's as part of an unprecedented series of steps aimed at shrinking the federal government."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's effort to ban federal funding for gender-affirming care for young people is facing a legal challenge",
      "Seven families with transgender or nonbinary children filed a lawsuit Tuesday over President Donald Trump's executive orders to narrowly define the sexes and halt federal support for gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19.",
      "PFLAG, a national group for family of LGBTQ+ people; and GLMA, a doctors organization, are also plaintiffs in the court challenge in a Baltimore federal court.",
      "It comes one week after Trump signed an order calling for the federal government to stop funding the medical care through federal government-run health insurance programs including Medicaid and TRICARE.",
      "Kristen Chapman, the mother of one of the plaintiffs in the case, said her family moved to Richmond, Virginia, from Tennessee in 2023 because of a ban on gender-affirming care in their home state. Her 17-year-old daughter, Willow, had an initial appointment scheduled for last week with a new provider who would accept Medicaid. But Trump signed his order the day before and the hospital said it could not provide care.",
      "\u201cI thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter,\u201d Kristen Chapman said in a statement. \"Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "She's not the only one, Brian Bond, the CEO of PFLAG, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe are receiving a drumbeat of calls from parents whose kids' care is being canceled.\u201d",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing the plaintiffs, want a judge to put the order on hold. In a court filing Tuesday, they said Trump's executive orders are \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d because they seek to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because they violate antidiscrimination laws. The challenge also says that the order infringes on the rights of parents.",
      "Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, they also argue that the policy discriminates because it does not prohibit federal funds for the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Some health providers immediately paused providing the coverage while they assess how the order affects them. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly battled Trump in court, told hospitals in her state Monday that it would violate the law to stop offering gender-affirming care to people under 19.",
      "Josh Block, an ACLU lawyer on the case, said that medical providers should continue gender-affirming care for people under 19. \u201cIt should not take either a protest, a letter from the attorney general or a TRO,\u201d or temporary restraining order from the court for them to do so.",
      "Trump's approach on transgender policy represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people.",
      "Trump has used strong language, asserting in the order on gender-affirming care that \"medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, the doctors group in the legal challenge, said there are established medical standards for caring for transgender youth. \u201cNow, an extreme political agenda is trying to overrule that expertise, putting young people and their providers in danger,\" Sheldon said in a statement. \"We are confident that the law, science, and history are on our side.\u201d",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Legal challenges have already been filed on the military order and a plan to move transgender women in federal prisons to men's facilities. Others are expected to be filed, just as there have been challenges to a variety of Trump's policies.",
      "Researchers have found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents receive the care, which includes treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries \u2014 though surgery is rare for children.",
      "As transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in some ways, there's been vehement pushback. At least 26 states have passed laws to restrict or ban the care for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year but has not yet ruled on whether Tennessee's ban on the care is constitutional.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has asked state legislators to double their spending to date on Hurricane Helene recovery and approve it now",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.",
      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan authorities on Monday began a clinical trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week.",
      "Health workers and others exposed to the Ebola strain are being targeted in the study, which began four days after Uganda announced the death of a nurse in the capital, Kampala. Two more cases were confirmed on Monday in relatives of the first victim.",
      "Officials are investigating the source of the outbreak. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said he also sought the services of a traditional healer.",
      "At least 234 contacts in this outbreak have been identified, according to the Ministry of Health.",
      "Health authorities have access to more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain. IAVI provided the vaccine.",
      "The trial \u201cmarks a major milestone in public health emergency response and demonstrates the power of collaboration for global health security,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO director for Africa, said in a statement.",
      "This is the first Ebola outbreak since the Trump administration's decision last week to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, and since Trump's order for a freeze on foreign assistance.",
      "Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever.",
      "A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there.",
      "The confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease last month, and Rwanda in December announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat.",
      "Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named."

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",

Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a new study."

      "Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma after Rwanda-backed rebels captured the major city in eastern Congo last week",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",
      "The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition.",

      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday for treatment",
      "RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt -- A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing on Saturday, the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago.",
      "The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed last month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egypt's Al-Qahera television showed at least two Palestinian Red Cross ambulances pulling up to the crossing gate. Several children were brought out on gurneys and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. From there, they were rushed to hospitals in the nearby Egyptian city of el-Arish and elsewhere. Footage showed one young girl whose foot had been amputated.",
      "Zaher al-Wahidi, an official with Gaza's Health Ministry, said 37 of the children had crossed into Egypt by Saturday evening.",
      "The Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "The children are the first in what are meant to be regular evacuations of Palestinians through the crossing for treatment abroad.",
      "Over the past 15 months, Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

A German envoy, Bjorn Kummel, warned: \u201cThe roof is on fire, and we need to stop the fire as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",
      "A budget document presented at the meeting showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash. \u201cReadiness functions\u201d in WHO\u2019s Europe office were more than 80% reliant on the $154 million the U.S. contributes.",
      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",
      "The U.S. also covers 95% of WHO's tuberculosis work in Europe and more than 60% of TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific and at the agency headquarters in Geneva, the document said.",
      "At a separate private meeting on the impact of the U.S. exit last Wednesday, WHO finance director George Kyriacou said if the agency spends at its current rate, the organization would \u201cbe very much in a hand-to-mouth type situation when it comes to our cash flows\u201d in the first half of 2026. He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s executive order, WHO has attempted to withdraw funds from the U.S. for past expenses, Kyriacou said, but most of those \u201chave not been accepted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has yet to settle its owed contributions to WHO for 2024, pushing the agency into a deficit, he added.",
      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the attendees at the budget meeting that the agency is still providing U.S. scientists with some data \u2014 though it isn't known what data.",
      "\u201cWe continue to give them information because they need it,\u201d Tedros said, urging member countries to contact U.S officials. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you continue to push and reach out to them to reconsider.\u201d",
      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office. In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",
      "Tedros also said he believed the U.S. departure was \u201cnot about the money\u201d but more about the \u201cvoid\u201d in outbreak details and other critical health information that the United States would face in the future.",
      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",
      "Kummel, a senior advisor on global health in Germany's health ministry, described the U.S. exit as \u201cthe most extensive crisis WHO has been facing in the past decades.\u201d",
      "He also asked: \u201cWhat concrete functions of WHO will collapse if the funding of the U.S. is not existent anymore?\u201d",
      "Officials from countries including Bangladesh and France asked what specific plans WHO had to deal with the loss of U.S. funding and wondered which health programs would be cut as a result.",
      "The AP obtained a document shared among some WHO senior managers that laid out several options, including a proposal that each major department or office might be slashed in half by the end of the year.",
      "WHO declined to comment on whether Tedros had privately asked countries to lobby on the agency's behalf.",
      "Some experts said that while the departure of the U.S. was a major crisis, it might also serve as an opportunity to reshape global public health.",
      "Less than 1% of the U.S. health budget goes to WHO, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics. In exchange, the U.S. gets \u201ca wide variety of benefits to Americans that matter quite a bit,\u201d he said. That includes intelligence about disease epidemics globally and virus samples for vaccines.",
      "Kavanagh also said the WHO is \"massively underfunded,\u201d describing the contributions from rich countries as \u201cpeanuts.\u201d",
      "WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said at the meeting on the impact of the U.S. withdrawal last week that losing the U.S. was \u201cterrible,\u201d but member states had \u201ctremendous capacity to fill in those gaps.\u201d",
      "Ryan told WHO member countries: \u201cThe U.S. is leaving a community of nations. It\u2019s essentially breaking up with you.\u201d",
      "Kavanagh doubted the U.S. would be able to match WHO's ability to gather details about emerging health threats globally, and said its exit from the agency \u201cwill absolutely lead to worse health outcomes for Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow much worse remains to be seen,\u201d Kavanagh said.",

      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "A New York doctor has been indicted by a Lousiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

      "",
      "Despite long COVID's vast reach, the federal government's investment in researching the disease  --  to the tune of $1.15 billion as of December  --  has so far failed to bring any new treatments to market.",
      "",
      "This disappoints and angers the patient community, who say the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should focus on ways to stop their suffering instead of simply trying to understand why they're suffering.",
      "",
      "\"It's unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began, we still don't have one FDA-approved drug,\" said Meighan Stone, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, a patient-led advocacy organization. Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",
      "",
      "\"What [RECOVER] lacks, really, is clarity of vision and clarity of purpose,\" said Al-Aly, saying he agrees that the NIH has had enough time and money to produce more meaningful progress.",
      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",
      "",
      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients. This has stirred cautious optimism among those who say that the agency's approach to long COVID has lacked urgency in the search for effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",
      "",
      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",
      "",
      "In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion for the NIH to launch RECOVER, raising hopes in the long COVID patient community.",
      "",
      "Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER's goal was to better understand long COVID as a disease and that clinical trials of potential treatments would come later.",
      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's website says this research has led to crucial insights on the risk factors for developing long COVID and on understanding how the disease interacts with preexisting conditions.",
      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",
      "",
      "\"I also will remind you that we're only 3, 4 years into this pandemic for most people,\" Horwitz said. \"We've been spending much more money than this, yearly, for 30, 40 years on other conditions.\"",
      "",
      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",
      "",
      "This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists to understand what is happening biologically to people who don't recover after an initial infection  --  and that will help determine which clinical trials for treatments are worth undertaking.",
      "",
      "\"Simply trying treatments because they are available without any evidence about whether or why they may be effective reduces the likelihood of successful trials and may put patients at risk of harm,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Delayed Hopes or Incremental Progress?",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",
      "",
      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids. But Davids said the NIH shouldn't have named the initiative \"RECOVER,\" since it wasn't designed as a streamlined effort to develop treatments.",
      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's initial allocation of $1.15 billion probably wasn't enough to develop a new medication to treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Healthcare Transformation Institute.",
      "",
      "But, he said, the results of preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies to fund more studies on drug development and test how existing drugs influence a patient's immune response.",
      "",
      "Emanuel is one of the authors of a March 2022 COVID roadmap report. He notes that RECOVER's lack of focus on new treatments was a problem. \"Only 15% of the budget is for clinical studies. That is a failure in itself  --  a failure of having the right priorities,\" he told KFF Health News and NPR via email.",
      "",
      "And though the NYU biobank has been impactful, Emanuel said there needs to be more focus on how existing drugs influence immune response.",
      "",
      "He said some clinical trials that RECOVER has funded are \"ridiculous,\" because they've focused on symptom amelioration, for example to study the benefits of over-the-counter medication to improve sleep. Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",
      "",
      "\"I'm just disgusted,\" said long COVID patient Hayes. \"You wouldn't tell somebody with diabetes to breathe through it.\"",
      "",
      "Chim\u00e9re L. Sweeney, director and founder of the Black Long COVID Experience, said she's even taken breaks from seeking treatment after getting fed up with being told that her symptoms were due to her diet or mental health.",
      "",
      "\"You're at the whim of somebody who may not even understand the spectrum of long COVID,\" Sweeney said.",
      "",
      "Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments",
      "",
      "Since there are still no long COVID treatments approved by the FDA, anything a physician prescribes is classified as either experimental  --  for unproven treatments  --  or an off-label use of a drug approved for other conditions. This means patients can struggle to get insurance to cover prescriptions.",
      "",
      "Michael Brode, MD, medical director for UT Health Austin's Post-COVID-19 Program  --  said he writes many appeal letters. And some people pay for their own treatment.",
      "",
      "For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, low-dose naltrexone, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are all promising treatments, he said.",
      "",
      "For hyperbaric oxygen, two small, randomized controlled studies show improvements for the chronic fatigue and brain fog that often plague long COVID patients. The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",
      "",
      "However, the out-of-pocket cost for a series of sessions in a hyperbaric chamber can run as much as $8,000, Brode said.",
      "",
      "\"Am I going to look a patient in the eye and say, 'You need to spend that money for an unproven treatment'?\" he said. \"I don't want to hype up a treatment that is still experimental. But I also don't want to hide it.\"",
      "",
      "There's a host of pharmaceuticals that have promising off-label uses for long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president and chief scientific officer at the Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, she's collaborating on a clinical study that repurposes two HIV drugs to treat long COVID.",
      "",
      "Proal said research on treatments can move forward based on what's already understood about the disease. For instance, she said that scientists have evidence  --  partly due to RECOVER research  --  that some patients continue to harbor small amounts of viral material after a COVID infection. She has not received RECOVER funds but is researching antivirals.",
      "",
      "But to vet a range of possible treatments for the millions suffering now  --  and to develop new drugs specifically targeting long COVID  --  clinical trials are needed. And that requires money.",
      "",
      "Hayes said she would definitely volunteer for an investigational drug trial. For now, though, \"in order to not be absolutely miserable,\" she said she focuses on what she can do, like having dinner with her family. At the same time, Hayes doesn't want to spend the rest of her life on a beige couch.",

      "Palestinians will mark this year the 77th anniversary of their mass expulsion from what is now Israel",
      "JERUSALEM -- Palestinians will mark this year the 77th anniversary of their mass expulsion from what is now Israel, an event that is at the core of their national struggle.",
      "But in many ways, that experience pales in comparison to the calamity now faced in the Gaza Strip \u2014 particularly as President Donald Trump has suggested that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and that the United States take \u201cownership\u201d of the enclave.",
      "Palestinians refer to their 1948 expulsion as the Nakba, Arabic for catastrophe. Some 700,000 Palestinians \u2014 a majority of the prewar population \u2014 fled or were driven from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel's establishment.",
      "After the war, Israel refused to allow them to return because it would have resulted in a Palestinian majority within its borders. Instead, they became a seemingly permanent refugee community that now numbers some 6 million, with most living in slum-like urban refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "In Gaza, the refugees and their descendants make up around three-quarters of the population.",
      "Israel's rejection of what Palestinians say is their right of return to their 1948 homes has been a core grievance in the conflict and was one of the thorniest issues in peace talks that last collapsed 15 years ago. The refugee camps have always been the main bastions of Palestinian militancy.",
      "Now, many Palestinians fear a repeat of their painful history on an even more cataclysmic scale.",
      "All across Gaza, Palestinians in recent days have been loading up cars and donkey carts or setting out on foot to visit their destroyed homes after a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war took hold Jan. 19. The images from several rounds of mass evacuations throughout the war \u2014 and their march back north on foot \u2014 are strikingly similar to black-and-white photographs from 1948.",
      "Mustafa al-Gazzar, in his 80s, recalled in 2024 his family's monthslong flight from their village in what is now central Israel to the southern city of Rafah, when he was 5. At one point they were bombed from the air, at another, they dug holes under a tree to sleep in for warmth.",
      "Al-Gazzar, now a great-grandfather, was forced to flee again in the war, this time to a tent in Muwasi, a barren coastal area where some 450,000 Palestinians live in a squalid camp. He said then the conditions are worse than in 1948, when the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees was able to regularly provide food and other essentials.",
      "\u201cMy hope in 1948 was to return, but my hope today is to survive,\u201d he said.",
      "The war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, making it by far the deadliest round of fighting in the history of the conflict. The initial Hamas attack killed some 1,200 Israelis.",
      "The war has forced some 1.7 million Palestinians \u2014 around three quarters of the territory's population \u2014 to flee their homes, often multiple times. That is well over twice the number that fled before and during the 1948 war.",
      "Israel has sealed its border. Egypt has only allowed a small number of Palestinians to leave, in part because it fears a mass influx of Palestinians could generate another long-term refugee crisis.",
      "The international community is strongly opposed to any mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza \u2014 an idea embraced by far-right members of the Israeli government, who refer to it as \u201cvoluntary emigration.\u201d",
      "Israel has long called for the refugees of 1948 to be absorbed into host countries, saying that calls for their return are unrealistic and would endanger its existence as a Jewish-majority state. It points to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who came to Israel from Arab countries during the turmoil following its establishment, though few of them want to return.",
      "Even if Palestinians are not expelled from Gaza en masse, many fear that they will never be able to return to their homes or that the destruction wreaked on the territory will make it impossible to live there. One U.N. estimate said it would take until 2040 to rebuild destroyed homes.",
      "The Jewish militias in the 1948 war with the armies of neighboring Arab nations were mainly armed with lighter weapons like rifles, machine guns and mortars. Hundreds of depopulated Palestinian villages were demolished after the war, while Israelis moved into Palestinian homes in Jerusalem, Jaffa and other cities.",
      "In Gaza, Israel has unleashed one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history, at times dropping 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs on dense, residential areas. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to wastelands of rubble and plowed-up roads, many littered with unexploded bombs.",
      "Yara Asi, a Palestinian assistant professor at the University of Central Florida who has done research on the damage to civilian infrastructure in the war, says it's \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to imagine the kind of international effort that would be necessary to rebuild Gaza.",
      "Even before the war, many Palestinians spoke of an ongoing Nakba, in which Israel gradually forces them out of Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories it captured during the 1967 war that the Palestinians want for a future state. They point to home demolitions, settlement construction and other discriminatory policies that long predate the war, and which major rights groups say amount to apartheid, allegations Israel denies.",
      "Asi and others fear that if another genuine Nakba occurs, it will be in the form of a gradual departure.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be called forcible displacement in some cases. It will be called emigration, it will be called something else,\" Asi said.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- The Anglican Church leadership in South Africa has admitted to failing to disclose sexual abuse allegations against its former member John Smyth, who mistreated children in the 1970s and 1980s in the U.K. and Zimbabwe before fleeing to South Africa, where he died in 2018.",
      "In November, an independent review found the Church of England covered up \u201chorrific\u201d abuse by Smyth, who volunteered at Christian summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s.",
      "A South African panel, headed by a retired judge, released its own report Tuesday in which it said the Anglican Church should have reported Smyth, even though there was no evidence that he had committed similar abuses in the country. Nevertheless, the risk that he would reoffend was high, the panel found.",

      "The Jewish population in the West Bank grew at twice the rate of the general Israeli population last year",
      "BEIT EL, West Bank -- The Jewish population in the West Bank grew at twice the rate of the general Israeli population last year, according to an advocacy group that hopes the Trump administration will support policies that help accelerate the growth of settlements in the occupied territory.",
      "The West Bank's Jewish-settler population rose by roughly 2.3% \u2014 over 12,000 people \u2014 last year, reaching 529,450, according to a report by West Bank Jewish Population Stats.",
      "That was a slight dip from the 2.9% growth rate in 2023, but roughly double the 1.1% population growth rate inside Israel proper.",
      "The number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank could grow \u201cmuch higher\u201d under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Baruch Gordon, the director of the group that publishes the data, said Tuesday.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has built about 130 settlements and dozens of settlement outposts in a bid to cement its control over the territory. The Palestinians seek the area as the heartland of a future state and say the presence of settlements makes independence impossible.",
      "Nearly all of the international community, including the former Biden administration, opposes the settlements as obstacles to peace.",
      "The International Court of Justice ruled in July that the occupation of the West Bank was illegal and said that it violated Palestinians' right to self-determination. It said Israeli policy in the territories constituted \u201csystemic discrimination\u201d based on religion, race or ethnic origin, and that Israel had already effectively annexed large parts of the territory.",
      "During his first term, Trump broke with the international community and years of American policy. He developed close ties with settler leaders and presented a peace plan that would allow Israel to annex large parts of the West Bank and keep all of its settlements.",
      "That track record has raised hopes among Israel\u2019s settlers that they could be entering a new period of rapid growth. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is dominated by settler supporters and he has placed a prominent settler leader, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, in charge of settlement planning.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see an explosion of the construction here,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "Gordon\u2019s group projects the Jewish population in the West Bank will surpass 600,000 by 2030. There are roughly 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank.",
      "The report does not include east Jerusalem, where it estimates 340,000 Jewish settlers live. Israel says these settlers are residents of neighborhoods of its capital, while the international community considers these areas to be settlements.",
      "Inside the gated settlement of Beit El, on a hilltop abutting several Palestinian villages in the central West Bank, construction is continuing apace. It\u2019s a rapidly developing community, where high-rise luxury condominiums finished last year can now house 300 families and construction workers are working on a new dormitory for a Jewish seminary.",
      "Settlers like Gordon say Israel must keep the territory for security and spiritual reasons. \u201cThis is our biblical heartland,\u201d he says.",
      "But critics say the settlement expansion is a recipe for continued conflict. The military last month launched a large-scale operation in the northern West Bank last month, in part as a response to militant attacks on settlements.",
      "The United Nations says over 800 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since Hamas\u2019 attack on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. It also has reported a jump in settler attacks on Palestinians.",
      "Israel says its military offensives are aimed at militants, but stone throwers and uninvolved civilians have also been killed in the crackdown."

      "NEW DELHI -- The resurgent Hindu nationalist party of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is eyeing a state legislature election in Delhi where it is looking to unseat the governing movement which has led the Indian capital for over a decade but has recently been embroiled in graft allegations.",
      "Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, which failed to secure a majority of its own in last year's national election but formed the government with coalition partners, has gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states. It is up against the Aam Aadmi Party, or AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, that runs Delhi and has built a huge support base on the back of its popular welfare policies.",
      "Delhi, a city of more than 20 million people, is a federal territory which Modi\u2019s party has not been able to win for over 27 years, despite having a sizeable support base in the capital.",

      "\u201cPublicity wise, the BJP seems ahead of the AAP because it has more significant resources,\u201d said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, who added that it will be difficult for the BJP to dislodge the AAP because of its popularity among voters.",
      "India\u2019s main opposition Congress party is also in the Delhi race, but many poll experts believe it has run a lackluster campaign and is expected to fare poorly.",
      "Claiming himself to be an anti-corruption crusader, Kejriwal is Delhi\u2019s former top elected official and a fierce critic of Modi. He formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger against the then Congress party government over a series of corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women.",
      "Kejriwal was, however, arrested last year along with two key leaders of his party ahead of national elections on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. The accusations have been consistently denied as part of an alleged political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail.",
      "Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister\u2019s post to his most senior party leader, Atishi, and said he would submit himself to the court of public opinion.",
      "Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal\u2019s arrest, accusing the Modi's government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents, and pointed to several raids, arrests, and corruption investigations of key opposition figures in the months before the national election.",
      "Past voting pattern in the capital shows the distinction voter have made between national and state legislature elections. Since Modi came to power in 2014, his party has often dominated both polls. But in Delhi people have voted differently \u2014 for the AAP in state election and the BJP in national polls.",
      "During election campaigning, Modi\u2019s party reminded voters of graft allegations against Kejriwal, hoping the incumbent party\u2019s corruption allegations will outweigh its popular welfare programs.",
      "The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years. In the 2015 elections, AAP won a landslide victory by capturing 67 of 70 seats.",
      "Kejriwal's AAP has focused on economic development issues, like health care and education in poll rallies. He has avoided talking about the corruption allegations against him, instead asking voters to reward the party for its track record of delivering better services.",
      "\u201cI am not here for Aam Aadmi Party. I am here for the progress of Delhi. I am here for the progress of your families, and to provide a future for your children,\" Kejriwal told a recent campaign rally.",
      "For some supporters of Kejriwal, the campaign has struck a chord. \u201cAll the allegations (against Kejriwal) are false. Whenever a true leader contests elections, he has to face such struggles. He is with us and he is like our brother,\" said Pooja Lamba, a Delhi homemaker.",

      "The M23 rebels on Monday announced the ceasefire on humanitarian grounds after pleas for the safe passage of aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. But Congo's government has described the ceasefire as \u201cfalse communication,\" and the United Nations has noted reports of heavy fighting with Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region.",
      "N\u00e9n\u00e9 Bintou, president of the civil society of South Kivu province, told the AP that the mining city of Nyabibwe was under the control of the M23. The city is midway between Bukavu and Goma, the city the rebels seized last week and still control.",
      "\u201cThey have taken over the city of Nyabibwe since this morning from 9 a.m.,\" said Mo\u00efse Bisimwa, a resident reached by phone. \u201cSo we are here, we are worried about the situation. Apparently the ceasefire that was declared by the M23 is just smoke and mirrors.\u201d",
      "After seizing control of Goma, a provincial capital of 2 million people at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, the rebels were reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on Bukavu.",

      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. That\u2019s far more than in 2012, when they briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure.

    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Donald Trump's \u201cinfluential\u201d billionaire adviser Elon Musk a day after the new U.S. president promised to cut funding for South Africa over a land expropriation law, Ramaphosa's spokesperson said Wednesday.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s conversation with Musk was \u201clogical,\u201d spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said, because the South African-born Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur has held previous investment-related discussions with Ramaphosa and is a Trump ally.",
      "The land law, which was signed by Ramaphosa last month, is contentious because it gives the government scope to expropriate land from private parties.",
      "Trump announced Sunday that he would stop financial assistance while the U.S. investigated why South Africa was \u201cconfiscating land\u201d from some people, without saying who. He told reporters wrongly that the South African government was taking away land and \u201cactually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d Trump again didn\u2019t provide details.",
      "The South African government said Trump\u2019s announcement and related criticism of the country by Musk was full of \u201cmisinformation and distortions\u201d and the call to Musk was to set the record straight.",
      "Musk, who is leading the Trump administration\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, has long criticized the government in his homeland, a key U.S. trading partner in Africa, as being anti-white and has cast the law in question as a deliberate act to take land away from its white minority.",
      "He faces scrutiny in the U.S. for his control over parts of the federal government, but the South Africa issue also shows his influence on U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Should Trump follow through on his promise to cut South Africa\u2019s funding, it would stop nearly half a billion dollars a year in assistance, the vast majority of it for the world\u2019s biggest HIV/AIDS program.",
      "South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world at more than 8 million, with around 5.5 million on antiretroviral medication. The U.S. funds around 17% of South Africa's HIV program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, and gave the country $440 million in assistance last year.",
      "The South African government said no land has been confiscated, and even groups in South Africa that have been critical of the new law said Trump was wrong in claiming any land had been taken away.",
      "\u201cWe will respond expeditiously to disinformation and mischaracterization of our laws as well as the general state of the country,\u201d Magwenya, Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe were obviously perturbed by the substance of the announcement (by Trump) because there were clearly inaccuracies.\u201d",
      "Magwenya said South Africa hoped to have more engagements with the Trump administration at various levels, including with \u201cinfluential figures like Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "The new law targets land that is unused or not being utilized in the public interest, and property rights are protected, according to the government. No land has been taken under the law, which was only signed by Ramaphosa two weeks ago and is a result of years of consultations and Parliamentary debates.",
      "It is designed to address some of the wrongs of South Africa\u2019s previous apartheid regime of white minority rule, where Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in designated areas for non-whites. The last land audit in South Africa estimated that whites \u2014 who make up 7% of the population of 62 million \u2014 own around 70% of land.",
      "In addition to the land law, Musk, who grew up in South Africa, has criticized its affirmative action policies and has falsely claimed that the killings of some white farmers amount to \u201cgenocide.\u201d The killings have been condemned but experts say they are part of South Africa\u2019s appallingly high levels of violent crime and are generally connected to farm robberies.",
      "Musk has put forward an overriding view that South African authorities are racist against their white citizens, but his stance has also become intertwined with his business interests. Musk accused South Africa on his social media site X this week of having \u201cracist ownership laws.\u201d",
      "While it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what he was referencing, it appeared to be the country\u2019s affirmative action laws that require part-Black ownership of some companies, also an attempt to rectify historic wrongs under apartheid, which ended in 1994. Musk left South Africa after completing high school in the late 1980s and moved to Canada.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn\u2019t meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "Ramaphosa held prior discussions with Musk over the possibility of him investing in South Africa, Magwenya said. \u201cHis (Musk\u2019s) particular issues were around Starlink, as well as the regulatory environment that regulates that sector.\u201d",

Grossi did not condemn either side for attacks on the plant saying because it lay so close to the front line it was hard to determine responsibility.",
      "More than half of Ukraine\u2019s power is generated by three functioning nuclear plants and Russia has increasingly threatened their ability to function.",
      "Meanwhile, the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is not under Ukraine's control, in the southeast of the country, was occupied by Russia in the opening days of the full-scale invasion. It is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world.",
      "Grossi visited an electrical substation in the Kyiv region of Ukraine Tuesday and said that damage to such key power grid facilities during the war poses a threat to nuclear safety by potentially disrupting vital cooling procedures at atomic plants.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to cripple Ukraine\u2019s power grid, denying the country heat, electricity and running water in an effort to break the Ukrainian spirit. The attacks have also sought to disrupt Ukraine\u2019s defense manufacturing industry.",
      "The war has brought fears of a nuclear catastrophe as Zaporizhzhia has repeatedly been caught in the crossfire of fighting, and while its six reactors have been shut down for months, it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features.",
      "Russia has been attacking electricity substations which can also threaten nuclear safety.",
      "When substations providing electricity to nuclear plants are damaged or cease to function, Grossi said, emergency diesel generators at nuclear plants become the \u201clast line of defense\u201d against disaster.",
      "\u201cAnd when you have a big nuclear power plant, you don\u2019t want to be at the last line of defense,\u201d Grossi told The Associated Press in an interview during his visit.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to forcibly transfer hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and develop faces some major obstacle",
      "President Donald Trump's stunning proposal to forcibly transfer hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and develop it as a tourist destination faces major obstacles.",
      "The Palestinians and many others view such plans as ethnic cleansing, an attempt to drive them from their homeland after Israel's 15-month offensive against Hamas rendered much of it uninhabitable. It was also seen as an attempt to liquidate their decades-long struggle for a state, which has wide international support.",
      "Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan \u2014 close U.S. allies at peace with Israel \u2014 have condemned such plans and roundly rejected Trump's suggestion that they take in more Palestinian refugees.",
      "Saudi Arabia issued a rare overnight statement rejecting the idea of transfer and reiterating that it won't normalize relations with Israel \u2014 a key goal of the Trump administration \u2014 without the establishment of a Palestinian state including Gaza.",
      "The proposal also risks undermining the ceasefire in Gaza and the continued release of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Trump has claimed credit for brokering the truce, but its future is now more uncertain.",
      "Palestinians view Gaza as an integral part of their national homeland and aspire to an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Most of Gaza's population are descendants of refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out of what is now Israel. They were not allowed to return because they would have outnumbered the new state's Jewish population.",
      "The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, suggested that if Trump's goal is to send the Palestinians to a \u201chappy, nice place,\u201d they should return to their ancestral homes in Israel.",
      "The ideal of remaining on one's land despite threats of expulsion is at the heart of the Palestinians' struggle and self-identity, and was on vivid display last week when hundreds of thousands returned to northern Gaza despite its near-total destruction.",
      "Both Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which recognizes Israel and cooperates with it on security, have vehemently condemned Trump's proposal.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, have repeatedly rejected previous proposals to resettle Palestinians within their borders.",
      "They too fear that Israel would never allow the Palestinians to return, and that a mass influx of Palestinian refugees would once again destabilize the region, as it did in the decades after 1948, when it was a key factor in Lebanon's civil war and Israel's two invasions of that country. Both countries also have struggling economies that would have a hard time absorbing large numbers of refugees.",
      "Trump suggested that wealthy Gulf countries could pay to resettle the Palestinians, but that appears unlikely.",
      "Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting any transfer plans, and the Saudis repudiated the plan almost immediately.",
      "The Saudi statement reiterated remarks made in September by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who said Saudi Arabia would not normalize relations with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.",
      "The kingdom said its \u201cunwavering position is non-negotiable and not subject to compromises.\u201d",
      "Trump seems to relish using tariffs, sanctions and aid cutoffs to pressure allies and adversaries alike, and could apply economic pressure on countries like Egypt and Jordan, which have long relied on American aid.",
      "But those countries have levers of their own in the face of what they see as a major threat to their national security. And wealthy Gulf countries, which have also historically provided aid to Egypt and Jordan, could help cushion any economic blow.",
      "Egypt has already warned that any mass transfer of Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula bordering Gaza could undermine its peace treaty with Israel \u2014 a cornerstone of regional stability and American influence for nearly a half-century.",
      "Egypt and Qatar have also served as key mediators with Hamas in the talks that led to the ceasefire, and both are working with Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to try to extend it.",
      "The idea of mass transfer has historically been confined to the far-right in Israel, but on Wednesday, mainstream leaders said Trump's plan was worth considering.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the press conference with Trump, acknowledged that \u201cjaws drop\u201d when the U.S. president proposes unorthodox ideas, but then \u201cpeople scratch their heads and they say, \u2018You know, he\u2019s right.'\"",
      "Benny Gantz, a centrist politician and former general long seen as a more moderate alternative to Netanyahu, said Trump\u2019s proposal showed \u201ccreative, original and intriguing thinking,\u201d and should be studied alongside other war goals, \u201cprioritizing the return of all the hostages.\u201d",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid, a fierce critic of Netanyahu who has voiced support for a two-state solution in the past, did not object to the idea. Instead, he said in an interview with local media that it was too early to react to Trump\u2019s proposal since there are no concrete details, and that returning the hostages was most important.",
      "The current phase of the Gaza ceasefire, in which Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, ends in early March. The second phase, in which the remaining 60 or so hostages would be freed in exchange for more prisoners, is being negotiated.",
      "Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal \u2014 which would likely preclude any forcible transfer.",
      "Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who supports what he refers to as the \u201cvoluntary emigration\u201d of large numbers of Palestinians and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza, has threatened to leave Netanyahu's coalition if he doesn't resume the war after the first phase, which would likely lead to early elections. He welcomed Trump's proposal.",
      "The resumption of the war would put the remaining hostages' lives at risk, and there's no guarantee it would eliminate Hamas, which still controls most of Gaza. It would also undo what Trump has portrayed as a major accomplishment and further delay any normalization with Saudi Arabia.",
      "There's another possibility: That Trump's proposal is an opening gambit in a bargaining process aimed at eventually securing the kind of Middle East mega-deal he says he is seeking.",
      "It was only last week that Trump was threatening major tariffs against Canada and Mexico, America's two biggest trading partners, before putting them on hold after their leaders took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "During his first term, Trump flirted with the possibility of Israel annexing parts of the occupied West Bank before the idea was shelved as part of a normalization agreement with the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Trump could ultimately pare down his proposal or put it on hold in exchange for concessions from Arab leaders, perhaps on Gaza's reconstruction or on normalization with Israel \u2014 though the Saudi statement appeared to rule that out.",
      "There could be more clarity when the shock wears off, and when Trump meets with Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House next week.",

      "Despite more than a year of warnings that critical Ukrainian nuclear energy infrastructure sites are vulnerable to potential Russian attacks, Ukraine's Energy Ministry has failed to act swiftly to protect them, government officials have told The Associ...",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Moscow\u2019s renewed attacks on Ukraine\u2019s electricity infrastructure this winter have heightened scrutiny over the Ukrainian Energy Ministry's failure to protect the country\u2019s most critical energy facilities near nuclear power sites.",
      "Despite more than a year of warnings that the sites were vulnerable to potential Russian attacks, the Energy Ministry failed to act swiftly, current and former Ukrainian officials in Kyiv told The Associated Press.",
      "Two years of punishing Russian strikes on its power grid have left Ukraine reliant on nuclear power for more than half of its electricity generation. Especially vulnerable are the unprotected nuclear switchyards located outside the perimeters of its three functioning nuclear plants, which are crucial to transmitting power from the reactors to the rest of the country.",
      "\u201cThe switchyards that handle electrical routing from nuclear power plants are a vital component of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear energy infrastructure \u2014 powering homes, schools, hospitals and other critical civilian infrastructure,\" said Marcy R. Fowler, head of the office for research and analysis at Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens that focuses on reducing nuclear risk.",
      "\u201cGiven Ukraine\u2019s heavy reliance on nuclear energy, military attacks on these switchyards would be devastating, severely impacting civilian life and undermining the resilience of the energy grid,\u201d she said.",
      "Only in the fall, after Ukrainian intelligence agencies warned of potential Russian strikes targeting the nuclear switchyards, was action taken to begin building protection \u2014 far too late in the event of an attack, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf two (nuclear switchyards) are hit, we are out of supply for a minimum of 30 to 36 hours, and there will be a huge limitation on energy supply for at least three weeks, best-case scenario,\u201d said Oleksandr Kharchenko, a Ukrainian energy industry expert.",
      "He said it would take three to five weeks to transport and install new equipment, a miserable scenario for Ukraine's people during the bitterly cold winter months.",
      "Even more worrying, nuclear switchyards also have a second critical function: delivering electricity to nuclear plants from the offsite grid that is essential to cooling their reactors and spent fuel. A disruption could potentially spell disaster, the U.N. nuclear agency has repeatedly warned since the Russian attacks began in August.",
      "And while Ukraine's nuclear plants have backup emergency power systems, these \u201care designed to provide temporary support,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cWithout functioning switchyards, the backup systems alone would not be sufficient to sustain operations or prevent safety risks during an extended outage.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers cited failure to protect these sites in a resolution last month calling for the removal of Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko. The list of grievances, which also censured Haluschenko for alleged systematic corruption and inadequate oversight of the energy sector, must still be voted on by parliament.",
      "Haluschenko maintained at a news conference Tuesday the allegations were \u201ca manipulation\u201d and that fortifications for the electrical grid were \u201cdone.\u201d But he would not answer direct questions about whether Ukraine's nuclear switchyards in particular were protected.",
      "\u201cToday we have light, we have no restrictions\" on electricity, he said, suggesting that was proof that despite \u201cmassive attacks\u201d on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, fortifications were in place.",
      "Russian attacks in November and December came dangerously close to the country\u2019s nuclear power plants, causing five out of its nine operating reactors to reduce power generation. The attacks did not strike the nuclear switchyards about a kilometer (half-mile) away from reactor sites but came alarmingly close.",
      "The task of building protections for energy transmission substations, both nuclear and non-nuclear, fell to state and private companies, with the Energy Ministry supervising.",
      "Three layers of fortifications were ordered: sandbags followed by cement barricades capable of withstanding drone attacks and \u2014 the most costly and least complete \u2014 iron-and-steel-fortified structures.",
      "Following a government decree in July 2023, many state energy companies began immediately contracting to build first- and second-layer fortifications for their most critical power facilities. In the spring of 2024, the government repeated the urgent call to get the work done.",
      "But nuclear switchyards, under the responsibility of Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom, did not issue contracts to build second-layer concrete fortifications until this fall. By then, state energy company Ukrenergo, which manages the high-voltage substations that transmit power from the nuclear reactors to the grid, had already completed 90% of its 43 sites.",
      "The bidding process for two nuclear plants \u2014 in Khmelnytskyi and Mykolaiv \u2014 only started in early October, according to documents seen by the AP. The tender for the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant was even later, at the end of November.",
      "Construction is not expected to be completed until 2026, the contract documents said.",
      "Concerns over the delays were raised repeatedly in closed-door meetings and letters sent to energy officials over the last year, three current and former government officials told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the foot-dragging by the Energy Ministry.",
      "\u201cWe wrote officially to the Energy Ministry several times stating this problem over the last 12 to 14 months,\u201d said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the former head of Ukrenergo, who was fired in September and blamed for the failures to protect the energy infrastructure \u2014 a move widely criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Energy Minister Haluschenko gave reassurances the situation was under control and prioritized other projects, including lobbying for parliamentary approval for the construction of costly nuclear reactors that take up to a decade to build.",

In mid-December it convened an extraordinary session of the International Atomic Energy Agency after attacks a month earlier damaged electrical substations deemed crucial to Ukraine\u2019s nuclear safety, heightening the possibility of a nuclear emergency.",

      "A 50-year-old West Africa regional bloc is facing significant challenges after three junta-led countries \u2014 Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso \u2014 formally left the group, known as ECOWAS",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- West Africa's regional bloc known as ECOWAS is facing significant challenges after three junta-led countries formally quit the group, forming their own alliance and weakening the bloc's standing and political authority.",
      "The withdrawal of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso from the bloc \u2014 now left with 12 member countries \u2014 was the culmination of a yearlong period of talks and diplomatic efforts aimed at trying to get them to reverse their decision, announced in January 2024.",
      "The departures were the first of its kind in the bloc's 50-year historys and analysts warn that a weaker ECOWAS could further undermine the increasingly fragile region.",
      "Widely seen as West Africa\u2019s leading political and regional authority, the 15-nation bloc was formed in 1975 to \u201cpromote economic integration\u201d among its member states. The bloc has also often collaborated with members to solve domestic challenges, from politics to economics and security.",
      "The bloc guarantees its members visa-free travel and access to a more than $700 billion market for a population of around 400 million people.",
      "However, in parts of West Africa, analysts say ECOWAS suffers from a legitimacy crisis, with citizens seeing it as representing only the interests of leaders and not theirs.",
      "Relations between ECOWAS and the coup-hit Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso began to deteriorate after the bloc imposed stringent sanctions on Niger to pressure its military to reverse the coup it had staged.",
      "The bloc has long used sanctions as a key tool in trying to reverse coups but those imposed on Niger were the harshest yet. Neighbors shut borders with the country, cut off more than 70% of Niger's electricity supply, suspended financial transactions and froze Niger's assets held by the bloc.",
      "The three countries called the sanctions \u201cinhumane\u201d and accused ECOWAS of \u201cmoving away from the ideals of its founding fathers and pan-Africanism.\u201d",
      "After leaving ECOWAS, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso created their own alliance known as the Alliance of Sahel States, or AES, named after the vast southern fringe of the Sahara Desert region.",
      "The three severed military ties with longstanding Western partners, including the United States and France, and turned to Russia for military support.",
      "ECOWAS has attempted to ease tensions with the AES, reversing last February the sanctions that the bloc had imposed and trying to revamp talks, which the AES rebuffed.",
      "Although ECOWAS has said it would leave the doors open for the three nations to continue to enjoy benefits as other bloc members do, the three junta-led countries are launching their own travel documents for their citizens.",
      "The bloc has also said that trade would continue as usual. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are still members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union \u2014 meaning trade and free movement of goods should continue among its eight-nation members. The monetary union includes the three junta-led countries as well as Senegal, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Togo and Benin.",
      "Officially, a six-month extension for talks between ECOWAS and the three countries expires in July, said Babacar Ndiaye, a political analyst at the West Africa-focused Wathi think tank. But there is little expectation that the AES countries would \"reconsider their withdrawal,\u201d Ndiaye said.",
      "There are concerns a weakened ECOWAS would be unable to handle security crises spreading from the conflict-battered Sahel to coastal West African nations.",
      "ECOWAS is also unlikely to be in a position to try and reverse the military takeovers in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. There will also likely be fewer investments in the three countries, which are among the region's poorest, said Charlie Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital."

    "story": [
      "Maryland officials have unveiled their designs for replacing Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge almost a year after it collapsed under the weight of a cargo ship that lost power and veered off course",
      "SPARROWS POINT, Md. -- Almost a year after the deadly collapse of Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge, Maryland officials on Tuesday unveiled their designs for its replacement, which will be taller and better protected against ship strikes.",
      "Construction of the state\u2019s first cable-stayed bridge could be completed in 2028 and cost upwards of $1.7 billion.",
      "With its graceful outline and delicate design, officials said the new bridge will modernize Baltimore\u2019s skyline, becoming a symbol of resilience, progress and economic growth. The design features two towers with cables radiating down to the deck.",
      "\u201cThis is a great day for the state of Maryland,\u201d Gov. Wes Moore said at a news conference late Tuesday morning. \u201cBut it\u2019s not lost on me that today\u2019s triumph was born out of tragedy.\u201d",
      "The original Key Bridge, a 1.6-mile (2.6-kilometer) steel span at the mouth of Baltimore\u2019s harbor, took five years to construct and opened to traffic in 1977. It connected various port-oriented industrial communities around Baltimore and allowed drivers to easily bypass downtown.",
      "The bridge was destroyed when a massive container ship lost power and slammed into one of its supporting columns. The March 26 collapse killed six construction workers who were filling potholes when the structure crumbled beneath them. Baltimore\u2019s port was closed for months after the collapse, and increased traffic congestion remains a problem for drivers across the region.",
      "Officials quickly promised to rebuild the bridge \u2014 a longstanding Baltimore landmark and vital piece of transportation infrastructure.",
      "Demolition of the remaining pieces will take place this spring, with construction of its replacement to follow, officials said Tuesday.",
      "They held Tuesday\u2019s news conference at Tradepoint Atlantic, a shipping hub in the Port of Baltimore that played a major role in cleanup and recovery efforts following the collapse. The facility is revitalizing the site of a former Bethlehem Steel plant just northeast of Baltimore as maritime shipping continues to fuel the regional economy.",
      "\u201cMaryland is a bridge between America and the rest of the world. We get cars from Michigan out to market. We bring sugars and spices to Louisiana. We haul farm equipment from the East Coast deep into the heartland,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCommerce and trade are the bedrock of our state, and we will continue to make investments that honor our tradition.\u201d",
      "In August, the state awarded a $73 million contract for the first phase of the rebuild to Kiewit Infrastructure, a major construction and engineering firm.",
      "Officials said the project would advance in two phases, with the first focusing on the design work and other necessary steps before construction begins. Moore promised to \u201cemploy many Marylanders\u201d throughout the process.",
      "Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said the design will include the latest in pier protection technology, which has become increasingly important as ships keep getting bigger and carrying more cargo. The bridge will also be taller to provide more clearance. He said the plans were developed with the project\u2019s cost and construction timeline in mind.",
      "\u201cWhile this is a beautiful bridge, it will also be a working bridge for a working city,\u201d Wiedefeld said.",
      "The federal government has agreed to cover the full price tag for rebuilding. Congress recently passed a spending bill that included a funding provision for the project.",
      "Officials have said they expect that federal taxpayers will eventually be made whole through insurance payouts and damages, but that could take a while. A sprawling civil case will ultimately determine the assignments of liability in what could become one of the most expensive maritime disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has not yet released its final report on the collapse, though officials said a loose cable in the ship\u2019s electrical switchboard likely contributed to its power issues. Federal agents boarded the cargo ship Dali amid a criminal investigation last year."

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products",
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, while the U.S. Postal Service announced it will stop accepting parcels inbound from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "Next-door neighbors lost their near-identical homes in a California wildfire, but how they are navigating rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, a stark reflection of the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\u201cI chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\u201d said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they\u2019ll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\u201cIt changes the whole trajectory to your life,\u201d said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin\u2019s home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can\u2019t get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.\u2019\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \u201cdifficult but purposeful business decisions\u201d in California.",
      "Mercury didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson\u2019s case, and noted that it\u2019s difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn\u2019t cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\u201cBeing able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\u201d Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\u201cHalf the time, I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\u201cI could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It\u2019s just luck, really. It\u2019s nothing I did or didn\u2019t do,\u201d Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \u201cI had the same risk factors as everyone else.\u201d",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all trying to manage their exposure,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIf you think about wildfires, you don\u2019t want concentrated exposure.\u201d",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn\u2019t get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that\u2019s very, very painful,\u201d said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \u201cdone everything the insurers asked California to do\u201d but yielded little success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we\u2019re not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of risk in the system and there\u2019s a big question of who is going to pay for this,\u201d Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he\u2019ll have to take out loans to rebuild. He\u2019s considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can\u2019t fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he\u2019s thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cStuck paying for an insurance that doesn\u2019t cover anything. You don\u2019t want to live in a risky area. You don\u2019t have the safety net.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- It\u2019s one thing to fix your home after something basic has gone wrong, but it\u2019s a different beast to rebuild and recover after a major natural disaster has destroyed multiple properties on your street, in your neighborhood or across the region.",
      "Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re in crisis mode to figure out what to expect. It's important to understand your benefits and rights when it comes to home insurance in the event of a widespread emergency.",
      "Insurance is meant to cover what you lost, but that can mean two very different things.",
      "If you do nothing else, check your policy now to see if you have \u201creplacement cost value\u201d coverage. That\u2019s the comprehensive standard, which will grant you the amount of money needed to get a new replacement of what you lost in case of a major disaster like a wildfire.",
      "If you have \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, that means the dollar limits listed are only intended to cover the value of what you lost, which factors in depreciation at the time of the event.",
      "Amy Bach of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders says the two are apples and oranges in terms of payouts. She describes it this way: \u201cActual cash value is the Craigslist price. It\u2019s not the replacement cost price.\u201d",
      "From finding a new place to live to buying yourself clothes and toiletries, it\u2019s expensive to survive the immediate aftermath of an emergency, so get familiar with any state laws regulating insurance companies on advanced payments.",
      "For example, California, which has some of the strongest consumer protections in the nation, requires insurers to quickly pay out up to $250,000, or the equivalent of 30% of the policy\u2019s dwelling coverage limit, when a state of emergency has been declared and the home is known to be a total loss. This is considered an advanced payment, which doesn\u2019t require the homeowner to first itemize all their destroyed belongings or wait for an adjuster to access the site of the property.",
      "If you aren\u2019t able to connect with your insurer, look for emergency response centers in your community, which should provide state and federal troubleshooters to assist. They may also have information on what other aid, grants and subsidies are available to you in conjunction with or separate from your insurance benefits. Local businesses may also be there to offer freebies such as furniture or clothing.",
      "You will likely be displaced for months, or even years depending on how widespread the disaster was. For major wildfires, cleaning up the toxic burned site can take just as long as the entire new construction effort.",
      "And during that time, you must continue to pay the mortgage on a property you can't occupy.",
      "Property insurance generally refers to the cost of living while displaced as \u201closs of use\u201d coverage, which is also sometimes known as \u201cadditional living expense\u201d or \u201cfair rental value.\u201d",
      "Check this line item to ask yourself if you would have enough to get by paying for both your mortgage and a temporary rental."

      "Italy\u2019s justice minister has strongly defended the government\u2019s decision to free and repatriate a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court",
      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s justice minister strongly defended the government's decision to repatriate a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court, saying Wednesday that the court itself had made an \"immense mess\u201d of the case by issuing a contradictory and flawed arrest warrant.",
      "Justice Minister Carlo Nordio told the lower chamber of parliament that he was right to proceed carefully with the Jan. 18 warrant against Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, who is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "He said that The Hague-based court later \u201ccorrected, or rather completely overturned the previous warrant\u201d by changing the timespan of al-Masri\u2019s alleged crimes.",
      "\u201cThe court itself detected them and tried to change them five days later, because it realized that an immense mess was made,\u201d he told the Chamber of Deputies.",
      "The Italian government has been under fire from the ICC, human rights groups and opposition lawmakers ever since it freed al-Masri from prison on Jan. 21 and sent him back to Libya aboard an Italian military aircraft. Al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force.",
      "The ICC warrant available on the court's website accuses al-Masri of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Mitiga prison in Libya starting in 2015 that are punishable with life in prison. The ICC said he was accused of murder, torture, rape and sexual violence.",
      "Al-Masri was arrested in Turin on the ICC warrant on Jan. 19 at 9:30 a.m., the day after he arrived in the country from Germany to watch a soccer match. The Italian government has said Rome\u2019s court of appeals ordered him released Jan. 21 because of a technical problem in the way that the ICC warrant was transmitted, having initially bypassed the Italian justice ministry.",
      "Nordio repeated that argument Wednesday, saying that he only received an \u201cinformal email of a few lines\u201d from Interpol three hours after al-Masri was arrested.",
      "But he added that the text of the original Jan. 18 warrant itself was full of contradictions, specifically the timespan during which al-Masri allegedly committed his crimes. While the text of the warrant spoke of crimes allegedly occurring between 2015-2024, the conclusions referred to crimes allegedly committed from \u201c2011 onwards.\u201d",
      "\u201cAn irreconcilable contradiction emerges regarding an essential element of the arrestee\u2019s criminal conduct, regarding the time of the crime committed,\u201d Nordio said.",
      "When the court announced it was unsealing the warrant on Jan. 24, it said that it was issuing an updated warrant to \u201ccorrect certain typographical and clerical errors.\u201d The revised warrant speaks only of alleged crimes between 2015-2024.",
      "Human rights groups have blasted Italy\u2019s repatriation of al-Masri as a serious breach of its obligations as a founding member of the court. According to Article 89 of the Rome Statute, the 1998 treaty that gave birth to the ICC, member states must \u201ccomply with requests for arrest and surrender.\u201d",
      "And opposition lawmakers have seized on the case to attack Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni. They have demanded that Meloni herself brief parliament, and on Wednesday they held up signs saying \u201cMeloni the patriot at large\u201d in the chamber.",
      "Italy has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, on whom it relies to patrol its coasts and prevent migrants from leaving. Opposition politicians have accused the government of essentially caving to the threat that Libyan militias might have unleashed boatloads of migrants had al-Masri been handed over to the ICC.",
      "Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who also briefed Parliament on Wednesday, denied al-Masri was ever an interlocutor with the government on the migration issue. And he denied that Italy had received any threats in connection with his arrest.",
      "Opposition leader Elly Schlein of the Democratic Party blasted Nordio\u2019s presentation, saying that his legalistic arguments about the ICC warrant were misplaced and that he had no role to evaluate an arrest warrant from the court.",
      "\u201cMinister Nordio, you didn\u2019t speak to this chamber as a minister, but as the defense lawyer of a torturer,\u201d Schlein said.",
      "Nordio\u2019s attack on the ICC warrant is in line with the government\u2019s overall attempt to focus attention on the judiciary\u2019s role in the al-Masri saga.",
      "Last week, Rome\u2019s chief prosecutor informed Meloni, Nordio, Piatendosi and another government official that they were being investigated for allegedly favoring irregular migration by repatriating al-Masri. Meloni has spent days complaining about Italy's politicized judiciary, echoing a frequent line of attack taken by her onetime ally, the late former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.",
      "But Meloni has also acknowledged that national security issues came into play in the al-Masri case: In an X post on Jan. 29, Meloni framed the issue as a matter of defending Italy.",
      "\u201cWhen the security of the national and the interests of Italians are in play, there is no room for backing down,\u201d she wrote.",

      "A Japanese appeals court upheld the conviction of a former American Nissan executive for helping fugitive former Chairman Carlos Ghosn hide income, while rejecting prosecutors\u2019 bid to overturn his acquitals on other counts",
      "TOKYO -- The conviction of a former American Nissan executive for helping fugitive former Chairman Carlos Ghosn hide income was upheld by a Japanese appeals court Tuesday, which also rejected prosecutors' bid to overturn his acquitals on other counts.",
      "Greg Kelly, a lawyer and former executive vice president at Nissan Motor Corp, was convicted in 2022 of charges related to only one of eight years during which prosecutors said he under-reported Ghosn's income. Kelly, who received a 6-month sentence suspended for three years and was allowed to return to Tennessee, did not attend the hearing.",
      "Yoichi Kitamura, Kelly\u2019s attorney, said he will appeal to the Japanese Supreme Court.",
      "Prosecutors, who sought to overturn Kelly\u2019s acquitals for the other seven years, declined to comment. Both sides have 15 days to appeal.",
      "The latest ruling means the six-year battle over the alleged scheme to hide Ghosn\u2019s pay continues.",
      "Ghosn, who became chairman of Nissan after years working in alliance partner Renault, is widely credited with turning around the Japanese carmaker. He was hailed as a business genius until his relationship with the company broke down for reasons that analysts say are related to his foreign management style in an old-fashioned Japanese company.",
      "Prosecutors and the company said that after the board cut his pay by nearly half, he conspired with Kelly and other company officials to secure secret promises of future compensation.",
      "Ghosn and Kelly were arrested in late 2018 in separate but coordinated operations when they returned to Japan for meetings at Nissan.",
      "Ghosn was charged with underreporting his compensation and with breach of trust. He fled to Lebanon while out on bail in December 2019, hiding in a box for musical instruments carried by two Americans who were later extradited from the U.S., found guilty and served nearly two years in Japan.",
      "Ghosn, who says he is innocent, is unlikely to ever stand trial as Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan.",
      "Kelly has repeatedly said he was merely working for Nissan\u2019s interests, and the issue should have been sorted out in a board room, not a courtroom.",
      "Kelly still faces a civil lawsuit filed by Nissan, alleging 4 billion yen ($26 million) in damages. Nissan, based in the port city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, acknowledged the case is ongoing but declined to comment.",
      "Nissan, having sunk into losses over the last quarter amid drooping sales, is in talks with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. to integrate their business through a joint holding company.",
      "The Ghosn debacle has long been seen in Japan as a reflection of the difficulties in forging international business alliances.",
      "In Japan, less than 1% of criminal cases results in verdicts of innocence, according to the Japan Federation of Bar Associations.",

      "China has countered President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports as well as announcing an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures",
      "BEIJING -- China countered President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports Tuesday as well as announcing an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures.",
      "China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\u201cThe US\u2019s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.\u201d",
      "In addition, China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Trump\u2019s 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico also were to go into effect Tuesday, though Trump agreed to a 30-day pause on his threats against Mexico and Canada as they acted to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trump planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "In addition to the tariffs, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they are essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an unreliable entities list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, which is a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 09:30:26 -0500",
    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Donald Trump's \u201cinfluential\u201d billionaire adviser Elon Musk a day after the new U.S. president promised to cut funding for South Africa over a land expropriation law, Ramaphosa's spokesperson said Wednesday.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s conversation with Musk was \u201clogical,\u201d spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said, because the South African-born Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur has held previous investment-related discussions with Ramaphosa and is a Trump ally.",
      "The land law, which was signed by Ramaphosa last month, is contentious because it gives the government scope to expropriate land from private parties.",
      "Trump announced Sunday that he would stop financial assistance while the U.S. investigated why South Africa was \u201cconfiscating land\u201d from some people, without saying who. He told reporters wrongly that the South African government was taking away land and \u201cactually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d Trump again didn\u2019t provide details.",
      "The South African government said Trump\u2019s announcement and related criticism of the country by Musk was full of \u201cmisinformation and distortions\u201d and the call to Musk was to set the record straight.",
      "Musk, who is leading the Trump administration\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, has long criticized the government in his homeland, a key U.S. trading partner in Africa, as being anti-white and has cast the law in question as a deliberate act to take land away from its white minority.",
      "He faces scrutiny in the U.S. for his control over parts of the federal government, but the South Africa issue also shows his influence on U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Should Trump follow through on his promise to cut South Africa\u2019s funding, it would stop nearly half a billion dollars a year in assistance, the vast majority of it for the world\u2019s biggest HIV/AIDS program.",
      "South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world at more than 8 million, with around 5.5 million on antiretroviral medication. The U.S. funds around 17% of South Africa's HIV program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, and gave the country $440 million in assistance last year.",
      "The South African government said no land has been confiscated, and even groups in South Africa that have been critical of the new law said Trump was wrong in claiming any land had been taken away.",
      "\u201cWe will respond expeditiously to disinformation and mischaracterization of our laws as well as the general state of the country,\u201d Magwenya, Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe were obviously perturbed by the substance of the announcement (by Trump) because there were clearly inaccuracies.\u201d",
      "Magwenya said South Africa hoped to have more engagements with the Trump administration at various levels, including with \u201cinfluential figures like Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "The new law targets land that is unused or not being utilized in the public interest, and property rights are protected, according to the government. No land has been taken under the law, which was only signed by Ramaphosa two weeks ago and is a result of years of consultations and Parliamentary debates.",
      "It is designed to address some of the wrongs of South Africa\u2019s previous apartheid regime of white minority rule, where Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in designated areas for non-whites. The last land audit in South Africa estimated that whites \u2014 who make up 7% of the population of 62 million \u2014 own around 70% of land.",
      "In addition to the land law, Musk, who grew up in South Africa, has criticized its affirmative action policies and has falsely claimed that the killings of some white farmers amount to \u201cgenocide.\u201d The killings have been condemned but experts say they are part of South Africa\u2019s appallingly high levels of violent crime and are generally connected to farm robberies.",
      "Musk has put forward an overriding view that South African authorities are racist against their white citizens, but his stance has also become intertwined with his business interests. Musk accused South Africa on his social media site X this week of having \u201cracist ownership laws.\u201d",
      "While it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what he was referencing, it appeared to be the country\u2019s affirmative action laws that require part-Black ownership of some companies, also an attempt to rectify historic wrongs under apartheid, which ended in 1994. Musk left South Africa after completing high school in the late 1980s and moved to Canada.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn\u2019t meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "Ramaphosa held prior discussions with Musk over the possibility of him investing in South Africa, Magwenya said. \u201cHis (Musk\u2019s) particular issues were around Starlink, as well as the regulatory environment that regulates that sector.\u201d",

      "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Debt-stricken Sri Lanka marked its 77th independence anniversary on Tuesday with a military parade, while the country\u2019s newly elected president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, pledged to heal Sri Lanka's economic woes by the end of his five-year term.",
      "Sri Lanka, which gained independence from Britain in 1948, suffered its worst economic crisis in 2022, forcing the island nation to declare bankruptcy. It also suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans amid a foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and hourslong power cuts.",
      "The economic crisis caused political upheaval and finally paved the way for Dissanayake\u2019s party to win power four months ago.",
      "On Tuesday, Dissanayake said he would improve the living standards of all Sri Lankans during his tenure, giving them opportunities to enjoy modern scientific and technological innovations.",
      "Addressing a ceremony in the capital, Colombo, he urged Sri Lankans to work together to win economic, social and cultural freedom, saying, \u201cEveryone has a role to play in this struggle.\u201d",
      "A military parade followed Dissanayake\u2019s speech.",
      "Under Dissanayake\u2019s leadership, Sri Lanka is trying to emerge from bankruptcy by restructuring its staggering debt.",
      "When Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy, it sought the help of the International Monetary Fund, which approved a $2.9 billion four-year bailout package in 2023, under which Sri Lanka was required to restructure its debt.",
      "In September, Sri Lanka announced it had concluded the debt restructuring process after reaching agreements with bilateral and multilateral creditors and private bond holders.",
      "Sri Lanka is seeking to obtain $17 billion in debt service relief.",
      "Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with 2019 terrorism attacks that devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad."

      "NEW YORK -- A new coalition of nonprofits came together overnight to challenge a seemingly sweeping order from the Trump administration last week pausing trillions of dollars in federal funding. They succeeded in blocking that order, at least for now.",
      "It's the start of what nonprofits expect will be a deluge of court actions, as civil litigation promises to be a powerful tool civil society groups plan to use to push back on President Donald Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cThere will be an avalanche of litigation to stop unlawful activity,\u201d said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which brought the nonprofit coalition\u2019s suit against the federal funding freeze. A judge ruled Monday to allow their lawsuit, one of many filed in the first weeks of the new administration, to move forward and extended a temporary restraining order.",
      "More than a dozen federal lawsuits have already been filed against President Trump and his administration by a wide range of nonprofits, from several Quaker organizations to the consumer rights group Public Citizen to New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support.",
      "Many considered policy changes under the new administration, but few contemplated the total suspension of foreign aid or a widespread pause of federal funding. The federal funding freeze was a moment widely viewed by the nonprofit sector as an existential crisis. And organizations took a range of approaches from keeping their heads down, to organizing community forums, to firing up supporters to contact Congress.",
      "Diane Yentel, the president and CEO the National Council of Nonprofits, moved quickly to take action. She had already been tracking the impact of President Donald Trump's initial executive orders on nonprofits when she saw the memo in the evening on Jan. 27.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget order said: \u201cFederal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.\u201d",

      "Nonprofits and their funders can draw on experiences from the first Trump administration and the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 which created similar upheaval. But many see the federal funding freeze as unprecedented.",
      "Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said access to some of the platforms where nonprofit organizations receive funding was cut off even before the deadline the Trump administration set in its memo, increasing the sense of confusion and panic.",
      "Her organization called on people to contact their representatives in Congress to provide them information about the consequences of this potential funding freeze. At least 10,000 people used their electronic contact form to reach members of Congress, NAEH reported last week.",
      "Grace Bonilla, president of The United Way of New York City, which receives state and local government funding to support food pantries at hundreds of small organizations in New York City, said those organizations are already impacted not just by concerns about funding freezes, but by the administration's other policies, like increased immigration enforcement, for example.",

      "There were some oversized expectations for the animated film but \"Moana 2\", originally intended as a series for the company's streaming service before it was produced for the big screen \u2014 blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing.",

      "For neighbors Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson, the difference in insurance coverage on their nearly identical homes in Altadena reveals how unequal that recovery will be.",
      "Hamlin was privately insured and has already been paid out nearly a million dollars. She is searching for contractors to rebuild her house.",
      "Wilson will receive a fraction of what he needs because he was covered by the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program known as the FAIR Plan. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "The plan is a temporary coverage option created by the state as a last resort for homeowners who can't find private insurance. More Californians are relying on it than ever after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in recent years.",
      "In Wilson\u2019s case, his private insurer declined to renew his policy last year although he offered to install various fire mitigation efforts. No other insurers were willing to write him a new policy, forcing Wilson to get on the FAIR Plan to satisfy his mortgage requirements.",
      "The number of FAIR residential policies issued in the state more than doubled between 2020 and 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies.",
      "Under the FAIR Plan, Wilson paid about 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, though he is slated to receive less than half the coverage. And his true home insurance cost was actually much higher because he also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects.",
      "The Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurers, said the FAIR Plan provides a lifeline for homeowners who cannot find private insurance, and that outcomes would be far worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "State officials have rolled out several new regulations to give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.",
      "Governments also have to shoulder the costs for serious mitigation efforts, or the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, said Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley. California is proposing to direct roughly $25 million from a voter-approved climate bond to bolster fire mitigation requirements around homes.",

      "Rubiales is accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso, the Spain forward, at the 2023 Women's World Cup final presentation ceremony in Sydney, as well as of coercion for allegedly trying to convince the player to support his version of the kiss. Hermoso says she did not consent to the kiss while Rubiales says it was consensual.",

      "The century-old sliding center being completely rebuilt for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games is pushing the deadline really tight",
      "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy -- In Sochi, workers were still hammering away in the media village and shower water ran yellow when journalists from around the world arrived for the 2014 Winter Games.",
      "The chaotic preparations for the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro were labeled the \u201cworst\u201d ever by a vice president of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The next Olympics, though, might set an unofficial record for running late on preparations.",
      "That\u2019s because the century-old sliding center being completely rebuilt for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games is pushing the deadline so tight that the IOC has gone so far as to demand a Plan B option that would require moving bobsled, luge and skeleton events all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy isn\u2019t finished in time.",
      "Thursday marks exactly one year to go before the Feb. 6, 2026 opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium and the track in Cortina is still a half-completed construction site.",
      "The IOC has set a deadline for the end of next month for pre-certification of the Cortina track and nobody is saying for sure if it will pass the test.",
      "But Fabio Saldini, the Italian government commissioner in charge of the 118 million euro ($123 million) project, told The Associated Press during a recent visit that almost 70% of the track was completed \u2014 even if it was tough to tell inside the muddy and chaotic construction site.",
      "With 180 people working from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. every day to build the sliding center, the first ice is slated to be laid down on the track at the start of March.",
      "\u201cWe have huge support from the construction firms, the government and (Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo) Salvini,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cWith everyone\u2019s support, we will be able to finish in time.\u201d",
      "Construction began less than a year ago and no sliding track has been built in such a short timeframe. An official test event is slated for October, a step that has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "The IOC would have preferred to use an active track in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead of rebuilding the Cortina venue, which had been closed since 2008. But it let the local organizing committee select the Plan B option.",
      "\u201cWe chose Lake Placid because it was the only place where they offered us the track without requiring us to make any investments,\u201d Milan-Cortina CEO Andrea Varnier told AP. \u201cBut we\u2019re counting on holding the sliding sports here in Cortina.\u201d",
      "Added organizing committee president Giovanni Malag\u00f2 about the Lake Placid backup plan: \u201cIt's just a formality. There's no substance to it.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups have protested over climate damage due to the Cortina track's reconstruction.",
      "\u201cThere were 800 trees cut down,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cBut they were not all 100 years old, like some people said. And we\u2019re going to plant 10,000 trees when we\u2019re done.\u201d",
      "General ticket sales for the games are about to start following a pre-registration process that drew in more than 350,000 requests \u2014 70% of them from abroad from more than 210 countries.",
      "Sliding is one of the Games\u2019 most inexpensive attractions with luge events going for as low as 40 euros ($42) and bobsled for a maximum of 100 euros ($104).",
      "But what happens for ticket holders if the sliding track in Cortina isn\u2019t ready and events are moved to Lake Placid?",
      "\u201cIt will be a whole different experience,\u201d said Paul Caine, the president of hospitality package provider On Location, about the prospect of moving from glitzy Cortina to upstate New York.",
      "Caine noted that while \u201cnobody wanted to go to Tahiti\u201d for surfing events in French Polynesia during last year\u2019s Paris Games, hospitality packages were sold for the sailing competitions in Marseille, which is located in southern France \u2014 3 \u00bd hours by train from Paris.",
      "On Location has received requests for hospitality packages from 62 countries so far, with ice hockey, biathlon and figure skating the most popular sports.",
      "Private boxes for the opening ceremony at the iconic San Siro soccer stadium have already sold out.",
      "These are the first Games to fully embrace cost-cutting reforms installed by IOC President Thomas Bach and use mostly existing venues \u2014 which has meant scattering the Games all over northern Italy.",
      "Alpine skiing will be divided between Cortina (for the women\u2019s events) and Bormio (for the men) \u2014 which are separated by a 5 \u00bd-hour drive. Livigno will host freestyle skiing and snowboarding, biathlon will be in Anterselva, Nordic events will be in Val di Fiemme and ice sports in Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very complicated due to the big distances and also because of all the different representatives in each region,\u201d Varnier said. \u201cWe have great relationships with everyone but everybody has their own way and style of doing things, so we need to adapt to them. That\u2019s the spirit of these Games: We adapt to the different territories and not vice versa.\u201d",
      "One reason that the organizing committee is adapting to each and every venue is that most of these places have a long history of hosting World Cup races and world championships.",
      "For example, Bormio hosted the Alpine skiing worlds in 1985 and 2005; Cortina hosted the skiing worlds in 2021 and has been the site of more than 100 World Cup ski races; Anterselva has hosted six biathlon worlds dating back to 1975; Val di Fiemme has hosted three Nordic worlds.",
      "Still, none of that does any good for an athlete like Ester Ledecka, the Czech wonder who claimed golds in both Alpine skiing and snowboarding at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. In 2026, two of Ledecka\u2019s races will be held on the same day in resorts hours apart \u2014 meaning she\u2019ll likely have to choose one over the other.",

      "Ledecka\u2019s variety of training methods could pay off this week when she\u2019ll compete in the super-G and the downhill at the Alpine skiing world championships. She won the super-G at last season\u2019s World Cup finals in Saalbach.",
      "She's also lodging an appeal to the International Olympic Committee to change the dates of one of her competitions at next year's Milan-Cortina Olympics so she can compete in both. The snowboarding parallel giant slalom and the women\u2019s downhill in skiing are scheduled to take place on the same day in different resorts hours apart.",
      "So are there any sports that Ledecka doesn\u2019t excel at?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really terrible at golf and also I don\u2019t really enjoy it because it\u2019s really slow,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m probably really bad in football (soccer), too. \u2026 When I try a new sport, I\u2019m terrible at it usually, but that kind of motivates me and I am trying so hard until I make it and learn something new. But I\u2019m terrible at sports. I mean, it\u2019s weird to say, but I\u2019m terrible. I mean, I\u2019m pretty good in some, like when it\u2019s a gliding sport, like when I can ride on something then it\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Ledecka's father, Janek, is a popular singer in the Czech Republic, and she recently recorded a Christmas song with a friend of her dad's.",
      "\u201cThat was terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cIn music and the arts and everything is so complicated. \u2026 (In sports) it\u2019s quite clear. No matter how you look or what you do, just be fast.\u201d",
      "Still, she might do another song with her brother.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a comic book artist and he (designs) my suits and helmets. And he also has a band. So I was thinking one day we would like to do a song together,\u201d Ledecka said.",
      "But between the snowboarding, skiing and windsurfing, Ledecka\u2019s career as a recording artist is on hold for now.",
      "\u201cMick Jagger is now like 80 or something like that,\u201d Ledecka said of the Rolling Stones lead singer, who is actually 81. \u201cYeah, I have time.\u201d",

But work has been carried out rapidly and the skeleton of the facility now rises 35 meters (115 feet) above street level, serving as a majestic sight to those arriving into the southeastern periphery of Milan.

      "Travis Kelce has no plans to retire anytime soon even if the Kansas City Chiefs win a third straight Super Bowl on Sunday",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Travis Kelce has no plans to retire anytime soon even if the Kansas City Chiefs win a third straight Super Bowl on Sunday.",
      "The future plans for the 35-year-old Kelce have been a lingering question as his fame has risen off the field thanks to his relationship with pop star Taylor Swift and a media career thanks to one of the most popular sports podcasts.",
      "Kelce was asked at opening night festivities Monday night before Kansas City plays Philadelphia in the Super Bowl where he plans to be in three years.",
      "\u201cHopefully still playing football,\u201d he said. \u201cI love doing this, I love coming into work every day. I feel like I still have a lot of good football left in me. We'll see what happens. I know I've been setting myself up for other opportunities in my life. That's always been the goal knowing football only lasts for so long. You have to find a way to get into another career and another profession. I've been doing that in my offseason. But for the most part, I plan on being a Kansas City Chief and playing football.\u201d",
      "Kelce is still playing at a high level even if he has fallen off a bit from his peak. He had 97 catches this season but only gained 823 yards and scored three TDs.",
      "Kelce had a throwback game in the divisional round win over Houston with seven catches for 117 yards and enters the Super Bowl with the most catches ever in the playoffs (174) and second to Hall of Famer Jerry Rice in yards receiving (2,039) and TD catches (20).",
      "Kelce was one of the most popular players with the media during opening night with a large group of reporters and others surrounding his podium for the entire hour, peppering him with questions on all sorts of topics from football to dances to whether he planned to give Swift a ring if the Chiefs win on Sunday. He quickly responded, \u201cA Super Bowl ring? Next question.\u201d",
      "Kelce did say his relationship with Swift helps him on the football field by providing motivation that he needs to work as hard as she does to remain at the top of his game.",
      "\u201cI better hold up my end of the bargain,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she\u2019s out here being the superstar she is, never taking no for an answer, and always working her tail off, I better match that energy for sure.\u201d",

      "Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China under a new partnership with the Shanghai government",
      "TOKYO -- Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday, under a new partnership with the Shanghai government.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. also announced it will start producing batteries for EVs, hybrids and plug-ins at a new $14 billion facility in North Carolina, with shipping starting for North American models in April.",
      "The moves highlight Toyota\u2019s aggressive push in electric cars, a sector where some critics have said it\u2019s fallen behind rivals like Tesla and BYD at a time when the Chinese EV market is booming and the world's concerns about sustainability are increasingly crucial.",
      "Toyota is setting up a company in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai for that effort, with production of the new Lexus EVs starting in 2027.",
      "Initial production capacity there totals 100,000 vehicles a year, which will create about 1,000 jobs, the world\u2019s top automaker said. The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.",
      "Toyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect next week.",
      "\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.",
      "Also Wednesday, Toyota reported fiscal third quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.",
      "Toyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.",
      "Last year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.",
      "Toyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.",
      "The new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.",
      "Toyota said it hopes to contribute to the Chinese government\u2019s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.",
      "\u201cLocal Chinese members will take the lead in planning and developing BEVs that match the unique needs of Chinese customers. Our goal is to become a company that is more loved and supported by the people of China,\u201d said Miyazaki.",

      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn't intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.",
      "But the judge also raised concerns about OpenAI and its relationship with business partner Microsoft and said she wouldn't stop the case from moving to trial as soon as next year so a jury can decide.",
      "\u201cIt is plausible that what Mr. Musk is saying is true. We\u2019ll find out. He\u2019ll sit on the stand,\u201d she said.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "Musk escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff.",
      "Also targeted by Musk's lawsuit is OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft and tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member who also sits on Microsoft's board.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers said she has a high bar for approving the kind of preliminary injunction that Musk wants but hasn't yet ruled on the request.",
      "She has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple's fight with Epic Games, though she said Tuesday that Musk's case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one. Then-President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench in 2011.",
      "Tuesday's hearing was originally set for January but was postponed after Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said his house was destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire.",
      "Musk, who did not attend the hearing, has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI has said Musk\u2019s requested court order would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "He had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI has sought to demonstrate Musk\u2019s early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "Musk is not the only one challenging OpenAI's for-profit transition. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has asked California's attorney general to block it, and the office of Delaware's attorney general has said it is reviewing the conversion.",

      "China has announced a flurry of retaliatory measures against the U.S., including tariffs on imports of products such as coal, liquefied natural gas products and crude oil, as well as an antitrust probe into Google",
      "HONG KONG -- China on Tuesday announced a flurry of retaliatory measures against the U.S., including tariffs on imports of products such as coal, liquefied natural gas products and crude oil, as well as an antitrust probe into Google. It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China.",
      "China and Google have had a long and entangled relationship going back to the early 2000s.",
      "Here's a look at Google's history in China and what the antitrust probe means for the company:",
      "Google launched Chinese-language search engine google.cn in 2006. It was censored to comply with Beijing\u2019s laws, and in 2009, was a major search engine in China with about 36% market share.",
      "In 2010, in response to a cyberattack and an increasing unwillingness to comply with censorship rules, Google said it was no longer willing to block search results and shut down its Chinese search engine, redirecting users to its Hong Kong site instead.",
      "Beijing later blocked Google services under its Great Firewall censorship system, including its email service Gmail, as well as its Chrome browser and search engine, making it inaccessible to users in mainland China.",
      "China typically blocks most Western internet platforms, such as Google, as well as social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Although Google services are not accessible in China, the company still maintains a presence in the country, primarily focused on sales and engineering for its advertising business. It also has employees working on services including Google Cloud and customer solutions.",
      "Google maintains offices in the major Chinese cities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.",
      "China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it was investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",
      "While regulators did not provide further details, the announcement came minutes after the 10% tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect.",
      "As there are few details on what exactly Google is being investigated for, the immediate impact on Google operations is unclear, although its current status is unlikely to be affected by the probe, which could takes months.",
      "Google did not immediately comment on the investigation.",
      "Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics, said that the investigation could be related to Google\u2019s dominance in the Android business, as virtually all smartphone brands apart from Apple and Huawei would have to pay licensing fees to Google to use the Android system on their devices.",
      "\u201cNow, this time, Google is put on the chopping board. But I think it\u2019s still an investigation, right? It hasn\u2019t reached a decision yet,\u201d said Gong, adding, \"I think it\u2019s very much negotiable.\u201d",
      "Huawei developed its own HarmonyOS operating system after it was placed on the U.S. entity list \u2014 foreign individuals, companies and organizations deemed a national security concern \u2014 in 2019, which prevented it from doing business with U.S. firms including Google.",
      "Google has been accused of violating antitrust law in other countries, including those in the European Union, South Korea, Russia, India and Turkey, for allegedly abusing its market dominance.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google's digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn't enough to offset investors' worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.",
      "The October-December results released Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet Inc. showed the company is continuing to reap even more profits from its dominant search engine and other peripheral services.",
      "Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year\u2019s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.",
      "More importantly, revenue growth in the Google Cloud division tethered to the AI craze wasn't as robust as had been anticipated.",
      "That letdown contributed to a more than 8% drop in Alphabet's stock price after the numbers came out. The downturn reversed a recent rally that had elevated Alphabet's shares to a new all-time high earlier Tuesday during the regular trading session.",
      "\u201cThe reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.",
      "But the AI-generated overviews that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.",
      "\u201cThe early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,\u201d said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. \"What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.\u201d",
      "But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t he Chinese startup DeepSeek found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.",
      "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.",
      "\u201cThe company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,\u201d Pichai said.",
      "Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that in its AI principles signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.",
      "The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.",
      "After weighing the evidence presented during a high-profile trial, a federal judge last year declared Google\u2019s search engine is an illegal monopoly \u2014 a decision that has opened the door for regulators to propose forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Court hearings on how Google should be punished for its abuses in the search market are scheduled to begin in April, with a decision anticipated before autumn.",
      "Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered  to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store  for Android smartphone apps. That ruling is currently on hold while Google appeals. Google is also awaiting a ruling in antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- New research shows that when an asteroid slammed into the moon billions of years ago, it carved out a pair of grand canyons on the lunar far side.",
      "That's good news for scientists and NASA, which is looking to land astronauts at the south pole on the near, Earth-facing side untouched by that impact and containing older rocks in original condition.",
      "U.S. and British scientists used photos and data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the area and calculate the path of debris that produced these canyons about 3.8 billion years ago. They reported their findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The incoming space rock passed over the lunar south pole before hitting, creating a huge basin and sending streams of boulders hurtling at a speed of nearly 1 mile a second (1 kilometer a second). The debris landed like missiles, digging out two canyons comparable in size to Arizona's Grand Canyon in barely 10 minutes. The latter, by comparison, took millions of years to form.",
      "\u201cThis was a very violent, a very dramatic geologic process,\u201d said lead author David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.",
      "Kring and his team estimate the asteroid was 15 miles (25 kilometers) across and that the energy needed to create these two canyons would have been more than 130 times that in the world\u2019s current inventory of nuclear weapons.",
      "Most of the ejected debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole, Kring said.",
      "That means NASA\u2019s targeted exploration zone around the pole mostly on the moon's near side won\u2019t be buried under debris, keeping older rocks from 4 billion plus years ago exposed for collection by moonwalkers. These older rocks can help shed light not only on the moon\u2019s origins, but also Earth\u2019s.",
      "Kring said it\u2019s unclear whether these two canyons are permanently shadowed like some of the craters at the moon\u2019s south pole. \u201cThat is something that we\u2019re clearly going to be reexamining,\u201d he said.",
      "Permanently shadowed areas at the bottom of the moon are thought to hold considerable ice, which could be turned into rocket fuel and drinking water by future moonwalkers.",

      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",

      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",
      "Scientists then used AI to piece together the images, search for ink that reveals where there is writing, and enhance the clarity of the text. The process led to a 3D image of the scroll that allowed experts to unroll it virtually, using a process called segmentation.",
      "AI, as it stands, has its limits. Little of the text has been deciphered so far. One of the few words that has been made out is the ancient Greek for \u201cdisgust.\u201d",
      "Scholars are being encouraged to join in the effort to complete the text.",
      "\u201cWe are still at the beginning of a long process,\u201d Peter Toth, the Cornelia Starks Curator of Greek Collections at the Bodleian, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe need better images, and they are very positive and very, very confident that they can still improve the image quality and the legibility of the text.\u201d",
      "Toth also laid out his hope that the technology can be made available locally so that the other two fragile scrolls won't have to be transported to Diamond\u2019s headquarters.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 08:00:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
    "story": [
      "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius) and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 degrees Celsius) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51.1 degrees Celsius) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \u201cBut we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres (1,779 hectares) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Samoa\u2019s top health official on Monday denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made during his bid to become U.S. health secretary, rejecting his claim that some who died in the country's 2019 measles epidemic didn't have the disease.",
      "\"We don\u2019t know what was killing them,\" Kennedy said during tense U.S. Senate hearings last week on whether he should oversee the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggesting that the cause of the 83 deaths \u2014 mostly of children under age 5 \u2014 was unclear.",
      "\"It's a total fabrication,\u201d Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told The Associated Press of Kennedy's comments.",
      "U.S. senators grilled Kennedy last week over his 2019 Samoa trip, accusing him of downplaying his role in the epidemic.",
      "The outbreak devastated the Pacific island nation in 2019, killing 83 people in a population of 200,000. Vaccination rates were historically low because of poor public health management and the 2018 deaths of two babies whose vaccines were incorrectly prepared, prompting fears that the MMR immunization was unsafe before the nature of the error was discovered.",
      "The government suspended vaccinations for 10 months before the outbreak \u2014 the period when Kennedy visited. His trip was organized by a Samoan anti-vaccine influencer, according to a 2021 blog post by Kennedy.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy denied that his visit had fueled anti-vaccine sentiment. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaxxers from New Zealand came to be with him here,\u201d Ekeroma said. \u201cThat's how I know that his influence can be far-reaching.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the tissue samples were sent to New Zealand, most of those people did not have measles,\u201d Kennedy told U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Ekeroma, a medical doctor who also holds a doctorate in health, said that the claim was a \u201chuge denial\u201d of the fact that doctors from several countries traveled to Samoa to treat measles patients.",
      "The Samoan official wasn't the health chief during the outbreak, but confirmed key details with his predecessor, he said. Only one autopsy was carried out and no postmortem tissue samples were sent abroad, which was not unusual because measles is a simple disease to diagnose, said Ekeroma.",
      "Blood samples from living patients were sent to Australia and New Zealand, where the public health agency said Monday that testing had confirmed the same strain of measles circulating in New Zealand at the time.",
      "\u201cI went there \u2013 nothing to do with vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa and make health delivery much more efficient.\u201d",
      "Ekeroma rejected that assertion, referring to social media posts by anti-vaccine advocates who posed for photos with Kennedy during his trip. One later wrote on the blog of Kennedy's then nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 which has decried MMR vaccines as unsafe \u2014 that during the outbreak he received advice from people assembled by Kennedy encouraging the alternative treatments he was supplying to Samoan families.",
      "In the same blog post, Kennedy recalled meeting Samoa's then prime minister, who he said was \u201ccurious to measure health outcomes following the \u2018natural experiment\u2019 created by the national respite from vaccines.\u201d",
      "In late 2019, Kennedy wrote to the leader, saying that the deaths could have been caused by a measles vaccine \u2014 statements he repeated in written responses to senators' questions following the hearing. He urged the Samoan leader to approach a particular laboratory to investigate the source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMy words had nothing to do with vaccine uptake in Samoa or with the 2019 epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in his written responses.",
      "But Kennedy emboldened anti-vaccine contacts in Samoa, Ekeroma said, and the epidemic was fueled by disinformation in social media posts in the island nation and abroad.",
      "Moelagi Leilani Jackson, a Samoan nurse who worked on the vaccination campaign, told the AP in 2023 that anti-vaccine campaigners \u201cgot louder\u201d after Kennedy\u2019s visit.",
      "\u201cI feel like they felt they had the support of Kennedy,\u201d she said.",
      "However, Ekeroma said that Kennedy's overtures weren't heeded by the nation\u2019s leaders. A vaccination campaign resumed in 2019 and measles vaccines are now compulsory for Samoan children.",
      "If Kennedy is affirmed as the top U.S. health official this week, it would be \u201ca danger to us, a danger to everyone,\u201d Ekeroma said. Kennedy would control U.S. funding for vaccination initiatives and could make affordable vaccines harder for small nations like Samoa to access, the official said.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be appointed, then we will have to actually discuss around the Pacific as to how we\u2019re going to try to neutralize his influence in the region,\u201d he added.",

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",
      "But the new study adds a more \"specific and local picture to how lead levels changed,\u201d said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research.",

      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he might continue and harden Biden\u2019s approach.",
      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",
      "Trump said it was a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",
      "Countries such as Singapore, they added, should be subject to strict licensing requirements if they aren't willing to \u201ccrack down\u201d on China using their country as an intermediary for shipments.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nvidia said that its revenue associated with Singapore \"does not indicate diversion to China.\"",
      "\u201cOur public filings report \u2018bill to\u2019 not \u2018ship to\u2019 locations of our customers,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said. \u201cMany of our customers have business entities in Singapore and use those entities for products destined for the U.S. and the west. We insist that our partners comply with all applicable laws, and if we receive any information to the contrary, act accordingly.\u201d"

    "summary": "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That\u2019s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants.",
      "However, the growth in energy demand comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels and the closure of aging nuclear power plants.",
      "In recent months, governors including Shapiro and state ratepayer advocates have pressured the operator of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid to reduce the amount of money it offers to power plant owners, warning that it will unjustifiably raise electricity bills across the region.",
      "__",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the hydrogen tax credit is for businesses that use it, not make it.",

      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

      "The judge is heard arguments from lawyers for five pregnant undocumented women.",
      "A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship.",
      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman heard arguments Wednesday over a request by five pregnant undocumented women to issue a preliminary injunction blocking Trump's Day-1 executive order on birthright citizenship.",
      "The women and the two nonprofits filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the executive order -- which challenged the long-settled interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause -- violated the constitution and multiple federal laws.",
      "\"If allowed to go into effect, the Executive Order would throw into doubt the citizenship status of thousands of children across the country, including the children of Individual Plaintiffs and Members,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Lawyers for the Department of Justice have claimed that Trump's executive order attempts to resolve \"prior misimpressions\" of the 14th Amendment, arguing that birthright citizenship creates a \"perverse incentive for illegal immigration.\" If permitted, Trump's executive order would preclude U.S. citizenship from the children of undocumented immigrants or immigrants whose presence in the United States is lawful but temporary.",
      "\"Text, history, and precedent support what common sense compels: the Constitution does not harbor a windfall clause granting American citizenship to, inter alia: the children of those who have circumvented (or outright defied) federal immigration laws,\" DOJ lawyers argued.",
      "The executive order has already been put on hold by a federal judge in Seattle, who last month criticized the Department of Justice for attempting to defend what he called a \"blatantly unconstitutional\" order.",
      "\"I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar can state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It boggles my mind,\" said U.S. District Judge John Coughenour. \"Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?\"",
      "Because Judge Coughenour's order only blocked the executive order temporarily, Judge Boardman will consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction of the executive order.",
      "\"The hearing that's coming up is a proceeding that essentially puts a longer pause,\" explained Loyola Marymount University professor Justin Levitt. \"It's an order saying, 'Don't implement this,' because the plaintiffs have shown a likelihood that they'll succeed when we finally get to a final resolution, but many substantive legal claims are effectively decided on preliminary injunctions.\"",
      "With Trump vowing to appeal a ruling that finds his executive order unconstitutional, a preliminary injunction -- if granted after Wednesday's hearing -- could be his first opportunity to appeal to a higher court.",
      "Members of the Trump administration spent months crafting this executive order with the understanding that it would inevitably be challenged and potentially blocked by lower courts, according to sources familiar with their planning.",
      "While the lawsuit challenging the executive order in Seattle was brought by four state attorneys general, the five pregnant undocumented women who filed the Maryland case argue that they would be uniquely harmed by the order. With individual states and undocumented women suffering different harms under the order, the cases could present different reasons to justify blocking the order.",
      "Monica -- a medical doctor from Venezuela with temporary protected status who joined the lawsuit under a pseudonym -- said she joined the suit because she fears her future child will become stateless, with her home country facing an ongoing humanitarian, political and economic crisis.",
      "\"I'm 12 weeks pregnant. I should be worried about the health of my child. I should be thinking about that primarily, and instead my husband and I are stressed, we're anxious and we're depressed about the reality that my child may not be able to become a U.S. citizen,\" she said.",

      "The tariffs, which took effect on Tuesday, slap a 10% tax on all imported goods from China, the third-largest U.S. trade partner.",
      "The Trump administration had also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but the U.S. reached an agreement with each of those countries on Monday, pausing the tariffs for one month.",
      "Still, trade experts said they expect the China tariffs to increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers. The tariffs could hike prices for an array of goods, from curtains to saucepans to winter coats.",
      "\"If you could light up everything around you that has been touched by Chinese manufacturing or inputs, your whole room would light up,\" Christine McDaniel, a former senior trade economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, told ABC News.",
      "The exact price impact remains unclear, however, since businesses within the supply chain could opt to take on some or all of the tax burden, some experts added.",
      "The Trump administration did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "In a series of social media posts over recent days, Trump said the tariffs target Canada, Mexico and China for hosting the manufacture and transport of illicit drugs that end up in the United States. In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump urged the three countries to address his concerns, while acknowledging the tariffs may cause some financial hardship within the U.S.",
      "\"WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,\" Trump wrote.",

      "Personal electronic devices make up a top category of products imported from China, meaning price increases could impact tablets, smartphones and laptops, experts said. Video cameras, headphones and video game consoles would also be impacted.",
      "The U.S. imported $31.6 billion worth of electronic computers from China over the first nine months of last year, U.S. Census Bureau data showed. Those products accounted for 30% of the total value of U.S. computer imports over that period, the data indicated.",
      "\"The consumer electronic sector is heavily integrated across Asia -- China being a huge center of that,\" McDaniel said. \"That would presumably be at the top of the list.\"",
      "Tennis shoes and sandals",

      "The U.S. imports between 96% and 99% of all footwear sold nationwide, the United States International Trade Commission, or USITC, found in 2020.",
      "China accounts for about $4 of every $10 in imported footwear sold to U.S. buyers, according to the USITC.",
      "Footwear could suffer significant price hikes since the Chinese firms manufacturing the products often face narrow profit margins, lending them little latitude to take on some of the tax burden, Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who studies trade policy, told ABC News.",
      "If sellers were to pass along the full burden of the tariffs to U.S. consumers, it would amount to a 10% price increase. Lovely said the price hike for footwear could approach that upper limit.",
      "\"For items like this, I\u2019d expect the price increases would be closer to 10% than 1%,\" Lovely said.",
      "Toys and games",

      "Shares of toy companies fell on Monday in anticipation of the China tariffs. Mattel's stock price fell about 4.5% while Hasbro's dropped 2%. Each of the companies recovered much of the losses on Tuesday. They both source a lower share of their products from China than the industry average, MarketWatch reported.",

      "The GOP senator spent a career pushing vaccines while Kennedy questioned them.",
      "On Monday night, just hours ahead of a Senate committee vote Tuesday on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as health secretary, Sen. Bill Cassidy was still deciding what to do.",
      "Cassidy, who worked 30 years in public hospitals in Louisiana, is a lifelong advocate of vaccinations. After watching a young woman almost die of liver failure after contracting hepatitis B, the doctor helped to create a program offering free shots to school children.",
      "Kennedy, on the other hand, had built a large following on social media by questioning the safety of vaccines and falsely linking them to autism, despite numerous large studies debunking the myth.",
      "Now, Cassidy was the sole GOP senator on the Senate Finance Committee openly questioning whether Kennedy was the right man for the job. A single \"no\" vote by any Republican on the panel could have been enough to derail the nomination by President Donald Trump, who said he picked Kennedy to \"go wild\" on issues related to food, medicine and health.",
      "Cassidy said he was asking: \"Would it be possible to have Mr. Kennedy collaborate in helping public health agencies re-earn the trust of the American people?\"",
      "The Louisiana Republican said he received \"hundreds\" of personal messages a day and \"thousands\" more through his Senate office. Worried pediatricians urged Cassidy to block Kennedy from the job, blaming Kennedy for a rise in vaccine hesitancy among parents. There were pro-Kennedy social media influencers too, including \"MAHA moms\" \u2013 a reference to Kennedy's call to \"Make America Healthy Again\" -- demanding that he be given a chance to shake up what they saw as a broken system.",
      "\"It was a massive coalition that worked together to bring together several different groups that were literally shutting down the phone lines over the weekend and late last week and yesterday,\" Vani Hari, a food influencer nicknamed the \"Food Babe\" on social media, told ABC News.",
      "\"The messaging was very positive,\" she said.",
      "According to one person familiar with Cassidy's thinking, the senator was 95%\" of the way to a \"yes\" vote on Monday night, but that the issue of vaccines stood in the way.",
      "In particular, Cassidy was worried about a potential measles outbreak if Kennedy were to assume control of America's health agencies and continue to raise doubt about the vaccine, which had been used for decades to prevent the highly contagious and potentially deadly childhood disease.",
      "\"He needed something to just let him feel comfortable enough that he wouldn't be responsible for the death of children because of this,\" the person told ABC News of Cassidy's concerns.",
      "A lifelong Republican, Cassidy had already defied President Donald Trump once by voting in 2021 in favor of a single article of impeachment of Trump in connection to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and faces a Republican primary challenger for his Senate seat next year.",
      "By Tuesday, Cassidy appeared to have gotten what he needed to vote \"yes.\" After speaking several times with Kennedy by phone throughout the weekend and again the morning of the vote, Cassidy announced on the social media platform X that he had \"serious commitments\" from both Kennedy and the White House.",
      "Among those promises is that Kennedy will give advanced notice to Congress if he imposes any changes to vaccine safety monitoring and will meet with Cassidy several times a month to build a working relationship.",
      "Both the administration and Kennedy had sought \"to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination\" and offering an \"unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship,\" Cassidy said.",

      "\"It's been a long, intense process, but I assessed it as I would assess a patient as a physician. Ultimately, restoring trust in our public health institution is too important, and I think Mr. Kennedy can help get that done,\" Cassidy said.",

And while Cassidy might believe he can keep Kennedy in check, there's not much motivation for the new administration to keep promises to individual lawmakers.",
      "\"It's a totally different kind of Washington,\" said Sarah Isgur, a Republican who served in the first Trump administration and is now an ABC News contributor.",
      "Whereas in the past, lawmakers and members of the executive branch worked closely together to build the kinds of relationships that might extend long after they leave public service, the current administration says its focus is forcing through big changes, not making friends or future job connections.",
      "\"Cassidy is doing something very rational, which was done in past administrations,\" said Isgur. \"But it's based on a previous version of Washington \u2026 This administration has made clear they are not running the government on relationships.\"",
      "In another time, Kennedy's nomination would have been unthinkable. A Democrat whose cousin Caroline Kennedy told senators was a \"predator\" who sought only attention and fame, Kennedy is known for promoting debunked conspiracy theories on health. In recent years, he chaired the Children's Health Defense, a group that advocates against the recommended schedule for children's vaccines. He also played a central role in preparing a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine. He has since promised to divest potential proceeds in the case, which is ongoing, to his adult son.",
      "Kennedy counters that he believes the pharmaceutical industry is too focused on profits and that medical experts aren't doing enough to question commonly held assertions while Americans suffer from chronic diseases.",
      "\"News reports have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine or any industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety,\" Kennedy told lawmakers last week.",
      "Brad Woodhouse, director of the liberal advocacy group Protect Our Care, said the fight wasn't over until the full Senate votes.",
      "\"Every Senator will now have to weigh in, and we aren't giving up on any vote,\" he said in a statement released shortly after the vote.",
      "Republicans have a 53-seat majority, allowing Kennedy to lose three Republicans and still survive with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie breaking vote if necessary.",
      "GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are widely seen as potential \"no\" votes because of their willingness to challenge the administration on other issues. McConnell, a polio survivor, has spoken previously about the value of a health secretary who supports medical consensus on vaccines.",
      "Another potential swing vote -- Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina \u2013 already announced he would back Kennedy after receiving assurances that Kennedy wouldn't intercept the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Institutes of Health",
      "The Trump administration has already paused major functions at CDC, including blocking the release of the agency's weekly publication -- the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report -- as part of a pause on all public communications to ensure everything released is in line with Trump's agenda.",
      "\"I for one, think that it is time to put a disruptor in. It is time to put somebody in there that's going to go wild,\" Tillis said.",
      "Democrats said they too want someone to challenge the status quo on chronic disease, but said Kennedy's denial of scientific consensus wouldn't help Americans.",
      "\"I want a disruptor in the healthcare system and one leading it. I don't want a destroyer,\" said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.",

    "story": [
      "The executive order restricts gender-affirming care for trans people under 19.",
      "Transgender young adults and families with transgender youth filed a legal challenge Tuesday against an executive order from the Trump administration that restricts gender-affirming care for transgender people under 19.",
      "\u201cWhen the Tennessee Legislature passed a law that banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, I knew we had to leave the state so that my daughter could continue receiving the care she needs,\u201d said Kristen Chapman, the mother of 17-year-old plaintiff Willow, in a statement.",
      "The Virginia resident continued: \"We moved to Virginia in the summer of 2023, but struggled to find a provider that would accept our Medicaid insurance. As paying for her care out-of-pocket became prohibitively expensive, I tried for months to get an appointment at VCU, and I finally got an appointment for January 29, 2025. The day before our appointment, President Trump signed the executive order at issue in this case. The next day, just a few hours before our appointment, VCU told us they would not be able to provide Willow with care. I thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter. Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "Trump's order moves to withhold federal funding to medical institutions that provide such care -- including puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and surgeries -- calling on the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \"take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" The executive order does not appear to restrict these procedures for non-transgender people under 19.",
      "Trump's executive order states that \"it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"",
      "The lawsuit, PFLAG v. Trump, was filed by Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Maryland, and the law firms Hogan Lovells and Jenner & Block on behalf of on behalf of PFLAG National, GLMA, two transgender young adults and five transgender adolescents.",
      "Major national medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and more than 20 others argue that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, beneficial, and medically necessary.",
      "The complaint notes that \"for many transgender adolescents, the onset of puberty leading to physical changes in their bodies that are incongruent with their gender identities can cause extreme distress.\"",
      "It continued, \"Puberty-delaying medication allows transgender adolescents to pause these changes, thereby minimizing and potentially preventing the heightened gender dysphoria caused by the development of secondary sex characteristics incongruent with their gender identity.\"",
      "The executive order is the latest action from Trump that impacts the transgender community -- which is estimated to make up less than 1% of the population over the age of 13. Trump also recently signed executive orders restricting transgender participation in the military, ending federal legal recognition of transgender people, and restricting gender marker changes on federal documents.",
      "The Supreme Court is currently considering the landmark U.S. v. Skrmetti case, which challenges Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming puberty blockers and hormone therapy on the grounds that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by discriminating based on sex.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's executive order calls on institutions of higher education are called on to \"monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff.\"",
    "story": [
      "The executive order about deporting students has legal experts concerned.",
      "President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at combatting antisemitism calls on institutions of higher education to \"monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff\" concerning \"antisemitism\" on college campuses.",
      "Some legal scholars say they're concerned about what this could mean for free speech on college campuses following more than a year of tension between students, faculty and administrators, while other experts noted that past McCarthy-era cases on communist activity could foreshadow the action's legal standing.",
      "The main thrust of the executive order's purpose: \"Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault,\" the order reads.",
      "The fact sheet released by the White House on the new executive action threatens to \"deport\" college students in the United States on student visas and other \u201cresident aliens\u201d who expressed \"pro-Hamas\" or \"pro-jihadist\" views to \"combat antisemitism on college campuses and in communities across the nation.\" It calls for immediate action to be taken by the Department of Justice to \"quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\"",
      "\"It provides like a signaling mechanism and an alibi for university administrators who ... want to crack down on Palestinian activism, and now they can point to this executive order and use the government as a further pretext for their actions, even though they're under no legal obligation to do what the executive order says,\" said Darryl Li, a legal scholar at the University of Chicago, in an interview with ABC News.",
      "He added that in his legal opinion, \"They're not under a legal obligation to spy on their students and to report their students to the government. They need not, and they should not, cooperate with this executive order.\"",
      "However, past Supreme Court cases -- particularly during the McCarthy era and the Cold War -- found it is within Congress' power to deport a legal noncitizen resident for their views, advocacy or membership in a political group if it's in the interest of national security, Nadine Strossen, a Senior Fellow with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), told ABC News.",
      "These limitations also impact noncitizens attempting to enter the country, Strossen noted.",
      "\"There was this distinction; it's one thing to say, government may not prosecute you, you may not be subject to civil penalties, but you may still be subject to deportation because of this doctrine that Congress has what's called plenary power, pretty much unchecked power, with respect to matters concerning who is able to be present in this country and not present in this country,\" said Strossen.",
      "On Oct. 7, 2023, the Palestinian terror group Hamas attacked Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people, and around 250 others were taken hostage, according to the Israeli government.",
      "Israel then began its monthslong retaliation on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "The United States and the United Nations have not officially declared Israeli action to be a genocide. However, a UN Special Committee report found that Israel\u2019s warfare methods in Gaza were consistent with genocidal tactics.",
      "Protests and around-the-clock encampments concerning the war erupted at colleges and universities around the country.",
      "Pro-Palestinian protesters called for an end to what they called an Israeli \"genocide\" against Palestinians and criticized the Israeli \"occupation\" of Palestinian territories. Pro-Israel protesters called for a return of the hostages or were in support of the Israeli effort against Hamas.",
      "Colleges were thrust into the spotlight as they reckoned with charges of antisemitism and Islamophobia, and anti-Israeli, anti-Arab or anti-Palestinian sentiment amid the campus clashes.",
      "Title VI, a law that bans discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in any institution or program that receives federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education, became the center of dozens of investigations across the country.",
      "Students and professors, many of whom were advocating for a ceasefire or pushing for an end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, were subsequently arrested at universities and protests across the country. Some were suspended or expelled from their universities, others were arrested for trespassing or disturbing the peace, though many charges were later dropped.",
      "Student protesters critical of the Israeli government's military actions in Gaza continue to face accusations of antisemitism. But many of the student groups behind the protests \u2013 including Jewish activists \u2013 have said that individuals making inflammatory remarks do not represent their groups or their values concerning the war in Gaza.",
      "Other Jewish or pro-Israel students around the country have spoken out about the pressures they too have faced, including renewed concerns about safety and acts of hate as law enforcement noted a spike in antisemitic incidents.",
      "Trump's executive order calls on higher education institutions to familiarize themselves with 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) -- which defines \"inadmissible\" non-citizens for their relationship to alleged \"terrorist activities.\"",
      "FIRE released a statement against Trump's executive order, arguing that college campuses are intended to be places of learning and debate over a wide range of issues: \"Advocates of ideological deportation today should not be surprised to see it used against ideas they support in the future.\"",
      "\"This openness, albeit unpleasant or controversial at times, is a defining strength of American higher education,\" an online statement read. \"It\u2019s one of the features attractive to students traveling from abroad who may hope to take part in the speech protections Americans have worked so hard to preserve. These are protections that they may very well be denied in their home countries.\"",
      "International students, or staff members with visas, are in a vulnerable situation because of their status, legal experts say.",
      "\"The potential loss of the visa is something that, of course, is devastating to international students. And if your visa is revoked on sort of security or terrorism grounds, it's kind of like a lifelong -- you're basically banned from the United States for life, even if you have family who are U.S. citizens who live in the United States,\" said Radhika Sainath, a senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal, who has advised hundreds of free speech or censorship cases concerning pro-Palestinian supporters.",
      "Legal experts argue the order's vague language is strategic to smear pro-Palestinian support -- though the order doesn't explicitly state concerns over support for \"Palestinians\" -- which has long been painted as inherently antisemitic or terroristic.",
      "\"This is McCarthyist. It's authoritarian,\" said Sainath. \"Students are really feeling the breadth already. Before Trump came in -- from their own universities -- students have been evicted from student housing and been homeless for minor, minor rule violations. They've been suspended, they've been expelled, they've lost scholarships, they've lost financial aid. The harm is really, really great, and many of these students are first-generation students. They are low-income students, and it can be quite harmful to be punished again for speaking out against a genocide.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"The whole 'drill, baby, drill' thing is highly overblown,\" one expert said.",
      "While President Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to lower fuel prices for U.S. consumers with an edict of \"drill, baby, drill,\" energy experts predicted his pending tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China will lead to Americans paying more at the gas pump.",
      "Trump has signed an executive order slapping a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, with a 10% charge on natural gas and oil. Under it, Mexico will also be hit with a 25% tax on imports, including oil. And China faces a 10% tariff on all imports.",
      "As a result of Trump's actions, Canada has threatened to reciprocate with a 25% tariff on U.S. imports and Mexico has vowed to hit the U.S. with tariffs, which could further jack up prices for U.S. consumers.",
      "Chinese officials also struck back Tuesday, announcing a 15% tariff on select American goods, including coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, pickup trucks and other products.",
      "\"China firmly opposes the U.S. practice and urges the United States to correct its wrong practices immediately,\" the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.",
      "Canada sends US 4.5 million barrels of petroleum a day",
      "The tit-for-tat over tariffs could soon be felt by U.S. consumers, Wall Street analyst Stewart Glickman, deputy director of the global financial research firm CFRA, told ABC News.",
      "\"Higher prices at the pump are, unfortunately, a good way to stoke inflation,\" Glickman said.",
      "Both Canada and Mexico are among the Top 5 sources of the country's total petroleum imports, including crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Canada is the source of 52% of U.S. gross total petroleum, including 60% of its gross crude oil imports, according to EIA.",
      "Meanwhile, Mexico accounts for about 10% of petroleum and crude oil imported by the United States, according to EIA.",
      "Trump announced Monday that he is pausing the tariffs for a month after speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "In his executive order, Trump said he was imposing the tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China to hold those countries \"accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.\" He said the tariffs will remain in place until Mexico, Canada and China honor their promises.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump urged the three countries to address his concerns, while acknowledging the tariffs may cause some financial hardship to U.S. consumers.",
      "\"WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Glickman said Canada exports 4.5 million barrels of petroleum a day to the United States and Mexico exports to the U.S. up to 500,000 barrels a day.",
      "\"Canada is a bigger deal because of the huge volumes the U.S. imports from Canada,\" said Glickman, who focuses on the energy sector.",
      "Gas prices expected to jump",
      "Under the tariffs, Glickman predicted U.S. consumers will quickly see prices at gas pumps going up an estimated 9 cents per gallon.",
      "Glickman said U.S. consumers could begin feeling the pinch at the pumps a few weeks after the tariffs go into effect, \"after refiners go through more of their stockpiled imports.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, the average price for a gallon of regular gas ranged from $2.63 in Mississippi to $4.50 in California and Hawaii, according to GasBuddy, a website that tracks fuel prices nationwide.",
      "\"The national average has seen little meaningful change over the past week, as oil markets continue to face selling pressure,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, wrote in a blog post on the company's website on Monday. \"However, with President Trump imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, some motorists may see gas prices inch up in certain regions.\"",
      "De Haan estimated that gas prices could increase 5 to 20 cents per gallon. He said markets that rely heavily on Canadian crude oil or refined product imports from Canada such as the Great Lakes, Midwest, the Rockies and the Northeast will feel the pain at the pump the most.",
      "\"Trump's new trade tax has already triggered retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, escalating tensions,\" De Haan wrote. \"While, on paper, tariffs on Canadian energy could have a significant impact on fuel prices, prolonged trade tax increases could weaken global economies, reducing demand and partially offsetting the effects of tariffs.\"",
      "When Trump ran for a second term in the White House, he made lowering fuel prices the cornerstone of his economic recovery plan after inflation surged to its highest level in 40 years under the Biden administration.",
      "\"I make this pledge to the great people of America: I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy,\" Trump announced to the crowd at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as he accepted his nomination at the Republican National Convention in July.",
      "\"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump said, garnering resounding cheers and applause from the RNC audience.",
      "But Glickman said Trump's oil and gas slogan \"is highly overblown.\"",
      "\"It's not like U.S. producers were champing at the bit to produce more and were being stymied by a virtue-signaling Biden administration,\" Glickman said.",
      "Glickman said the United States remains the leader in crude oil production, producing 13.2 million barrels a day in 2024. He said EIA is forecasting that the United States will produce 13.5 million barrels a day in 2025.",
      "\"U.S. producers are quite happy to generate modest production growth and also plow a lot of cash flow into dividends and buybacks,\" Glickman said. \"So, (1) 'drill baby drill' is not really a realistic thing, and (2) tariffs are more likely to push prices higher, not lower.\"",

      "President Donald Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs, an atmospheric scientist, to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "If confirmed, this will be Jacobs' second stint leading the agency. Beginning in 2019, he served as its acting administrator until Trump left office at the end of his term in January 2021.",
      "Jacobs is remembered for the so-called \"Sharpiegate\" incident, a September 2019 controversy during which Trump, in an Oval Office press briefing, showed a map of Hurricane Dorian's forecast track that appeared to have been altered with a black pen to show the storm's track extended to include southern Alabama. Though the official storm track from the National Weather Service (NWS) did not have it hitting the state, Trump had inaccurately declared a few days earlier that it would.",
      "Shortly after Trump made the claim, NOAA issued a statement siding with Trump and admonishing the NWS for publicly saying that Alabama was not in danger from the storm.",
      "Dorian ultimately did not make landfall in the U.S. and stayed east of Florida.",
      "The NOAA Science Council subsequently investigated Jacobs, saying that he violated the organization's scientific integrity policy by issuing a statement supporting Trump's incorrect claim about Dorian's storm track as an official NOAA release.",
      "Jacobs is currently the chief science advisor for the community Unified Forecast System (UFS), part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's (UCAR) Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science at North Carolina State University.",
      "The UFS is an effort by the broad scientific community to develop a common, open-source modeling infrastructure that encourages collaboration and eases the transition from research to operations to improve NOAA's forecast models.",
      "Jacobs has long supported an open innovation approach and well-coordinated research efforts that are mutually beneficial to the public, private, and academic sectors. In 2021, he published an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, discussing his vision for the community UFS.",
      "Before serving as NOAA's acting director, Jacobs was the chief atmospheric scientist at Panasonic Avionics Corporation, where he directed the research and development of its aviation weather observing platforms and modeling programs.",
      "In a November 2024 podcast interview, Jacobs shared his views on the future of government agencies, like NOAA, and also weighed in on Project 2025, a playbook of controversial conservative policy proposals co-authored by many Trump allies and members of his first administration, organized by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and which includes recommendations to repeal and eliminate preventive climate change initiatives.",
      "\"Any time there's an administration or an election year, whether it's an incumbent or a new administration, you're always going to have these think tanks and groups pushing transition documents to the transition team saying, this is what you should do, you should read this,\" Jacobs said. \"The executive branch can't just come in and completely change something that's authorized in law.\"",
      "Jacobs also said that \"NOAA has all of these congressional mandates that are codified. Congress would have to rewrite a mountain of legislation to undo all that.\u201d",
      "Last month, Jacobs was recognized as a 2025 Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) during the organization's annual meeting. An AMS Fellow is a distinction reserved for those who have made \"outstanding contributions to the atmospheric or related oceanic or hydrologic sciences or their applications during a substantial period of years.\"",

      "The DOJ, under new leaders, wants information about agents who worked that case.",
      "A group of FBI agents who assisted in criminal investigations stemming from the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol filed suit Tuesday in an effort to block the Justice Department from assembling lists of agents for potential disciplinary actions or firings.",
      "The class-action lawsuit, filed anonymously by the agents Tuesday afternoon in D.C. federal court, includes screenshots showing a survey that was sent this week about their actions related to the Jan. 6 cases.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are employees of the FBI who worked on Jan. 6 and/or Mar-a-Lago cases, and who have been informed that they are likely to be terminated in the very near future (the week of February 3-9, 2025) for such activity,\" the lawsuit said. \"They intend to represent a class of at least 6,000 current and former FBI agents and employees who participated in some manner in the investigation and prosecution of crimes and abuses of power by Donald Trump, or by those acting at his behest.\"",
      "The suit specifically seeks to enjoin the DOJ from \"aggregation, storage, reporting, publication or dissemination of any list or compilation of information that would identify FBI agents and other personnel, and tie them directly to Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago case activities,\" referring to the Capitol attack and the probe into President Trump's retention of classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021.",
      "The top organization that represents FBI agents and employees also filed suit Tuesday against the Justice Department over what they allege is the \"unlawful retaliation\" against agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases.",

      "\"Plaintiffs seek this Court's protection from Defendants' anticipated retaliatory decision to expose their personal information for opprobrium and potential vigilante action by those who they were investigating,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "The lawsuit cites multiple instances of Jan. 6 rioters pardoned by Trump who, in the wake of their release from prison, have targeted specific FBI agents who previously investigated them.",
      "\"The DOJ's plan to release the names of FBI agents who investigated January 6th is an appalling attack on non-partisan public servants who have dedicated their lives to protecting our communities and our nation,\" Chris Mattei, an attorney for the FBI agents, said in a statement. \"It is clear that the threatened disclosure is a prelude to an unlawful purge of the FBI solely driven by the Trump Administration's vengeful and political motivations.\"",
      "The Justice Department, under leadership appointed by the Trump administration, has asked for information about potentially thousands of FBI employees across the country who were involved in work related to investigations stemming from the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "According an email sent to the FBI workforce on Friday, and obtained by ABC News, the requested information was to be provided by Tuesday afternoon to the office of the acting Deputy Attorney General, Emil Bove, whose office will then conduct a review to determine if any \"personnel actions\" are warranted.",

      "Congressional leaders rallied their troops outside the Treasury Department.",
      "Democratic lawmakers continue to protest tech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s sweeping influence over government decisions and material, with protests, proposed legislation and other attempts to obstruct President Donald Trump's agenda and the efforts of his close ally to cut what the Trump administration considers wasteful spending.",
      "Dozens of lawmakers appeared Tuesday at a \u201cNobody Elected Elon\u201d rally outside the Treasury Department, each delivering fiery attacks directed toward Trump and Musk. They described Musk\u2019s action as a \u201cheist,\u201d a \u201ctakeover\u201d and an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d",
      "Rep. Ayanna Pressley went as far as calling Musk a \u201cNazi nepo baby.\u201d",
      "Democrats have pushed back against Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s efforts, mounting growing protests, introducing legislation and threatening to try to derail his agenda by holding up confirmation of his appointees.",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters said, \u201cWe have got to tell Elon Musk, \u2018Nobody elected your ass. Nobody told you you could get all of our private information. Nobody told you you could be in charge of the payments of this country.'\u201d",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren added, \u201cNot one Democrat in America voted for Elon Musk, not one not one Republican in America voted for Elon Musk, not one independent in America voted for Elon Musk, not one libertarian in America voted for Elon Musk, dammit, not one vegetarian in America voted for Elon Musk, and yet, Elon Musk is seizing the power that belongs to the American people.\u201d",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal cautioned his Republican colleagues that Musk\u2019s actions could have harmful consequences for their constituents as well.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy struck a similar tone as his Democratic colleagues, threatening to stall Trump\u2019s nominees from being confirmed should Musk continue his overreach.",
      "\u201cYou will remember this is the moment that made a difference for America, because the message here is, we have to reach beyond this crowd, reach beyond this city. Reach beyond Democrats, to Republicans and say you're losing your country too,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Pressley reached out to Republicans, too.",
      "\"I want to say to our Republican colleagues, pay attention. We're here today in the hopes that you will see the light. But if you do not see the light, we will bring the fire. Resist,\u201d she said Rep. Pressley.",
      "During multiple times, there were chants of \u201cLock him up!\u201d from the crowd, which appeared to be directed at Trump and Musk.",
      "Murphy also made a dig at the young staffers reportedly working for DOGE.",
      "\u201cWhen we open up the Senate every single morning, we don\u2019t pledge allegiance to the billionaires. We don't. We don't pledge allegiance to Elon Musk. We don't pledge allegiance to the creepy 22 year olds working for Elon Musk. We pledge allegiance to the United States of America,\u201d he said to cheers.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said they\u2019re pushing joint legislation that would block \u2018unlawful meddling\u2019 in the Treasury Department\u2019s payment systems -- responding to news on Monday that Treasury gave Musk and representatives of DOGE access to its vast federal payment system.",
      "At a news conference at the Capitol, the Democratic leaders unveiled the bill as the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d Act, a play off of Trump\u2019s rallying cry as he sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The legislation would deny special government employees and anyone with conflicts of interest or a lack of appropriate clearance any access to the Treasury payment system. It also would include personal tax information into existing privacy protections, according to Schumer.",
      "The White House said Monday that Musk received status as a special government employee, meaning he\u2019s a short-term federal worker who works under looser ethics rules.",
      "Jeffries said the legislation will be introduced \u201cin short order\u201d to prevent \u201cunlawful access with respect to the Department of Treasury's payment system connected to people who are trying to steal personal, sensitive and confidential information related to Social Security recipients, Medicare recipients, taxpayers, businesses, not-for-profits, veterans and everyday Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is unacceptable, unconscionable and unAmerican,\u201d he said.",
      "Given the Republican majority in both chambers of Congress, it is unlikely the legislation will advance. However, Schumer and Jeffries outlined other avenues Democrats could take. Schumer threatened to block funding legislation until there are changes and added that Democrats would also hold shadow hearings with whistleblowers.",
      "Though the leaders repeatedly mentioned DOGE, they stayed away from directly saying Elon Musk\u2019s name until asked by reporters.",
      "Jeffries avoided saying the legislation was solely focused on Musk but rather centered around the \u201cwhole process\u201d of the recent Treasury moves, when asked how concerned he was specifically about the Tesla founder.",
      "\u201cWe're concerned that Musk is in charge of DOGE, but we're concerned about the how the whole process works, and ultimately the buck falls with Donald Trump, the president,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cBut we are concerned that a small number of people are concerned with the whole process, including Musk and including the others,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "The Democrats repeatedly downplayed DOGE\u2019s power.",
      "\u201cIt has no authority to make spending decisions, to shut down programs or ignore federal law. This is not debatable. This is an indisputable fact: No authority for spending decisions to shut down programs or ignore federal law,\u201d Schumer warned.",
      "Schumer said that \"all 47 Democrats\" in the Senate would oppose the confirmation of Office of Management and Budget nominee Russell Vought in light of the federal funding freezes announced last week.",
      "\u201cWe are united in our agreement that Russell Vought is a dangerous and destructive choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, and we saw a precursor to his leadership last week during the dangerous federal funding fees that crippled nearly crippled critical duties of the federal government and its operations,\" Schumer said.",
      "\u201cSenate Democrats will unanimously oppose him and do everything we can to prevent him from needing OMB,\u201d he added.",

    "summary": "Sens. Susan Collins, James Lankford and Todd Young said they'll vote to confirm the DNI nominee.",
    "story": [
      "Gabbard gained support from three key Republican senators.",
      "The Senate Intelligence Committee voted to advance former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's nomination for director of national intelligence in a closed-door session on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Gabbard advanced in a 9-8 vote along party lines, according to senators leaving the meeting. All Republicans voted in favor of Gabbard while all Democrats opposed her, according to a source familiar with the vote.",
      "The vote followed Gabbard's at-times contentious confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill last Thursday, where she was grilled over her views on government secrets leaker Edward Snowden and her refusal to label him a traitor.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune can now begin to move her nomination to the full floor for consideration. A final vote will likely take place later this week or early next week.",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic Hawaii member of Congress turned Republican, picked up three key Republican votes on Monday from Sens. Susan Collins, James Lankford and Todd Young. They had previously been critical of her past statements on Snowden and her opposition to government surveillance programs. Gabbard can only afford to lose one Republican vote on the committee.",
      "During Thursday's hearing, lawmakers from both parties repeatedly pressed Gabbard to disavow her past support of Snowden, a former intelligence contractor who fled the country with more than 1 million classified records. Gabbard previously described Snowden as a \"brave\" whistleblower who exposed civil liberties violations by the intelligence community. While in Congress, she introduced legislation stating that \"Snowden's disclosure of this program to journalists was in the public interest, and the Federal Government should drop all charges.\"",
      "While Gabbard repeatedly stated that Snowden \"broke the law,\" she did not back away from her previous statements and refused to call him a \"traitor\" despite being asked several times by senators from both parties.",
      "In an op-ed in Newsweek over the weekend, Gabbard wrote that she explained in the closed session in her confirmation hearing why she refused to call him that.",
      "\"Treason is a capital offense, punishable by death, yet politicians like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former US Senator Mitt Romney have slandered me, Donald Trump Jr. and others with baseless accusations of treason. It is essential to focus on the facts, not the label. Snowden should have raised his concerns about illegal surveillance through authorized channels, such as the Inspector General or the Intelligence Committee, instead of leaking to the media.\"",
      "Gabbard also presented a four-point plan to prevent future Snowden-like leaks, which includes oversight to ensure there are no illegal intelligence collection programs, minimizing access to sensitive intelligence, informing government workers about legal options for whistleblowers, and creating a hotline for whistleblowers to contact Gabbard directly.",
      "Several senators questioned Gabbard's past opposition to government surveillance programs under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which allows the U.S. government to collect electronic communications of non-Americans outside the country without a warrant. Gabbard, who voted against the provision as a member of Congress, said changes made to the program since she left office were enough to earn her support.",
      "Gabbard faces perhaps the most difficult route to confirmation of all of President Donald Trump's Cabinet picks. She cannot afford to lose any Republican votes in the committee. Her nomination is expected to be voted on during a closed-door confirmation session on Tuesday.",
      "A source with knowledge of the proceedings told ABC News that newly confirmed CIA Director John Ratcliffe, former NSA adviser Robert O'Brien and former Sen. Richard Burr, a former Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, have been making calls to senators on Gabbard's behalf. Gabbard has also talked to senators since her hearing, a source said.",
      "Over the weekend, Young faced pressure from Gabbard and Trump allies, but on Tuesday, Young, who was believed to be the final key vote needed for Gabbard's nomination to move from the committee to the Senate floor, announced he would support her.",
      "\"I have done what the Framers envisioned for senators to do: use the consultative process to seek firm commitments, in this case commitments that will advance our national security, which is my top priority as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer,\" Young posted. \"Having now secured these commitments, I will support Tulsi's nomination and look forward to working with her to protect our national security.\"",
      "In a now-deleted post on X ahead over the weekend, Elon Musk said Young was a \"deep state puppet.\" However, hours later, Musk deleted the post and said, \"Just had an excellent conversation with @SenToddYoung. I stand corrected. Senator Young will be a great ally in restoring power to the people from the vast, unelected bureaucracy.\"",
      "Meghan McCain, a close ally of Gabbard, also voiced her support over the weekend, posting, \"Any Senator who votes against @TulsiGabbard for DNI isn't just going to have a problem with MAGA and Trump - I will make it my personal mission to help campaign and fundraise against you in your next election. And my people are probably a lot like their people,\" she added.",
      "Young, who did not endorse Trump in his presidential campaign, had a heated exchange with Gabbard during her hearing.",
      "\"Did [Snowden] betray the trust of the American people?\" Young asked.",
      "\"Edward Snowden broke the law,\" Gabbard responded, \"and he released this information in a way that he should not have.\"",

      "The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death. The organization said he passed peacefully at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on Sunday.",
      "Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be recognized until decades later.",
      "\u201cHarry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long after fighting for our country in World War II,\u201d Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said.",
      "Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his life titled \u201cSoaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen\u2019s Firsthand Account of World War II.\u201d In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips of their P-51 Mustangs.",
      "\u201cI did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up to my duty,\u201d Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN about the war.",
      "Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups.",
      "\u201cI got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling of belonging to something that was really big,\u201d Stewart said in a 2020 interview with WAMC.",
      "Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his book.",
      "Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a mechanical engineering degree New York University. He relocated to Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline company.",
      "Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the aircraft.",
      "\u201cWhen I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to my eyes is that they were both female,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "The Air Force last month briefly removed training course s with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash."

      "Next-door neighbors lost their near-identical homes in a California wildfire, but how they are navigating rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, a stark reflection of the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\u201cI chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\u201d said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they\u2019ll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\u201cIt changes the whole trajectory to your life,\u201d said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin\u2019s home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can\u2019t get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.\u2019\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \u201cdifficult but purposeful business decisions\u201d in California.",
      "Mercury didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson\u2019s case, and noted that it\u2019s difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn\u2019t cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\u201cBeing able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\u201d Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\u201cHalf the time, I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\u201cI could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It\u2019s just luck, really. It\u2019s nothing I did or didn\u2019t do,\u201d Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \u201cI had the same risk factors as everyone else.\u201d",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all trying to manage their exposure,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIf you think about wildfires, you don\u2019t want concentrated exposure.\u201d",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn\u2019t get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that\u2019s very, very painful,\u201d said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \u201cdone everything the insurers asked California to do\u201d but yielded little success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we\u2019re not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of risk in the system and there\u2019s a big question of who is going to pay for this,\u201d Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he\u2019ll have to take out loans to rebuild. He\u2019s considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can\u2019t fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he\u2019s thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cStuck paying for an insurance that doesn\u2019t cover anything. You don\u2019t want to live in a risky area. You don\u2019t have the safety net.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is set to stand trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as still pictures and documentation, Schmidt has said. An estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of a trial that is projected to last several weeks, he said.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not detailed how he plans to defend his client against the charges. He has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal in light of the prosecution's case.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for any prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

Rose knew just what to do. She helped her baby up right away. The kid was standing on her own within 15 minutes and took her first steps soon after that.\u201d",
      "Rose-Tu and her baby, who is nursing regularly, are doing well, Kelsey Wallace from the zoo's communications team said Tuesday.",
      "The calf is Rose-Tu's third baby. Her firstborn, 16-year-old Samudra, also lives at the zoo. Her second calf, Lily, passed away from a virus in 2018, just before she turned 6 years old.",
      "It might be a while before the new baby and Rose-Tu are ready for visitors. Staff want to make sure the calf continues to do well, and that Rose-Tu is calm and comfortable with people around, Lefave said.",
      "\u201cRose is a fantastic mom,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s so gentle and protective, and the calf is already nursing well. These are signs that they will have a strong bond, which is exactly what we want to see. We\u2019re ready to help if needed, but so far mom and baby are doing just fine on their own.\u201d",

      "Congress is proving little match for the Department of Government Efficiency as wary lawmakers watch it march through the bureaucracy",
      "WASHINGTON -- When Elon Musk debuted the Department of Government Efficiency recently at the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson enthusiastically predicted the coming Trump administration would bring \u201ca lot of change around here.\u201d",
      "Three weeks in, the change the Trump administration has brought is a disruption of the federal government on an unprecedented scale, dismantling longstanding programs, sparking widespread public outcry and challenging the very role of Congress to create the nation\u2019s laws and pay its bills.",
      "Government workers are being pushed to resign. Entire agencies are being shuttered. Federal funding to states and nonprofits was temporarily frozen. And the most sensitive Treasury Department information of countless Americans was opened to Musk\u2019s DOGE team in an unprecedented breach of privacy and protocol.",
      "\u201cThis is an erosion of our democracy,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a longtime economic adviser to conservative Republicans, now at the Manhattan Institute think tank.",
      "President Donald Trump has tapped Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, to take on inner workings of the world\u2019s oldest democracy, and so far the results are stunning, if not alarming and unlawful, being challenged in dozens of court cases nationwide.",
      "Congress is proving little match for DOGE as wary lawmakers watch it march through the bureaucracy. Instead, a rush of lawsuits is demanding interventions to stop the Republican president's team from unilaterally gutting government. And protests are erupting outside government agencies and clogging the congressional phone lines.",
      "\u201cWhatever DOGE is doing, it is certainly not \u2014 not \u2014 what democracy looks like or has ever looked like in the grand history of this country,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.",
      "\"An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government,\u201d Schumer posted on Musk's social media site X.",
      "Musk responded on his platform: \u201cHysterical reactions like this is how you know that DOGE is doing work that really matters.\u201d",
      "Congress has been here before, tested during Trump\u2019s first term by his willingness to break the norms and skirt the outer banks of legality, most notably when he steamrolled Congress and poached federal military housing and construction funds to build parts of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "But Trump\u2019s second-term partnership with Musk, who spent some $200 million on Trump's White House bid and employs the tech world ethos of moving fast and breaking things, is escalating the confrontation. On a stated quest to save money by rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, they are making moves to upend American institutions, decimate the civil service and leave a reformed \u2014 or hollowed-out \u2014 federal government in its place.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said it would be \u201ccatastrophic to our system of government\u201d if the effort succeeds.",
      "\u201cMany of the things they are doing are brazenly unlawful, and we\u2019ve seen that the courts have been willing to intervene \u2014 and intervene quickly,\u201d Parrott said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real readiness and understanding of the stakes.\u201d",
      "In many ways, Trump is pursuing by force what Republicans have long promised but have been unable to deliver by congressional action: shrinking the size and scope of the federal government. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist quipped more than a decade ago about the goal of making government small enough to drown in a bathtub.",
      "But facing pushback from within their ranks about cutting programs Americans rely upon, Republicans have repeatedly failed to accomplish their budget-slashing goals even when they fully control Congress and the White House, as they do now.",
      "While Congress has the power to pass legislation to fund government operations, the president can veto bills or sign them into law. Instead, Trump is testing an idea championed by his nominee for budget director, Russ Vought, that the executive has the ability to \u201cimpound\u201d federal funds, clawing the money back.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said DOGE provides \u201ccover\u201d for some Republicans who want to cut federal funds, when Congress has failed to do so.",
      "And other Republicans say they are comfortable with Trump's pause of certain federal operations, particularly the U.S. Agency for International Development, which sends aid around the world. Closing the Department of Education is next on deck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got oversight,\u201d said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. \u201cIf he goes too far, I\u2019ll be the first person to step up.\u201d",
      "Taken together the actions of the administration and DOGE have been swift, relentless and wide open to debate.",
      "Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget's move to abruptly freeze federal grants and loans drew outrage nationwide as states and nonprofit organizations feared being locked out of funds they need to provide housing, health care and other services. A day later, the White House reversed course.",
      "The shutdown of funds to USAID is largely seen as a test case for the Impoundment Control Act, which Vought has discussed using as a way to roll back congressionally approved funding. Vought's nomination is on track for Senate confirmation this week, despite all Senate Democrats saying they will oppose him.",
      "And DOGE dipped into the inner-workings of the Treasury Department to access its payment system \u2014 and the private information of millions of Americans \u2014 in what is widely viewed as a way for the White House to eventually stop federal funds to various entities.",
      "On Monday, U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan said the administration's actions with the federal funding \u201cpotentially run roughshod over a \u2018bulwark of the Constitution\u2019 by interfering with Congress\u2019s appropriation of federal funds.\u201d",
      "\u201cDefendants\u2019 actions appear to suffer from infirmities of a constitutional magnitude,\" she wrote, extending an order issued last week that had paused OMB's sweeping funding freeze. \u201cThe appropriation of the government\u2019s resources is reserved for Congress, not the Executive Branch.

      "The head of Italy's fashion chamber says he has appealed to its government to protect the country\u2019s second-largest industry from possible tariffs from the Trump administration",
      "MILAN -- The head of Italy's fashion chamber said he has appealed to its government to protect the country's second-largest industry from possible tariffs from the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe hope they don\u2019t arrive,\u2019\u2019 Italian National Fashion Chamber President Carlo Capasa said Wednesday during the presentation of the calendar for the next Milan Fashion Week later this month. \u201cIf Trump penalizes the second industry in Italy, it is a pretty hostile declaration.\u201d",
      "Fashion generates 5% of Italy's GDP, or 75 billion euros ($78 billion), through the production and sale of textiles, apparel and footwear, and with 1.2 million employees, according to a study by the state development bank CDP released in December.",
      "The threat of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump is creating uncertainty in the industry as it experiences a global contraction that shrank global sales in 2024 by 5%, dropping to 96 billion euros from 110 billion euros in 2023, according to figures released by the fashion chamber. Beyond textiles, apparel and footwear, the figures also include jewelry, eyewear and leather goods.",
      "While Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on European imports to the United States, he has not made clear plans.",
      "Italy exported 4.6 billion euros worth of luxury fashion to the United States during the first 10 months of last year, including apparel, footwear, leather goods, jewelry and eyewear. It is the third market following France and Germany, with 7.6 billion euros and 4.7 billion euros in sales of Italian luxury fashion, respectively, during the same period.",
      "Exports in the same period were up 2.5% to 91 billion euros, according to the fashion chamber data.",
      "Despite the drop in global sales, the industry is still topping the results before the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales of 90 billion euros in 2019."

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products",
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days. The delay followed negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Late Tuesday, the U.S. Postal Service announced it is temporarily suspending acceptance of inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "The D",
      "WASHINGTON -- The D.C. Council voted unanimously Tuesday to expel Councilmember Trayon White, who faces a federal trial on charges of taking tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to influence city contract decisions.",
      "White, 40, was arrested by the FBI last August. His federal trial won\u2019t start until January 2026, but preliminary evidence shows White pocketing cash-stuffed envelopes from a city contractor-turned-informer.",
      "Tuesday's hearing on the matter was relatively quick. An internal council inquiry had already recommended expulsion. Votes from 11 of the 12 remaining council members were required for expulsion, but the vote was unanimous.",
      "\u201cBribery of elected officials is quintessential corruption,\u201d Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said before the vote. \u201cTrust is precious. Trust is critical for an elected government, and we must act.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s first time in modern D.C. history that the council has expelled a member. Most recently, in 2019, former Councilmember Jack Evans \u2014 facing multiple charges of ethics violations \u2014 resigned ahead of an expulsion vote.",
      "White came up in local politics as a protege of iconic and infamous former Mayor Marion Barry. And White has been channeling his mentor's defiant, populist playbook since his arrest.",
      "He refused to cooperate with the internal council inquiry. His lawyer, Frederick D. Cooke Jr., also served as Barry\u2019s defense attorney. And White has sought to stoke lingering suspicion of the FBI among Black Washingtonians, many of whom believe Barry was unfairly targeted by the 1990 FBI sting that caught him on camera smoking crack cocaine.",
      "During Tuesday's council hearing, White sat silently in the audience surrounded by supporters. Meanwhile, a panel truck sat parked outside the D.C. government building with an electronic display showing a picture of White and the message \u201cFBI set me up.\u201d Another image in the shifting display showed a picture of Mendelson underneath the word \u201cRacist.\u201d",
      "Last week, White showed up at a council hearing on his case wearing a T-shirt that declared \u201cTHE FBI KILLED FRED HAMPTON\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Illinois Black Panther Party leader who was killed during a police raid in 1969.",
      "Even before his legal troubles, White was closely associated with the Barry legacy, frequently appearing at his side later in his life. White represents Ward 8 \u2014 D.C.\u2019s poorest and Blackest district \u2014 in the seat Barry held for years. In 2018, when a statue of Barry was erected outside the D.C. government building, White went on local radio to defend Barry\u2019s legacy against critics.",
      "As a councilmember, White channeled Barry\u2019s street-level style \u2014 building loyalty by personally appearing throughout his ward, especially at crime scenes, at all hours of the day.",
      "\u201cHe was trained by Barry, and Barry would do that. He would show up for everything from a birthday or a barbecue to a shooting scene,\u201d said Robinson Woodward-Burns, a political science professor at Washington\u2019s Howard University.",
      "And in true Barry style, the arrest and strength of evidence did little to dent his popularity; less than three months later he was reelected to a third term in November with limited opposition.",
      "Arrest and public scandal may not be the end of White's political career, much like that of his mentor. White is free to enter the special election that will be called to fill his seat as long as he hasn't been convicted of a felony. His trial starts next year.",
      "George Musgrove, author of \u201c Chocolate City, A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation\u2019s Capital,\u201d said he believes White is making a \u201cfalse comparison\u201d in wrapping himself in the Barry legacy.",
      "Barry boasted a legitimate pre-politics resume as a pioneering civil rights activist, Musgrove said, serving as the first chairman of the seminal Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee before coming to Washington in 1965 to run the local SNCC office. And as mayor, Barry is regarded as having enriched and elevated other Black residents, and partially credited with helping create the robust Black middle class that populates the D.C. area.",
      "\u201cTrayon wants to play that role, but he\u2019s never built up that history,\u201d said Musgrove, a history professor at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. \u201cSo that goodwill is only going to stretch so far.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, Musgrove said he thinks White would have a decent chance of regaining his seat in a special election. In a ward where voter turnout in a nonpresidential election year usually hovers in the teens, he said it would take a strong candidate with broad coalition support to challenge White's organized loyalists.",
      "\u201cWhat he learned from Barry is how to cultivate a relatively small but pretty fervent electoral base in a low-turnout ward,\u201d Musgrove said. \u201cHe only has to mobilize a couple thousand people.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump suggested that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and proposed the U.S. take \u201cownership\u201d in redeveloping the area into \u201cthe Riviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s brazen proposal Tuesday appears certain to roil the next stage of talks meant to extend the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and secure the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza.",
      "The provocative comments came as talks are ramping up this week with the promise of surging humanitarian aid and reconstruction supplies to help the people of Gaza recover after more than 15 months of devastating conflict. Now Trump wants to push roughly 1.8 million people to leave the land they have called home and claim it for the U.S., perhaps with American troops.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,\u201d Trump said at an evening news conference with Netanyahu by his side. The president who made his name as a New York real estate developer added: \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that it\u2019s done world-class. It\u2019ll be wonderful for the people \u2014 Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Trump outlined his thinking as he held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, where the two leaders also discussed the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israeli-Hamas conflict and shared concerns about Iran.",
      "Trump said the U.S. would redevelop the territory after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and turn the territory into a place where the \u201cworld's people\u201d\u2014 including Palestinians \u2014 would live. He offered no detail about what authority the U.S. would use to take the land and develop it.",
      "Egypt, Jordan and other U.S. allies in the Mideast have cautioned Trump that relocating Palestinians from Gaza would threaten Mideast stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine a decades-long push by the U.S. and allies for a two-state solution.",
      "Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry issued a sharply worded reaction to Trump, noting their long call for an independent Palestinian state was a \u201cfirm, steadfast and unwavering position.\u201d Saudi Arabia has been in negotiations with the U.S. over a deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for a security pact and other terms.",
      "\u201cThe duty of the international community today is to work to alleviate the severe human suffering endured by the Palestinian people, who will remain committed to their land and will not budge from it,\" the Saudi statement said.",
      "Still, Trump insists the Palestinians \u201chave no alternative\u201d but to leave the \"big pile of rubble\u201d that is Gaza. He spoke out as his top aides stressed that a three-to-five-year timeline for reconstruction of the war-torn territory, as laid out in a temporary truce agreement, is not viable.",
      "Last week, both Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II dismissed Trump's calls to resettle Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "But Trump said he believes Egypt and Jordan \u2014 as well as other countries, which he did not name \u2014 will ultimately agree to take in Palestinians.",
      "\u201cYou look over the decades, it\u2019s all death in Gaza,\u201d Trump said. \"This has been happening for years. It\u2019s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what\u2019s happening in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Trump also said he isn\u2019t ruling out deploying U.S. troops to support reconstruction of Gaza. He envisions \u201clong-term\u201d U.S. ownership of a redevelopment of the territory.",
      "The president's proposal was greeted with alarm by Democrats and a measure of skepticism by his Republican allies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s completely lost it,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cHe wants a U.S. invasion of Gaza, which would cost thousands of American lives and set the Middle East on fire for 20 years? It\u2019s sick.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what our Arab friends say about that,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and a Trump ally. \"And I think most South Carolinians are probably not excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza. I think that might be problematic, but I\u2019ll keep an open mind.\u201d",
      "The White House's focus on the future of Gaza comes as the nascent truce between Israel and Hamas hangs in the balance.",
      "Netanyahu is facing competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and for the 15-month conflict to end.",
      "Trump may be betting he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu\u2019s government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza.",
      "\u201cTo me, it is unfair to explain to Palestinians that they might be back in five years,\u201d Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, said. \u201cThat\u2019s just preposterous.\u201d",
      "Trump also signaled that he may be reconsidering an independent Palestinian state as part of a broader two-state solution to the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict.",
      "\u201cWell, a lot of plans change with time,\u201d he told reporters when asked if he was still committed to a plan like the one he laid out in 2020 that called for a Palestinian state. \u201cA lot of death has occurred since I left and now came back.\"",
      "Netanyahu's arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump's second term coincides with the prime minister's popular support sagging.",
      "The prime minister is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu\u2019s standing.",
      "\u201cWe have the right leader of Israel who\u2019s done a great job,\" Trump said of Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu praised Trump's leadership in getting the hostage and ceasefire deal. The prime minister also spoke glowingly of Trump thinking outside the box.",
      "\u201cYou say things others refuse to say. And after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, 'You know he\u2019s right.'\"",
      "Hamas in a statement decried Trump\u2019s comments.",
      "\u201cWe reject Trump\u2019s statements in which he said that the residents of the Gaza Strip have no choice but to leave, and we consider them a recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region,\" the group said.",
      "Netanyahu met with White House national security adviser Mike Waltz and Witkoff on Monday to begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement.",
      "The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel\u2019s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week.",
      "Witkoff, meanwhile, said he plans to meet with Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, in Florida on Thursday to discuss the next phase in the ceasefire. Qatar and Egypt have served as key intermediaries with Hamas throughout the conflict.",
      "Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu\u2019s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn\u2019t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections.",
      "Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces\u2019 full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.",

      "A lawsuit accuses the University of California of racial discrimination in undergraduate admissions by favoring Black and Latino students over Asian American and white applicants",
      "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A lawsuit filed this week accuses the University of California of racial discrimination in undergraduate admissions by favoring Black and Latino students over Asian American and white applicants.",
      "A group called Students Against Racial Discrimination sued Monday in federal court, alleging the university system admits students with inferior academic credentials at the expense of better-qualified ones.",
      "The complaint claims UC's admissions practices violate a state law approved by voters in 1996 that forbids considering race and other factors in public education, public employment and public contracting.",
      "In addition, the filing alleges that the California campuses are violating the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars federal funds recipients from discriminating based on race.",
      "UC officials didn't immediately respond Tuesday to emails and phone calls seeking comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit asks a judge to block the university system with 10 campuses from asking about race in student applications and to appoint a court monitor to oversee admission decisions.",
      "Asian American and white applicants are discriminated against because of their race, while Latino and Black students are \u201coften placed at a significant academic disadvantage, and thus experience worse outcomes, because of the university\u2019s use of racial preferences,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "\u201cStudents of all races are harmed by the University of California\u2019s discriminatory behavior,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "It accuses UC officials of ordering campuses to use a \u201cholistic\u201d review of undergraduate admissions, \u201cin other words, that they move away from objective criteria towards more subjective assessments of the overall appeal of individual candidates.\u201d",
      "As an example, the filing cites a statistic that in 2010 the University of California, Berkeley admitted 13% of Black, in-state students, compared with an overall 21% admission rate. By 2023, the Black admissions rate at Berkeley was 10%, compared to an overall rate of 12%, the complaint said.",
      "The lawsuit comes more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, declaring race cannot be a factor and forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies."

      "The media group Semafor has visions for creating an economic forum for the United States that rivals the annual event in Davos, Switzerland",
      "NEW YORK -- The media company Semafor is planning a Washington economic conference for global CEOs this April that it hopes will rival the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for influence.",
      "Semafor said Wednesday that more than 200 CEOs have already committed to attend the event, now in its third year, representing an explosion of interest it credits in large part to curiosity about the policies of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cIt is really turning into what will be the closest thing to what Davos has accomplished in Switzerland,\u201d said Justin B. Smith, co-founder and CEO of Semafor. The conference is scheduled for April 23-25.",
      "The event illustrates the growing importance of special events for media companies, a focus of Semafor's leaders since the company started earlier this decade.",
      "A similar Washington conference two years ago brought together about 50 CEOs, and leadership attendance expanded to about 75 in 2024. While that growth showed interest in monitoring regulatory efforts in Washington, there's little doubt what has propelled the interest this year, Smith said.",
      "\u201cTrump's election has added fuel to the project's acceleration and growth,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Semafor hopes that Trump administration officials also attend, adding to the news value, but none have been booked yet, with the president's team still staffing up. Semafor's journalists will help lead a series of discussions on topics like global finance, energy, growth and the tech revolution.",
      "With other finance leaders and spectators, Semafor is hoping for about 5,000 people to attend its conference. Leaders of Netflix, FedEx, Instacart, Mattel, United Airlines, Whole Foods and WeWork are among the confirmed attendees, the company said.",
      "The event is co-chaired by David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group;, Henry Kravis, co-founder of KR; Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel; and former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker."

Lindsey Graham, one of President Donald Trump's closest congressional allies, is kicking off his pursuit of a fifth term with two of his home state's top Republicans chairing his 2026 campaign, an early show of strength in a race where the longtime lawmaker is expected to face primary challengers.",
      "Graham's campaign told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Henry McMaster will chair his 2026 run. Scott, the state's junior senator, is current chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the chamber's campaign arm and \u2014 after challenging Trump for the 2024 presidential nomination \u2014 campaigned for him during the GOP primary.",
      "McMaster recently became the state's longest-serving governor, having been elected to two terms of his own after serving the remaining two years of Nikki Haley's term after she became Trump's first ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "Both McMaster and Scott were surrogates for Trump in the 2024 presidential campaign, and their early support for Graham in his own bid is intended as a signal of strength for the incumbent in a state where Trump has maintained high popularity since his 2016 run.",
      "It's also an early strike in the race, where Graham \u2014 as he typically does \u2014 is expected to face primary challengers. The Trump confidant has long been targeted by the far right in his state, critiqued by his own party and booed at a home-state rally.",

      "He has even drawn boos at some events of the party faithful in his home state. That includes a July 2023 Trump rally in Pickens \u2014 in the county where Graham grew up \u2014 where objections from the crowd drowned out more than five minutes of his remarks. When he took the stage, Trump also elicited boos when he mentioned Graham\u2019s name, saying he was \u201cgoing to have to work on these people\u201d and adding that Graham is \u201cthere when you need him.\u201d",
      "Last month, Graham's campaign said he had more than $15.6 million cash on hand for his reelection bid, including nearly a million raised in the last quarter of 2024 alone. In 2020, Graham bested several GOP challengers before going on to defeat Democratic nominee Jaime Harrison \u2014 who recently ended his term as Democratic National Committee chairman \u2014 by a margin of 10 percentage points.",
      "Potential Republican primary challengers for this cycle include South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against U.S. Rep. William Timmons.",

      "San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors appears ready to grant newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie greater powers to expedite the city\u2019s response to its fentanyl and homelessness crisis",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco's Board of Supervisors is poised to grant newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie greater powers and flexibility to expedite the city's response to a fentanyl crisis that has turned sidewalks into open-air dens of drug consumption and homelessness.",
      "The legislation, which supervisors will vote on Tuesday, eliminates competitive bidding requirements for some contracts and allows the administration to solicit private donations to quickly add 1,500 shelter beds and hire more public safety and behavioral health specialists. It is the first piece of legislation for Lurie, a Levi Strauss heir and anti-poverty nonprofit founder who had never held elective office until he squashed Mayor London Breed's reelection bid last year.",
      "The proposal already has the six votes needed to pass, and will likely pick up more votes Tuesday.",
      "The 11-member board relinquishing oversight powers for an effort with no concrete plan or accountability metrics underscores how desperate supervisors are for a solution. It also signals their embrace \u2014 for now \u2014 of a political outsider who pledged to work collaboratively to create common-sense solutions.",
      "Supervisor Connie Chan said last week at the budget and finance committee she chairs that board oversight helps ensure taxpayer money is spent judiciously and transparently. But she also said this is \u201ctruly an unprecedented time\" that calls for unusual measures, and she appreciated the mayor's willingness to compromise. Breed had a frosty relationship with the board's progressive members, Chan included.",
      "San Francisco has long been known for its liberal politics, but homeless tent encampments and public drug use surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overdose deaths fueled by cheap and potent fentanyl reached a record high in San Francisco of over 800 in 2023.",
      "In response, frustrated residents voted to enhance police powers and backed crackdowns on street homelessness. They also elected more moderate Democrats to the board.",
      "Lurie's proposal would allow the city to bypass the competitive bidding and procurement process for contracts, grants and leases related to addiction, homelessness and public safety hiring. City departments could sign new leases without board approval. He wants to open a 24-hour drop-off center that would be friendly to police and an alternative to jail.",
      "Supervisors would have only 45 days to vote on contracts up to $25 million \u2014 down from the original $50 million proposed by the mayor \u2014 or relinquish their oversight. Expedited contracting would sunset in one year, down from the original five.",
      "San Francisco AIDS Foundation opposes the proposal because it lacks metrics and details, such as how it would actually reduce fentanyl use, said Laura Thomas, the nonprofit's drug policy expert and senior director of HIV & harm reduction policy.",
      "She applauds the mayor's desire for more housing and treatment services but hopes he will not endorse policies forcing people into treatment, which has shown to be ineffective and often counterproductive.",
      "\u201cWe want to know more about what the proposal is,\u201d Thomas said Monday. \u201cWe're raising notes of concern and we want to know more information before we can support it.\u201d",
      "At Wednesday's budget and finance committee, legislative analyst Nicolas Menard warned that waiving competitive bids would likely increase service costs and \u201ccreate opportunities for waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d The fiscal impact is unknown, but the grants and contracts budget for the affected city departments totals just over $1 billion.",
      "\u201cI need to be very clear that you\u2019re giving up a lot here,\" he said.",
      "Still, it passed out of committee to the full board with a unanimous recommendation and in a statement released later that day, Lurie said that with the ordinance \u201cwe are no longer looking the other way \u2014 we are treating the fentanyl crisis like the emergency it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a new era in City Hall.\u201d"

His appeals have been denied by state and federal courts, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied a stay of execution on Jan. 28. Nelson's attorneys this week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and halt his execution, to give them more time to challenge his conviction.",
      "While awaiting trial, Nelson was indicted in the killing of another jail inmate. He was never tried on that charge after his guilty verdict and death sentence. During his trial, Nelson broke an electronic shock cuff off his ankle, and later broke a water pipe in a holding cell, flooding the courtroom with foul black water. He also regularly unshackled his handcuffs and ankle restraints by using a key he was hiding in his genitals.",
      "Texas has three more executions scheduled before the end of April.",
      "The first is scheduled for Feb. 13. Richard Lee Tabler was condemned for gunning down a strip club manager and the manager's friend on Thanksgiving weekend in 2004. Tabler also acknowledged killing two dancers from the club. He was charged with their slayings but was never tried."

    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

      "Efforts to keep potentially disease-ridden meat out of the UK are being undermined by post-Brexit border checks, a senior health official has said.",
      "The boss of the Dover Port Health Authority said illegal meat, which has not been through proper health checks, was now available on \"most high streets\" in the UK.",
      "European outbreaks of deadly animal diseases in recent months have left health authorities, Whitehall officials and many in the farming industry worried about the threat they pose to the UK.",
      "But the government has insisted the checks work and it will never \"waver in its duty to support the UK's biosecurity\".",
      "Under the post-Brexit system, checks on commercial vehicles do not take place at Dover itself.",
      "Instead, drivers are ordered to travel 22 miles (35km) away to a border control post at Sevington.",
      "But critics have warned that many lorries are simply failing to turn up for the checks, due to a lack of enforcement.",
      "Parliament's Environment Select Committee has now launched an inquiry into whether the system is working.",
      "Lucy Manzano, head of the Dover Port Health Authority, told MPs on the committee that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had been overstating the effectiveness of the system.",
      "She said: \"Defra have continually stated that there are robust controls in place. There are not. They don't exist.\"",
      "She added that the department had failed to provide \"any confirmation of how food would be controlled at the point it arrives, or more importantly, between the point it arrives and the inspection facility that is accessed 22 miles across\".",
      "Ms Manzano said she had presented evidence to the government \"to demonstrate that the system brought in place to safeguard this country from a biosecurity point of view\u2026 is not working\".",
      "Defra refused to answer a recent Freedom of Information request from the BBC's Countryfile programme, asking how many vehicles were failing to turn up for checks at Sevington.",
      "The department claimed that releasing data about Sevington could inadvertently aid criminals looking for weak points in the UK's border controls.",
      "Almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat seized at port",
      "Action demanded over surge in illegal meat imports",
      "Ms Manzano claimed illegal meat has now become much more commonplace in high street shops - and that it is becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to spot if the product they are buying has gone through proper health checks.",
      "It is understood that the view inside Defra is that the post-Brexit checks are working as they should.",
      "Earlier this week figures showed that almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat was seized at the Port of Dover last year.",
      "Defra said it is \"unequivocal that importing illegal meat products is unacceptable \u2013 which is why suspected products are routinely checked at the border to ensure they don't reach our shores\".",
      "A BBC News investigation last year found that unprecedented levels of seizures had sparked fears of more organised criminal activity.",
      "A similar health check facility to the one at Sevington does exist on site at Dover, but it is understood that the government chose not to use it because of worries about potential traffic queues forming at the border.",
      "Ms Manzano said that decision was \"not based on biosecurity\" and added that \"the very purpose of import controls is to keep the bad stuff out and contain it at first point of entry\".",
      "Last month the UK government introduced strict restrictions on the import of German meat, following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But Ms Manzano said failures in the IT system introduced since Brexit meant that products which should have been undergoing checks were allowed to freely enter the UK for \"at least six days\".",
      "When the current system was introduced last year, the government also gave funding to Dover Port Health Authority to carry out spot checks on smaller vehicles directly at the border.",
      "Figures show the vast majority of illegal meat seized in the UK is caught through those spot checks.",
      "But Ms Manzano said that funding was due to run out in seven weeks and that without further government cash the checks would have to stop.",
      "Government discussions are ongoing about how to best fund border checks.",
      "It is understood the decision to put the checks at Sevington has likely had a direct negative impact on how much money goes to the Dover Port Health Authority.",
      "A Defra spokesperson refused to comment on ongoing spending decisions."

    "summary": "China has set out a series of measures to kick in next week after the US introduced 10% tariffs on imports from the country.",
    "story": [
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated after China hit back against the introduction of tariffs by the US with measures of its own.",
      "Beijing has set out to target specific American goods with retaliatory taxes, among other measures, following the blanket 10% tariff introduced by President Donald Trump on all Chinese imports to the US.",
      "In some ways, this latest tit-for-tat is nothing new and builds on the long-running trade dispute between the nations, with tariffs having already been imposed and threatened on various goods since 2018.",
      "Trump has said he plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, so a deal could yet be struck. But if China proceeds with its response on 10 February as planned, what could the impact be?",
      "Coal, oil and gas",
      "Part of China's countermeasures to Trump's tariffs is to announce import taxes of its own on US coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 10%, and a 15% charge on crude oil.",
      "The response from Beijing means companies wanting to import fossil fuels from the US would have to pay the tax in order to do so.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of coal, but it gets most of it from Indonesia, although Russia, Australia and Mongolia are also among its suppliers.",
      "When it comes to the US, China has been increasing imports of LNG from the country, with volumes nearly double 2018 levels, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "But its overall fossil fuel trade is modest, with US imports accounting for just 1.7% of China's total crude oil bought from abroad in 2023. This suggests China is not dependent on the US and so the impact of the tariffs on its economy could be minimal.",
      "Rebecca Harding, a trade economist and chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security think tank, said China could easily source more supplies from Russia, where it has already been buying oil on the cheap as the Kremlin seeks to fund its war effort.",
      "On the flipside, the US is the world's largest LNG exporter, and so has plenty of other customers, particularly the UK and the European Union.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?Trump sows uncertainty - and Xi Jinping sees an opportunity",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?",
      "Trump sows uncertainty - and Xi Jinping sees an opportunity",
      "Agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks and big cars",
      "As well as fuel, China has slapped a 10% tariff on agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks, and some large cars.",
      "But China is not a big importer of US pick-ups and it gets most of its cars from Europe and Japan, so a 10% tariff on an already small number of imports would not hit consumers too hard.",
      "In recent years, China has increased investments in farm machinery to enhance production and reduce reliance on imports, and to strengthen its food security.",
      "So the introduction of tariffs on agricultural machinery might be another move to try to boost domestic industry.",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at consultancy Capital Economics, said all the tariff measures were \"fairly modest, at least relative to US moves\".",
      "He suggests that China's targeted goods represent about $20bn (\u00a316bn) worth of annual imports - around 12% of China's total imports from the US.",
      "\"This is a far cry from the more than $450bn worth of Chinese goods being targeted by the US.\"",
      "But he said China had \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the US [and domestic audiences] without inflicting too much damage\".",
      "Google probe",
      "The Chinese authorities have also announced some non-tariff measures, one of which is an anti-monopoly investigation into US tech giant Google.",
      "It is unclear what the investigation will involve, but for context, Google's search services have been blocked in China since 2010.",
      "The company still has some business presence in the country through providing apps and games to the Chinese markets by working with local developers.",
      "But China only generates about 1% of Google's global sales, which suggests if it cut ties entirely with the country, it wouldn't be much worse off.",
      "Calvin Klein added to 'unreliable entities' list",
      "China has added PVH, the American company that owns designer brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, to its so-called \"unreliable entity\" list and accused them of \"discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises\".",
      "The list, which has other US firms on it, was created in 2020 by Beijing amid the heating up of trade tensions.",
      "For Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, being on China's list will make it harder to do business in the country. They may face sanctions, including fines, and having the work visas of their foreign employees revoked.",
      "Regulators will also go to factories of the firms to investigate operations, according to Andreas Schotter, professor of international business at Western University in Ontario, Canada.",
      "The US has its own \"entity list\", which bars certain organisations from buying products from US companies without approval from Washington.",
      "\"China is hitting back in the same way President Trump is accusing Chinese companies. This is all part of the US driven de-coupling of the US and China,\" Prof Schotter added.",
      "China probes Calvin Klein over Xinjiang cotton",
      "China probes Calvin Klein over Xinjiang cotton",
      "Export controls on rare metals",
      "While tariffs have been placed on the companies wanting to import goods from abroad, China has also imposed export controls on 25 rare metals.",
      "Some of the metals are key components for many electrical products and military equipment.",
      "China has mastered the ability to refine such metals, and produced almost 90% of global refined output.",
      "The restricted list includes tungsten, which is difficult to source and a crucial material for the aerospace industry.",
      "While there are restrictions on exports, Mr Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics, said it was notable that the critical metals China imports from the US, which are used to make high-end chips, semiconductor machinery, pharmaceuticals and aerospace equipment were not targeted in any measures.",
      "The experience of previous rounds of restrictions suggests exports will drop sharply as companies scramble to get licences, a process that takes several weeks.",
      "When it comes to the impact of the restrictions, it appears the US has a plan. On Monday, Trump said he wanted Ukraine to guarantee the supply of more rare earth metals in exchange for $300bn of support in its fight against Russia."

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Are we seeing the opening moves in a wider trade war, and what are the potential economic consequences?",
    "story": [
      "Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.",
      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",
      "But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?",
      "Trump's 10% tariff on China begins as Beijing plans retaliation on US energy and some cars",
      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

    "title": "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:32:13 GMT",
    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",
      "Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:18:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Economists warn that the introduction of tariffs could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has hit the pause button - for now, at least - on imposing tariffs against imports from US neighbours Canada and Mexico.",
      "Last-minute agreements with the leaders of Mexico and Canada have suspended for a month a tit-for-tat trade war in North America.",
      "The three trade partners have deeply integrated economies and supply chains, with an estimated $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.",
      "Trump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.",
      "So what could get more expensive if Trump's tariffs do eventually go ahead?",
      "Cars",
      "Cars would probably go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "As a result of higher taxes paid on the importing of parts to build the cars, it is likely the costs will be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said Andrew Foran, an economist at TD Economics.",
      "He added \"uninterrupted free trade\" in the car-making sector had \"existed for decades\", which had led to lower prices for consumers.",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and MexicoWhat are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico",
      "What are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Beer, Tennessee whiskey and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that rather than passing on the cost increase, firms could just import less.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "It's more complex when it comes to spirits. The sector has been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They say that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. The trade bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in all three countries.",
      "Houses",
      "Imports of Canadian lumber would be hit by import tariffs to the US. Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry body has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "When it comes to the trade war with Canada, the \"most obvious\" household impact would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but that are produced using inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada.",
      "While 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.",
      "Now the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided in retaliation to any US tariffs to reduce crude oil exports, that could lead to prices rising at the petrol pumps.",
      "Avocados",
      "One food import that American consumers could see a significant price increase in is avocados. Grown primarily in Mexico due to its warm, humid climate, Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "However, if tariffs come into force, the US Agriculture Department has warned that the cost of avocados - along with popular avocado-based dishes like guacamole - could surge, especially by Super Bowl Sunday on 9 February.",
      "What about goods in Canada?",
      "Before Trump's agreement with Justin Trudeau to pause tariffs was announced on Monday, Canada had threatened retaliatory import taxes.",
      "An initial C$30bn tranche had been due to begin on Tuesday - meaning prices would have probably increased for consumers north of the border as well.",
      "Ottawa had released a list of all the US imports that would have immediately been targeted with matching 25% tariffs. They included grocery store staples, like oranges - a produce that Canada cannot grow in abundance due to its cooler climate.",
      "Alcohol originating from the US would also be harder for Canadians to find. Provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia said they would pull all American booze off their shelves starting on Tuesday.",
      "Any US alcohol - including beer and wine - that Canadians could find would likely see a price increase, as it's on the menu for retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Canadian shoppers might feel the pinch from a weaker Canadian dollar if shopping online.",

      "Failure to secure approval will see Thames edge closer to a temporary nationalisation, which could cost the government some \u00a32bn a year.",
      "The company is still considering whether to appeal against a decision by the water industry regulator Ofwat to increase bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years \u2013 short of the 53% increase it applied for.",
      "Thames Water has been struggling for some time and has been heavily criticised over its performance following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The dire state of the company's finances emerged about 18 months ago when it began a search for funding to avoid collapse.",
      "The Thames fiasco is a combination of poor historical regulation, greedy shareholders, climate change and management failure. Its debt pile is currently about \u00a317bn.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies to households will continue as normal.",
      "In the latest bid to survive, lenders have offered Thames a further loan of up to \u00a33bn in two instalments.",
      "The first payment is to get it through to the autumn, and a second is to be used if the company decides to appeal against Ofwat's 35% bill rise to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - a process that could take up to a year.",
      "The company has until 18 February to launch an appeal to the CMA.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",

      "Investment bank Rothschild is also soliciting bids to take over the company and inject much-needed funds.",
      "The court hearing on Monday is scheduled for four days with a possible extension as a much smaller group of lenders is challenging the terms of the lifeline and proposing an alternative.",
      "Although Thames will not collapse immediately if the deal is not approved by the judge, insiders have acknowledged that the company will move a step closer to temporary nationalisation \u2013 a so-called Special Administration Regime \u2013 if it fails.",
      "The government has already sounded out a number of consultancies to take that on if the situation arises.",
      "The company has been keen to stress that whatever happens, its services to 16 million customers would continue uninterrupted, but big questions about the future of Thames and other key infrastructure providers have been thrown up.",
      "Some argue that Thames should be allowed to go bust and have the government take over the company due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt, took out big dividends and paid executives handsomely. Caving in to its demands for customers to pay more now for a failing service would be a gross injustice.",
      "Others say that poor regulation has allowed this mess. Bills were kept too low for too long which hampered investment in the aging infrastructure that is now being overwhelmed by a wetter climate. Ofwat is fighting yesterday's battle and making things worse by imposing fines of tens of millions of pounds for failures, thus further depriving the company of the funds to fix the very things it is being fined for.",
      "What Thames and ministers both agree on is that neither want this sprawling company on the government's books. Consultancy Teneo has predicted a temporary nationalisation would cost up to \u00a32bn a year.",
      "However, a wider, perhaps more important argument made by some is that the failure of Thames as a private company would send an unhelpful message to the international investors that Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes will invest hundreds of billions in UK airports, wind farms, rail links and everything else on her long shopping list of growth-boosting projects.",
      "Sources close to the company and its creditors argue that we cannot agonise over and regulate for past mistakes. We are where we are - between a rock and a hard place. Carve out a special deal for Thames - or risk its collapse.",
      "Thames has just over two weeks to appeal to the CMA to bump up the bills it's allowed to charge. It's not without risk - the CMA could revise them down.",
      "Last week, the chair of the CMA was forced out by ministers unimpressed by the regulator's focus on growth. Thames says it needs higher bills to invest \u00a320bn over the next five years. It will be an interesting test case for the new chair."

    "summary": "Trump claims more taxes on trade wouldn't be a cost to the US - but almost all economists dispute this.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on goods entering the US from Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "The US president signed an executive order putting a 25% tariff - or tax on imports - on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico, to get both countries to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "Goods coming from China will also be hit with a 10% tariff \"above any additional tariffs\" until it cuts fentanyl smuggling. He has already pledged to target the country with a 60% rate, and has mulled a 200% tax on some car imports.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.",
      "During his election campaign, he told voters that the taxes were \"not going to be a cost to you, it\u2019s a cost to another country\".",
      "That was almost universally regarded by economists as misleading.",
      "Trudeau urges buyers to 'choose Canadian' as Trump tariff dispute intensifies",
      "China, Canada and Mexico vow swift response to Trump tariffs",
      "How world responds to Trump's tariffs is what matters next",
      "How do tariffs work?",
      "In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (\u00a338,000) subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge.",
      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3.1tn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.",
      "And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.",
      "The question of where the final \u201ceconomic\u201d burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated.",
      "If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden.",
      "If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.",
      "In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits.",
      "All three scenarios are theoretically possible.",
      "But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.",
      "Raising prices",
      "Let\u2019s use a concrete example.",
      "Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.",
      "Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.",
      "There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.",
      "The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.",
      "A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.",
      "The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.",
      "Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.",
      "\u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail.",
      "The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.",
      "In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.",
      "Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.",
      "And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.",
      "Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.",
      "By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",
      "It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.",
      "And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Impact on trade deficit",
      "Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.",
      "\u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said.",
      "In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.",
      "Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.",
      "Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.",
      "For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.",
      "The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.",
      "There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.",
      "Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.",
      "And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.",
      "It also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",

    "title": "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:10:01 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.",
    "story": [
      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Friends of the Earth has described the plan for a third runway as \"hugely irresponsible\".",
      "Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible, said: \"This huge increase in emissions won't help our economy, and would just encourage the small group of frequent flyers who take most of the flights.\"",
      "What about Gatwick, Luton and London's other airports?",
      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",
      "Gatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to previously published plans. Pre-covid, its record was 47 million.",
      "Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.",
      "In total these expansions could create capacity for more than 60 million extra passengers by the 2040s.",

      "The proposals would amount to a 7% reduction in the academic workforce if signed off.",

      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",

      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",
      "The changes follow a major public debate around Ofsted after a coroner ruled that an inspection contributed to the death of primary school head teacher Mrs Perry in 2023.",
      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9 passes Jay-Z in all-time Grammy nominations",
      "How the industry has been impacted",
      "Artist Manager Dani Chavez told the BBC that the fires have affected many people working in LA's music industry.",
      "\"I know multiple musicians who lost their gear\", Chavez said. \"I know stylists who work in music who lost their houses, who had costumes and whatnot. I know musicians who are born and raised in LA who lost their house.\"",
      "There is also a ripple effect in the industry on those not personally impacted by the fires.",
      "The week of events typically held before the show, which were cancelled this year to help with fundraising efforts instead, helps new musicians and allows them to break out in a crowded market - getting time with top executives and those at major record labels.",
      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",
      "\"Say you're a Best New Artist nominee who is relatively unknown to the public - being on these platforms and at these parties is a really big look if you're trying to get your music out in front of the industry. It really does help.\"",
      "One of the most sought-after parties is Spotify's event honouring the nominees for Best New Artist of the year. It is half party, half concert, with previous nominees showcasing their new music, and celebrities from all parts of the entertainment industry there to celebrate.",
      "Following the fires, Spotify chose to cancel this year's event.",
      "\"We've decided that the most impactful approach is cancelling all our Grammy Week events, including our annual Best New Artist party, and redirecting funds to support efforts to reach local fans and charitable organizations,\" Spotify's Global Head of Music Partnerships and Audience Joe Hadley wrote in an announcement.",
      "The music industry and the Grammys are deeply rooted in Los Angeles, and though the city is going through a devastating period, it has reinforced a sense of community, especially in the music industry.",
      "\"Even if people lost everything, they still have hope. And I think that feeds into what we're going to see in the music industry in the future,\" Mr Horowitz said. \"People aren't going to flee Los Angeles because of this one thing. It's not going to stop L.A. from being one of the main hubs for music in the world.\"",

      "HIGHLIGHT: Beyonc\u00e9 wins album of the year... At last",
      "Well, now we're in a pickle.",
      "On her eighth solo record, Cowboy Carter, Beyonc\u00e9 sang about the Grammys' constant, stubborn refusal to award her album of the year.",
      "\"AOTY, I ain't win,\" she sang. \"Take that s--- on the chin.\"",
      "But now she has won, for the album that contains that very lyric. Will she have to go back and re-record it? At the very least, we expect a rewrite on the tour she just announced.",
      "Joking aside, this victory was long, long overdue.",
      "In 2017, Adele even flirted with the idea of handing back her album of the year trophy, saying the music on her album, 25, couldn't compare to Beyonc\u00e9's \"monumental\u2026 beautiful and soul-baring\" Lemonade.",
      "Eyebrows were raised again in 2023, when Harry Styles' fun, but conceptually flimsy, Harry's House bested Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance \u2013 a meticulous exploration of how oppressed black and queer musicians found salvation through house music.",
      "In the end, it took Beyonc\u00e9 to approach a genre that conservative Grammy voters could understand \u2013 country \u2013 in order to secure a victory.",
      "But that's not to downplay the scale of her achievement. Cowboy Carter is a masterpiece that weaves hundreds of musical threads into a thesis about America's cultural past, and the futility of gatekeeping musical genres along racial lines.",
      "The arguments it makes are both timely and urgent, without suffocating the songs.",
      "As the second part of a planned trilogy, this surely won't be Beyonc\u00e9's last trip to the podium.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Sabrina Carpenter's stage malfunction",
      "Sabrina Carpenter has literally been practising for this moment all her life. She made her TV debut in 2011, aged 12 years old, and has been hovering on the fringes of pop superstardom pretty much ever since.",
      "So, after a huge breakthrough in 2024, she was primed and ready for the Grammy stage.",
      "Or was she?",
      "She emerged in a razzle-dazzle showgirl outfit and instantly missed her spotlight. Then she dropped the cane she was supposed to dance with. And, as she descended a grand pearlescent staircase, she suddenly disappeared through a trap door.",
      "Luckily, it was all a humorous ruse! Carpenter skipped back to the stage for a big band version of Espresso, complete with ankle-endangering tap routine.",
      "After changing into a blue, crystal-studded Victoria's Secret bodysuit, she segued effortlessly into Please, Please, Please\u2026 And then the set collapsed on her.",
      "As she leapt into the safety of a dancer's arms, she couldn't contain her laughter.",
      "It was a perfect piece of vaudeville, and the audience lapped it up. Host Trevor Noah, however, wasn't so impressed.",
      "\"That was amazing and funny, which I didn't appreciate,\" the comedian said. \"Really, Sabrina? You're just gonna take my job like that?\"",

      "Five years ago, people were stunned when The Weeknd's Blinding Lights \u2013 the most-streamed song of all time \u2013 failed to pick up a single Grammy nomination.",
      "Among those people were Abel Tesfaye \u2013 aka The Weeknd himself.",
      "He declared the awards were \"corrupt\" and criticised their lack of \"transparency\". Since then, he's refused to submit any of his music for consideration.",
      "So it was something of a coup when he gave an unannounced, unexpected performance in the middle of Sunday's ceremony.",
      "He was introduced by the Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who acknowledged the star's criticisms, and described his efforts to revamp the Grammys' electorate, by boosting the number of women and people of colour.",
      "After that, the star took to the stage with two songs from his brand new album, Cry For Me and Timeless.",
      "It was meant to be a celebration of people's ability to learn and grow, but the music was so oppressively drab \u2013 with the Weeknd constantly shrouded in smoke and shadow -  that you wondered whether he'd simply returned to sabotage the Grammys from within.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Chappell Roan rides a big pink pony",
      "BBC Sound of 2025 winner Chappell Roan cantered into the Grammys with a theatrical performance of Pink Pony Club - her love letter to LA, as well as a celebration of queer discovery.",
      "Backed by dancers dressed as rodeo clowns, Roan - herself wearing a sequinned cowboy hat and sparkly boots - rode a a giant pink carousel pony, complete with an 80s perm.",
      "\"'My Little Pony' grew up!\" joked host Trevor Noah afterwards.",
      "The performance was part of a segment that raised awareness and funds for wildfire relief.",

      "As the couple stopped to pose for cameras, the Australian model removed her black fur coat to reveal a sheer body stocking that left little to the imagination.",
      "The pair then made a swift exit, electing to skip the ceremony, driving off into the LA night.",
      "Early reports suggested they had been kicked out, but the BBC understands they left of their own accord, with one source saying that West, \"walked the carpet, got in his car and left\".",
      "They may well have been home by the time West's track Carnival lost out to Kendrick Lamar in the best rap song category.",
      "But he probably won't mind: He already has 24 Grammy awards, and now he has the headlines he craves, too.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Brat Green picks up a prize",
      "Among the three awards Charli XCX picked up was one of the night's most obscure: Best artwork.",
      "At first glance, that might seem odd. The album cover is a plain green square, with the word \"brat\" printed in a deliberately low-resolution Arial font.",
      "But the cover took five months to put together, with designer Brent David Freaney testing around 500 shades of green to produce a garish, nausea-inducing effect.",
      "Charli wanted the artwork to be deliberately off-putting \u2013 reflecting the album's dual themes of partying and self doubt. And she said it was important to challenge the convention of women dressing provocatively to promote their music.",
      "\"Why should anyone have that level of ownership over female artists?\" she asked Vogue magazine.",
      "She added: \"I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture - why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad?",
      "\"I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice.\"",
      "Towards the end of the ceremony, the star's live performance of Von Dutch and Guess saw her transform the biggest and glitziest night in music into a packed and sweaty nightclub.",
      "Emerging from a black SUV, she strutted towards the camera, throwing a glass of champagne against the wall of a parking garage, before launching into what appeared to be an underground rave.",
      "As the performance progressed, she appeared on stage with model Julia Fox and hundreds of dancers, who were then showered in underwear (a reference to the song's lyrics).",
      "The Grammys said all of the unworn garments were donated to domestic violence survivors after the show.",

      "HIGHLIGHT: This photo (2)",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's stunned reaction to winning best country album is a gif that will never stop gif-ing.",
      "LOWLIGHT (if you\u2019re Drake): Kendrick Lamar\u2019s clean sweep",
      "The Grammys have a wobbly history with hip-hop. They didn't introduce a rap category until 1989, a full decade after the Sugarhill Gang introduced the genre to a wide audience with Rapper's Delight. And no rap act has won album of the year since OutKast in 2001.",
      "So it was a rare victory when Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar won all five of the awards in which he was nominated for Not Like Us, a furious takedown of his musical rival, Drake.",
      "Among those awards were the prestigious record and song of the year - categories that have only ever recognised a rap song once before (Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019).",
      "Lamar didn't perform at the ceremony - he plays the Super Bowl halftime show next week instead - but, dressed head to toe in denim, he delivered a powerful message to Grammy voters.",
      "\"At the end of the day, nothing is more powerful than rap music. I don't care what it is. We are the culture\u2026 respect the art form\".",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Janelle Mona\u00e9's moonwalk moment",
      "Music lost one of its biggest legends in 2024, when Quincy Jones died at the age of 91.",
      "As the producer for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, the Grammys gave him a star-studded send-off that lasted almost 20 minutes.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock played a beautiful version of Fly Me To The Moon; while Stevie Wonder's sang We Are The World with choirs from two schools affected by the devastating LA fires.",
      "But it was Janelle Mona\u00e9's performance of Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough that blew the roof off.",
      "Dressed in MJ's Billie Jean outfit, she pirouetted and moonwalked and jumped on the tables as if she'd been possessed by the man himself.",
      "Towards the end of the performance, she threw off her jacket to reveal a t-shirt bearing the legend \"I Love QJ\".",
      "And guess who caught it and wore it for the rest of the night?",
      "Taylor Swift.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Snubs for Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift",
      "Even with 94 awards to consider, some people will get overlooked - but nobody expected two of the Grammys' biggest darlings to go home empty-handed.",
      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",
      "Don't count either of these artists out just yet.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Trevor Noah's easy-going hosting",
      "There's a reason they keep inviting Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys: He's got the tone right.",
      "He's relaxed, he's engaged with the music, and his humour never punches down.",
      "Here are some of his best quips from the night:",
      "\"Yesterday, Beyonce announced her new tour. Everyone saw that. I will say, though, Beyonce, there's tariffs. We can't afford a new tour, right? Maple syrup is about to be $50.\"\"Taylor Swift could become the first artist ever to win album of the year five times. Which means she would break the record of four wins, set all the way back in 2024 by Taylor Swift. I'm just gonna say Taylor, if you break Taylor's record, the Swifties are gonna come for you. And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years. So good luck to the Beatles. I think if they win, this could open up a few doors for them.\"\"And who knows, through the power of AI, one day, we could even get another Rihanna album.\"",

    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "story": [
      "Triple killer Valdo Calocane was not forced to take his anti-psychotic medication in part because he did not like needles, a major review of his NHS care has revealed.",
      "The detail was published among a catalogue of failings identified by an independent report, which revealed \"the system got it wrong\" with Calocane, who stabbed to death Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates in Nottingham in June 2023.",
      "It laid out how Calocane, who has paranoid schizophrenia, had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings - after he was discharged when he repeatedly failed to engage with them.",
      "Mr Webber's mother Emma described the report as a \"horror show\".",
      "In response, the government repeated its commitment to an inquiry into the attacks, with work ongoing to establish its scope.",
      "The NHS said it had taken the decision to publish the report in full, in line with the wishes of the families, and \"given the level of detail already in the public domain\".",
      "The independent review, by Theemis Consulting, looked into the treatment given to Calocane by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust prior to the killings, as well as the interactions the NHS had with other agencies involved in his care.",
      "The key findings of the report include:",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's careThe voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatmentOther patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"",
      "There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's care",
      "The voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatment",
      "Other patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023",
      "Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "The case, which resulted in Calocane being sentenced to a hospital order in January 2024, sparked a number of reviews including the mental health homicide review, commissioned by NHS England.",
      "Another, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is looking into both Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire Police.",
      "A review into the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocane's pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better.",
      "And in May, a judge ruled Calocane's sentence was not unduly lenient.",
      "Speaking after the release of the new report on Wednesday, Mrs Webber said: \"It's been additional trauma, horror, disbelief and fury - but all of that was anticipated and expected by all three families.\"",
      "She added: \"It leaves us feeling horrified, heartbroken, but even more determined now to make sure that it's addressed - that the government and the agencies react and listen properly.\"",
      "Mrs Webber also revealed she had been contacted by the family of one of the Southport stabbing victims.",
      "\"It's very rare that you can say to someone 'I know how dreadful that is' and know that that person really does know,\" she said.",
      "In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Coates's son James said the main focus was to keep working to make sure mistakes were not repeated.",
      "\"I know my father would be proud of me to keep fighting,\" he said.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the government had worked with NHS England to ensure the report was published in full.",
      "\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" he said. \"The findings will help to support an inquiry into this attack and we'll set out the next steps as this develops.\"",
      "He added he had called for all the recommendations made in a previous Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the case to be implemented across the country.",
      "The new report also sets out the contact Calocane had with mental health services before he killed Mr Webber, Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates, and then stole Mr Coates's van before driving it into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - all of whom were seriously injured.",
      "The report states the former University of Nottingham student first came into contact with mental health services on 24 May 2020, when he was 28, when he was arrested for criminal damage to a neighbour's flat.",
      "It was documented that Calocane's behaviour was an episode of psychosis brought on by the stress of course work and a forthcoming exam, coupled with a lack of sleep.",
      "Shortly after returning to his home, Calocane again tried to gain access to a neighbour's flat. His neighbour was so frightened that she jumped from a first-floor window, sustaining back injuries which required surgery.",
      "Calocane was then detained for the first time under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which meant he could be kept in hospital against his will for up to 28 days - known as a \"section\".",
      "Subsequent contacts with services saw him labelled as having paranoid schizophrenia.",
      "After about a month in hospital, Calocane was sent home with reviews expected from the community crisis team and the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service.",
      "He was initially called by the crisis team. The contact was a phone call rather than a face-to-face appointment \"because of Covid-19 restrictions at the time\".",
      "His family expressed concerns because they felt he could \"play down his symptoms\" over the phone.",
      "In July 2020, Calocane was admitted to hospital for a second time after forcibly entering a neighbour's flat.",
      "He was sectioned again, this time under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, which allows for a longer hospital stay of up to six months.",
      "According to medical records shared by Calocane's family with BBC Panorama, while Calocane was ill in hospital, a psychiatrist observed that \"there seems to be no insight or remorse and the danger is that this will happen again and perhaps Valdo will end up killing someone\".",
      "Two weeks after this entry was made, Calocane was discharged from Highbury Hospital.",
      "According to the report, his family \"felt this was a real missed opportunity to fully understand [Calocane's] diagnosis, risk and to get to grips with a treatment plan that [Calocane] was concordant with\".",
      "Three months before his third hospital admission in August 2021, Calocane's family again reported concerns over his mental health.",
      "At the end of August, his care co-ordinator visited him at home with a colleague, noting that he was no longer taking his medication and had no intention of continuing treatment.",
      "A month later, the report said he had \"significantly assaulted\" police officers who attended in support for a Mental Health Act assessment.",
      "On a number of occasions, his care co-ordinator had suggested the use of depot medication - which releases slowly over time meaning patients need to administer medications less frequently.",
      "But, the report said, the inpatient teams were trying to treat him \"in the least restrictive way\", and took on board his reasons for not wanting to take injectable depot medication, \"which included him not liking needles\".",
      "After multiple missed appointments, in January 2022, officials contemplated discharging Calocane from the EIP service due to a lack of engagement.",
      "But the following day, the EIP learned Calocane had trapped two housemates in their flat, which resulted in the police being called.",
      "He was assessed under the Mental Health Act, but not detained.",
      "Calocane was admitted to hospital at the end of January 2022 for almost a month - his fourth hospital admission.",
      "After being discharged, it was noted that none of Calocane's care providers should visit him at home alone because of his \"history of violence and aggression\".",
      "Calocane then missed a few appointments to collect his medication over the coming months, and a new care co-ordinator tried to contact him multiple times.",
      "After these failed attempts, a decision was taken in September 2022 to discharge Calocane from the EIP service to his GP.",
      "The report said \"opportunities to assertively try to reach out to [Calocane] when he disengaged from services were limited\" because of pressures in the team.",
      "\"Due to multiple factors, including workload, the discharge system did not function as intended,\" the report said.",
      "'Watershed moment'",
      "It added there was no contact between Calocane and mental health services, or his GP, for roughly nine months from this time until the killings.",
      "Dr Jessica Sokolov, regional medical director at NHS England (Midlands), said it was \"clear the system got it wrong\" and apologised to the victims \"on behalf of the NHS and the organisations involved\" in Calocane's care.",
      "Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said the organisation had asked every mental health trust to review the report findings.",
      "Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, said the publication of the review \"should act as a watershed moment revealing the truth and honouring the needs of the families of victims of homicides by people with mental illness or disorder\".",
      "In a statement, Calocane's family said they were \"deeply sorry\" for \"this horrific tragedy\".",
      "They said: \"The report confirms what we and many others have known for a while: the mental healthcare system is in crisis and in need of immediate intervention, which we believe must come from the government. It is not enough to say that the NHS failed; we must be honest in recognising that the NHS has been set up for failure, and cannot be left to fix itself on its own.\"",
      "The chief executive of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Ifti Majid, added: \"We apologise unreservedly for the opportunities we missed in the care of Valdo Calocane and accept the Theemis report in its entirety including its findings and recommendations.",
      "\"We are making clear progress with a trust-wide plan, which is already delivering key improvements in areas such as risk assessment and discharge processes.\"",

    "story": [
      "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.",
      "Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.",
      "BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).",
      "One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.",
      "Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.",
      "Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.",
      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",
      "We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.",
      "Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.",
      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",
      "It said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".",
      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",
      "We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.",
      "\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.",
      "The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.",

      "Chairman Dr Shoo Lee told a press conference \"in all cases death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care\".",
      "Letby, who is serving 15 whole life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between 2015 and 2016, has already lost two bids to appeal against her convictions.",
      "The panel's findings are likely to form part of an application which has been made by her lawyers to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for her case to be investigated as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The lengthy and medically technical press conference was organised by Letby's legal team who had said the panel would present \"significant new medical evidence\".",
      "Dr Lee, a Canadian neonatal care expert, said there were alternative explanations for each of Letby's convictions for murder or attempted murder.",
      "He said he became involved in the case after learning that an academic paper he co-authored on air embolism, one of the methods Letby was said to have used to attack babies, had formed part of the prosecution case in her trial.",
      "Dr Lee said the 14 experts, including medical professionals from Canada, the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and the UK, had looked at 17 cases at the heart of Letby's prosecution and had compiled an \"impartial evidence-based report\".",
      "The report presented at the conference was a summary of the panel's findings, and the full report would be submitted to Letby's legal team, Dr Lee said.",
      "Dr Lee provided what he said were highly detailed grounds baby-by-baby for concluding that none of the murders occurred.",
      "He added: \"We did not find any murders. In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.\"",
      "\"Lucy was charged with seven murders and seven attempted murders\", he said.",
      "\"In our opinion, the medical opinion, the medical evidence doesn't support murder in any of these babies.",
      "\"Our full report will go to Lucy's barrister later this month, and then it'll be up to him and the courts to decide what next to do.\"",
      "During Letby's trial, the prosecution referred to the 1989 paper by Dr Lee that looked at cases of air embolus, referring to injuries caused when air is injected into a baby's arteries or veins after staff at the Countess of Chester reported skin discoloration on some of the babies.",
      "In the cases Dr Lee analysed in his paper, those injuries had happened accidentally.",
      "The prosecution argued that one of the methods Letby used to injure or kill babies was to inject air into their veins and used Dr Lee's paper to back that claim.",
      "In the paper, Dr Lee described a distinct discoloration on the babies' skin in 10% of cases.",
      "'Scrutinised'",
      "However, at the press conference Dr Lee said in all of the cases in his paper air was injected into the babies' arteries, not their veins.",
      "He said that the skin discolouration described in the paper was not possible when air was injected into the veins.",
      "Dr Lee said he had recently updated his academic paper and found no cases of skin discolouration linked to air embolism by the venous system.",
      "He prefaced his remarks by saying that the thoughts of each panel member were with the families of the babies who had died.",
      "Former neonatal nurse Letby, now 35, lost two bids to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal last year.",
      "The prosecution's medical case was scrutinised by the Court of Appeal in May last year and found to be safe - and the judges noted Letby herself did not present any experts at her trial offering an alternative view.",
      "Dr Lee had offered to give evidence to the Court of Appeal as part of Letby's application for permission to appeal, but three senior judges said his conclusions did not undermine her convictions.",
      "The judges concluded there had been no prosecution expert evidence diagnosing air embolus solely on the basis of skin discolouration.",
      "Earlier, the CCRC said Letby's lawyers had applied to the commission to investigate her case as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The body said it would now assess the application and determine whether there was new evidence which presented a reasonable chance of a conviction being overturned.",
      "A CCRC spokesperson said: \"We are aware that there has been a great deal of speculation and commentary surrounding Lucy Letby's case, much of it from parties with only a partial view of the evidence.",
      "\"We ask that everyone remembers the families affected by events at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.\"",
      "Mark McDonald, Letby's barrister, said that because her previous legal team had not called a medical expert at her trial, the information presented was \"new, fresh evidence\".",
      "He said the nurse was convicted because of the medical evidence, and if that was wrong any circumstantial evidence would \"fall away\".",
      "\"The most important thing, the reason why Lucy Letby was convicted, was because of the medical evidence that was presented to the jury that today has been demolished,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease, with a price tag of \u00a31.65m, is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England.",
      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",

      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",

      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",

      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",

      "Other trials suggest Mounjaro users might lose even more - up to 20%. But it is difficult to compare the two treatments and, crucially, users of either drug can put weight back on once they stop treatment",

      "But \"it was over before I knew\", she says.",
      "Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton.",
      "\"It was nothing,\" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. \"I couldn't feel anything.\" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.",

      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",

      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

      "Speaking to Parliament, Rayner said the postponement would pave the way for a \"generational power shift from Whitehall to the town hall\".",
      "She said that holding elections for authorities that were due to be scrapped would be \"an expensive and irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "However, Conservative shadow minister Kevin Hollinrake said the \"mass postponement\" was a \"worrying day for democracy\".",

      "He added: \"These are for her to use as a pawn to implement this government's deeply unpopular socialist agenda.\"",
      "In addition to merging councils, the government has also said it wants more places in England to have mayors, who would get powers over areas such as housing and transport.",

      "\"These places will get a fast-track ticket to drive real change in their area,\" she told MPs.",
      "\"While devolution can sound techie, the outcome is simple - it's a plan for putting more money in people's pockets, it's a plan for quicker, better, cheaper transport designed with local people in mind, a plan for putting politics back in the service.\"",

      "In January, the government said that of the 21 county councils due to hold elections, 16 had requested postponements. Two of the 10 unitary councils had also made the same request.",
      "On Wednesday, Rayner told MPs she had only agreed to half of the requests for postponements made by local authorities, and that delaying elections to allow for restructuring was a \"well established precedent\".",
      "\"After careful consideration, I've only agreed to postpone elections in places where this is central to our manifesto promise to deliver devolution,\" she said.",

      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump's view would \"inform the negotiations\", which began under the previous Tory government.",
      "Meanwhile, Ramgoolam said it would be \"better that Trump has a look at the agreement\" so the US president can see if it \"is good or not\".",
      "There had been efforts to get the deal signed before Trump's inauguration on 20 January. However, the UK changed course, saying it was \"perfectly reasonable for the US administration to consider the detail\" of any agreement.",

    "story": [
      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",
      "He said the idea of a grey belt had initially \"intrigued\" committee members who believed it could \"make a positive contribution\" to meeting housing targets.",
      "Some councils ordered to increase home building by 400%, new BBC tracker shows",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Housing plans not war on rural England, says minister",
      "What is the 'grey belt' and how many homes could Labour build on it?",
      "However, he said that changes announced in the National Planning and Policy Framework (NPPF) would mean that the impact of the grey belt would be \"at best, marginal\".",
      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",
      "\"In the realm of decision-taking they are already playing a key role in the outcome of appeals where green belt land is considered by inspectors to be grey belt.",
      "\"We have seen more than a handful of successful appeals in the eight weeks since the grey belt concept was confirmed in the NPPF.\""

      "Over the weekend, Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico - which have both since been paused - and said he would take similar action against the EU but suggested a deal could be \"worked out\" with the UK.",
      "Asked if he would be willing to water down attempts to forge closer ties with the EU in exchange for keeping the US on side, Sir Keir said both relationships were important to the UK.",
      "\"Now, that for me isn't new, I think that's always been the case and will be the case for many, many years to come,\" he added.",
      "The prime minister told a press conference in Brussels it was \"early days\" when it came to tariff talks with the US and that he backed \"open and strong trading relations\".",
      "Sir Keir was in Belgium to meet Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and attend talks with EU leaders - the first PM to do so since Brexit.",
      "Asked about tensions between the US and the EU, Rutte said there were \"always issues between allies\" but that would \"not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrent strong\".",
      "On Ukraine, he said Nato - the military alliance of Western countries - had to \"not only sustain but continue to step up our support\" to ensure Ukraine could negotiate with Russia from \"a position of strength\".",
      "He added that spending 2% of national income on defence was \"not enough to keep us safe\" and that there was \"no time to waste\" in boosting funding.",
      "Currently Nato asks every member country to spend a least 2% of GDP on defence, however it is thought only 23 of the 32 members meet the target.",
      "Sir Keir said the UK currently spends 2.3% and that his government would shortly be setting out \"the path\" towards reaching 2.5%.",
      "Speaking at a European Council dinner, the prime minister called for more military collaboration between the UK and Europe including by improving military mobility and logistics across Europe, focusing on research and development and deepening industrial collaboration.",
      "He also said there should be more co-operation to protect against state threats and sabotage, including on subsea infrastructure. This comes after the UK issued a warning to Russia last month after a spy ship was spotted near undersea cables.",
      "While defence is the focus of his Brussels trip, for Sir Keir it is also part of an ongoing bid to \"reset\" UK-EU relations.",
      "The UK government wants to forge stronger links with the EU - but that could anger the US and risk the UK getting caught up in a trade war.",
      "Similarly, the EU might object to Sir Keir siding with the US rather than its European neighbours.",
      "Earlier, No 10 said the prime minister trusted Trump and pointed to \"a really constructive early set of conversations\" between the two men.",
      "\"We've got a fair and balanced trading relationship which benefits both sides of the Atlantic,\" the spokesman added.",
      "\"It's worth around \u00a3300bn and we are each other's single largest investors, with \u00a31.2tn invested in each other's economies.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage the prime minister's commitment to industrial collaboration with the EU showed he was \"a rejoiner at heart\".",
      "The UK should be negotiating a free trade deal with the US instead, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, claiming the EU was \"diminishing every year\".",
      "\"If we start to tie ourselves to industrial collaboration, as it appears was agreed last night, then we find ourselves with less flexibility in doing deals with countries like America.",
      "\"My fear is we tie ourselves to EU law.\"",
      "What are tariffs, which countries is Trump targeting and will prices rise?",
      "Trump says US tariffs on EU will happen, but tells BBC a UK deal 'could be worked out'",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "Following Trump's tariffs announcements over the weekend, European and Asian stock markets fell, with car manufacturers particularly badly hit.",
      "The UK was also impacted but to a lesser extent than the EU.",
      "Analysis produced last year by the University of Sussex suggested the UK could face a \u00a322bn hit to exports if the US imposed a blanket 20% tariff on all imports.",
      "Trump believes imposing tariffs will help grow the US economy and protect jobs, however it could lead to consumers paying more as prices adjust to the taxes.",
      "On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the imposition of the 25% tariffs had been delayed after reaching an agreement with the US which would see her country deploy 10,000 troops to tackle drug trafficking into the US.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also confirmed that Trump's proposed tariffs of 25% on Canadian goods would be \"paused for at least 30 days while we work together\".",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU wanted a constructive dialogue with the US but was ready to respond firmly if it was \"unfairly\" targeted by the new Trump administration.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said that if EU interests were attacked, the trading bloc would have to \"make itself respected and thus react\".",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said there were \"no winners in trade wars\", but if there was a trade war with the US \"then the one laughing on the side is China\".",
      "Asked earlier if he would put tariffs on the UK, Tump said: \"UK is out of line but I'm sure that one... I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "He added his discussions with the British prime minister had \"been very nice\" adding: \"We've had a couple of meetings. We've had numerous phone calls. We're getting along very well.\"",
      "As well as defence the UK wants to discuss easing restrictions on the trade of food and animal products and co-operation on emission trading schemes with the EU.",
      "The mutual recognition of professional qualifications and allowing touring musicians to travel more easily are also areas of interest.",
      "The EU is keen to set up a youth mobility scheme, which would make it easier for young EU citizens to study and work in the UK and vice versa. However, ministers have so far rejected the idea.",
      "Downing Street has not ruled out joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention, which would allow tariff-free trade on some goods.",
      "The Conservatives have accused the government of \"trying to reopen the divisions of the past and edge us back into the EU\".",
      "In contrast, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has been urging the government to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union, allowing tariff-free trade between the two sides.",
      "Following the tariff announcements, Sir Ed said the US president was \"acting like a playground bully\" and the UK should \"work with our allies in the Commonwealth and Europe to stand strong against Trump\".",

    "story": [
      "The government will step in more quickly to help struggling schools based on the findings of new Ofsted report cards, the education secretary has said.",
      "Bridget Phillipson said in a speech on Monday that the old single-word Ofsted judgements, which were scrapped last year, were \"too blunt\" and \"too vague\" to serve a purpose.",
      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",
      "However, the report cards have drawn strong criticism from school leaders, who said the proposals risk \"replicating the worst aspects of the current system\".",
      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",
      "The changes follow a major public debate around Ofsted after a coroner ruled that an inspection contributed to the death of primary school head teacher Mrs Perry in 2023.",
      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",
      "Those schools which do not improve will be transferred to a successful academy trust, even if they are already run by a different academy or a council.",
      "Under Ofsted's proposals, the old one or two-word judgements, ranging across four grades from \"Outstanding\" to \"Inadequate\", will be replaced from the 2025 autumn term by a report card describing what inspectors have found on key aspects of each school, including:",
      "Quality of educationBehaviour and attendancePersonal developmentLeadership and management",
      "Quality of education",
      "Behaviour and attendance",
      "Personal development",
      "Leadership and management",
      "There will be five possible grades for each area, which are also one or two words in length: \"causing concern\", \"attention needed\", \"secure\", \"strong\" and \"exemplary\".",

      "A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met.",
      "The new format will be used for inspections across all settings, from early years to further education colleges, but will be tailored to the type of provider, Ofsted said.",
      "Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver said the proposals were designed to \"raise standards and improve the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged\".",
      "He said the \"suite of grades\" would give parents \"much more detail\" and help identify a school's strengths and areas for improvement.",
      "However, school leaders' unions said the new system would add \"enormous pressure\" to schools, and could \"worsen an already severe recruitment and retention crisis\" in teaching.",
      "Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the plans would generate a \"new league table based on the sum of Ofsted judgements across at least 40 points of comparison\".",
      "It would be \"bewildering for teachers and leaders, never mind the parents whose choices these reports are supposedly intended to guide\", he added.",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the plans would \"do little to reduce the enormous pressure school leaders are under\".",
      "Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the five-point grading scale \"maintains the current blunt, reductive approach that cannot capture the complexity of school life nor provide more meaningful information to parents\".",
      "As well as criticism over its single-word judgements, Sir Martyn has also previously said Ofsted's inspection process should be \"far more empathetic\".",
      "Those comments came in the wake of the inquest into Ruth Perry's death, in which the coroner said the inspection at her school had \"lacked fairness, respect and sensitivity\" and was at times \"rude and intimidating\".",
      "Ofsted removed its practice of issuing overall grades for a school at the start of the current academic year, bringing in a temporary system of grading individual aspects of a school's performance, ahead of the introduction of report cards later this year.",
      "Wirral head teacher Stuart Mycroft had his school, Castleway Primary, inspected under the current system in the autumn term.",
      "He told the BBC he was not convinced that Ofsted had truly changed.",

      "He said the inspection process had been confrontational and unpleasant.",
      "\"The impact emotionally was huge,\" he said. \"I was absolutely exhausted.\"",

      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",

      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse.

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",

      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",

      "Morgan McSweeney emphasised that whatever their faction, Labour members shared certain core principles - and top of the list was a commitment to combatting poverty and defending the welfare state.",
      "That is why any Labour politician treads carefully when looking at welfare reform.",
      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",
      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",
      "\"Lots of people tell us they're scared to go to work in case it doesn't work out and they then can't go back to the safety net,\" a senior government source said.",

      "DWP must focus on work not welfare, says minister",
      "Some in government say this may need more frequent assessments of claimants' health, but those involved in discussions acknowledge that being required to explain their condition to the DWP can often be \"traumatic\", \"humiliating\" and \"terrifying\" for vulnerable claimants.",
      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",
      "And then there's the politics.",
      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",

      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",

      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",

Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",
      "Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify the amount of time EU citizens can spend in the UK, visa free.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "summary": "The chancellor announced a range of reforms on Wednesday - including a new runway for Heathrow airport.",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as she unveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.",
      "But how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?",
      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",

      "Pension shake-up plan aims to boost growth",
      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",
      "Measuring the size of the surplus of defined benefit scheme depends on various complex assumptions about the scheme and its relationship to the employer.",
      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",
      "But the size of any boost from this pension reform would depend on companies being willing to invest their surpluses, which is subject to great uncertainty as many firms have been looking to offload their defined benefit pension schemes to insurance companies in recent years.",

    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "Last year, a Vesuvius Challenge team managed to read about 5% of another Herculaneum scroll.",
      "Its subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.",
      "The Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.",
      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

      "\"They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk.\"",
      "Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:45:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",

      "Essex turkey farmer Paul Kelly, whose business was hit hard in the worst avian flu outbreak from 2021 to 2023, told the BBC that \"the foot has been taken off the gas\" when it comes to making poultry vaccines available to UK farmers.",

      "He added that the organisation was a \"huge supporter\" of vaccination for poultry but recognised there were challenges, including the cost to farmers and the impact on trade with other countries that prohibit imports from producers that vaccinate.",
      "Meanwhile, there have also been some scientific questions raised about bird flu vaccinations.",
      "Recent work by researchers from the UK's Royal Veterinary College and institutions in China found possible evidence that they may be linked to changes in how the virus evolves.",
      "They carried out genetic analysis of avian flu samples collected from wild birds and farmed poultry between 1996 and 2023.",
      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",
      "They said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.",

      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",

      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",

      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "It is rare that a video game series becomes so popular it inspires copycats - but it is rarer still that it's so unique it kicks off its own genre.",
      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",
      "And with that new power comes a new game - after seven years in the wilderness, publisher Koei Tecmo is back with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.",
      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",
      "He said Dynasty Warriors' future was about \"getting the most\" out of current consoles - perhaps with even more enemies on screen.",
      "Though he laughed off the suggestion that perhaps the studio should consider collaborating on the ultimate \"spin-off\" - a Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",
      "And Mr Sho said if he could make any Dynasty Warriors spin-off, there are two series he's huge fans of - Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",

We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",

I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",

      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",

      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",

      "Four new laws will tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the government has announced.",
      "The Home Office says the UK will be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.",
      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",

      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",

      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",

      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",

      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",

      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",

      "Trump's vague proposal could signal the largest shift in US policy on the Middle East in decades, upending widespread international consensus on the need for a Palestinian state - comprised of Gaza and the occupied West Bank - to exist alongside Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the idea was \"worth paying attention to\" but it has been roundly rejected by Arab nations and some US allies.",
      "Why did Donald Trump say this now?",
      "If Donald Trump is right about one thing, it is that decades of US diplomacy on Israel and the Palestinians have failed to resolve the conflict.",
      "Peace proposals and presidents have come and gone but the problems have festered. Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the war in Gaza it triggered were the hideous results.",
      "Trump made his millions as a property developer and, with that hat on, made a perfectly valid observation: if Gaza is to be rebuilt, from scratch in some places, it makes little sense for hundreds of thousands of civilians to be sheltering in the rubble.",
      "The task of rebuilding Gaza will be monumental. Unexploded munitions and mountains of debris have to be removed. Water and power lines have to be repaired. Schools, hospitals and shops need to be rebuilt.",
      "Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has said that could take years - and while that goes on, the Palestinians will need to go somewhere.",
      "However, rather than exploring ways of keeping them close to home, almost certainly in camps in the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, Trump says they should be encouraged to leave - permanently.",
      "Trump believes that in their absence, an idyllic, American-owned \"Riviera of the Middle East\" will rise from the ashes, providing thousands of jobs, opportunities for investment and, ultimately, a place for \"the world's people to live\".",
      "Why are Trump's comments so controversial?",
      "Where to begin?",
      "Even for a president who spent much of his first term upending US Middle East policy \u2013 including moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights \u2013 this was an astonishing proposal.",

      "To be clear, to do this by force would be a grave violation of international law.",
      "Some Palestinians would likely choose to leave Gaza and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Since October 2023, as many as 150,000 already have.",
      "But others cannot or will not, either because they lack the financial means to do so or because their attachment to Gaza \u2013 part of the land they call Palestine \u2013 is simply too strong.",
      "Many Gazans are ancestors of people who fled or were driven from their homes in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel - a period Palestinians call the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe.",
      "The thought of another will be too painful for many and they will cling to their reduced lives in what remains of Gaza with a fierce determination.",
      "For Palestinians who dream of a state of their own, alongside Israel, the loss of part of it will feel like an amputation.",
      "Gaza has been physically separated from the West Bank since 1948. Previous rounds of negotiations, as well as Trump's 2020 \"Vision for Peace\", included plans for tunnels or railways that might link the two.",
      "Now Trump is basically telling the Palestinians to give up on Gaza once and for all.",
      "While he does not appear to be advocating the forced deportation of civilians - which is against international law - Trump is clearly encouraging Palestinians to leave.",
      "Palestinian officials have already accused Israel of blocking the supply of tens of thousands of caravans which could help Gazans to stay put in less damaged parts of the territory while reconstruction takes place elsewhere.",
      "The Arab countries who Trump says should accept as many as 1.8 million Gazan refugees, mainly Egypt and Jordan, have expressed outrage.",
      "Both have enough problems of their own without this added burden.",
      "What is the current status of Gaza?",
      "Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years before it was seized by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War.",
      "It is still considered occupied by Israel under international law, which Israel disputes. It says the occupation ended in 2005, when it unilaterally dismantled Jewish settlements and pulled out its military.",
      "Around three quarters of UN members recognise Gaza as part of a sovereign state of Palestine, though the US does not.",
      "Cut off from the outside world by fences and an Israeli maritime blockade, it has never felt like a truly independent place.",
      "Nothing and no one moves in or out without Israel's permission, and an international airport - opened amid much fanfare in 1998 - was destroyed by Israel in 2001 during the second Palestinian uprising.",
      "Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza, citing security reasons, after Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.",

      "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained",
      "Could Trump take over Gaza if he wants to?",
      "It goes without saying that the US has no legal claim to the territory and it is not at all clear how Trump intends to impose American rule.",
      "As with his bullish claims about US control over Greenland or the Panama Canal, it is not yet clear whether Trump really means it or if the comments represent an opening, outlandish bargaining position ahead of a bruising set of negotiations on Gaza's future.",
      "Various plans have been discussed for the post-war governance of Gaza.",
      "In December, the two main Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, agreed to form a joint committee to oversee its administration - an agreement which has so far come to nothing.",
      "At other times, discussions have focused on the creation of an international peacekeeping force, possibly made up of troops from Arab countries.",
      "Last month, Reuters reported that the UAE, US and Israel had discussed the formation of a temporary administration in Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA), which already has control in parts of the West Bank, was ready to take over.",
      "However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously publicly insisted that the PA will have no role to play in running post-war Gaza.",
      "In a limited sense, American boots are already on the ground. A US security firm has employed around 100 former US special forces to man a vital checkpoint south of Gaza City and screen the vehicles of Palestinians returning to the north for weapons.",
      "Egyptian security personnel have also been seen at the same checkpoint.",
      "These could be the first, tentative signs of an expanded international - and possibly US-led - presence in Gaza.",
      "But that is hardly a US takeover, something that would require a large-scale military intervention in the Middle East - the sort of thing Trump has long told voters he wants to avoid.",
      "Could there be implications for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire?",
      "Negotiations on phase two of the two-week-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have barely begun but it is hard to see how Trump's bombshell remarks will help to advance them.",
      "If Hamas feels the end product of this whole process is a depopulated Gaza - devoid not just of Hamas, but of all Palestinians - it may conclude there is nothing to talk about and hold on to the remaining hostages it took on 7 October 2023.",
      "Netanyahu's critics have accused him of looking for excuses to blow up the negotiations and resume the war. They are bound to conclude that, with these comments, Trump is a willing accomplice.",
      "On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister's right-wing backers have expressed satisfaction with the US takeover plan, potentially reducing the risk of cabinet resignations and making Netanyahu's immediate political future appear more assured.",
      "In that sense, Trump has given Netanyahu a powerful incentive to keep the ceasefire going.",
      "What did Donald Trump say about the West Bank?",
      "Asked whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would have an announcement to make in four weeks' time.",
      "That remark has caused alarm among Palestinians, for whom such an announcement would inevitably be seen as another nail in the coffin for a two-state solution.",
      "Recognising the legitimacy of Israel's settlements in the West Bank would be a hugely consequential move. Most of the rest of the world regards them as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.",
      "During previous rounds of peace talks, negotiators recognised that Israel would get to hold onto large settlement blocs as part of a final agreement, probably in exchange for small chunks of Israeli territory.",
      "In 2020, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords, which secured the historic normalisation of relations between Israel and two Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.",
      "The UAE signed that agreement on the understanding Israel would not annex parts of the West Bank - an understanding which may now be in jeopardy.",

      "What were the suspect's motives?",

      "\"Factors that could lead to a country being classified as uncooperative include hindering ICE's removal efforts by refusing to conduct consular interviews when necessary; refusing to accept charter removal missions; having an unacceptable ratio of releases when compared to removals and/or unacceptable average time from executable final order of removal to removal; and/or denying or delaying issuance of travel documents, such as passports,\" the document says.",
      "India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said recently that India was \"firmly opposed to illegal migration, especially as it is linked to other forms of organised crime\".",

      "As he prepares to set off on another rescue mission on Ukraine's eastern front, 35-year-old Anton Yaremchuk is grateful for the fog. It will shield him and his colleague Pylyp from Russian drones hunting from the skies. His armoured van will provide more protection \u2013 but only up to a point. Every journey could be the last.",
      "In December shrapnel from a drone attack ripped through a clearly marked armoured vehicle used by his team, causing injuries but no deaths.",
      "\"We were extremely lucky,\" he says.",
      "Anton's regular destination these days is the industrial city of Pokrovsk, which he says is \"being attacked night and day\".",
      "Russian forces are closing in \u2013 they are now less than 2km (1.2 miles) away.",
      "\"The last few days we were coming in, there was hell,\" Anton tells us. \"There are around 7,000 people still there. We'll try to get some people out of that nightmare.\"",
      "He's been doing just that since Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "With his country under attack, the Ukrainian cinematographer left his life and career in Berlin, came home and co-founded a small aid organisation, Base UA. Since then, he and his team have managed to get about 3,000 civilians out of harm's way, taking them away from front lines to safer areas.",
      "Pokrovsk used to be one of those places.",
      "\"It's crazy,\" he says as we head for the city, \"because this used to be the haven, the safest city in the region and the biggest hospital. The evacuation train was departing from Pokrovsk.\"",
      "If and when Russian forces take the city, it will deprive the Ukrainian military of a key supply and transport hub.",
      "Ukraine has already lost the output from a crucial coal mine in the area \u2013 the only one producing coking coal for its steel industry. Operations were suspended last month because of the Russian advance.",
      "We join Anton for the journey to Pokrovsk. He has a tourniquet, and a separate medical kit attached to the front of his body armour. His white high-visibility jacket bears the slogan \"leave no-one behind\".",
      "Before we set off, there's a warning. \"When we park, get out of the vehicles and don't stand nearby,\" Anton tells us, \"in case they are targeted.\"",
      "The closer we get the more explosions we hear. War has left its mark, draining the city of life. Streets are deserted, and houses boarded up. Some buildings have been flattened. There's no smoke from the chimneys on snow-capped rooves. We pass a parked car with a white flag.",
      "But we find Olga, already waiting by the roadside, wrapped up in a lilac winter coat and furry hood. She's one of six people on Anton's list for evacuation this time.",
      "She goes to lock up her home - moving quickly despite her 71 years. And then she gets into the van and does not look back.",
      "\"I have been in this house for 65 years,\" Olga says.",
      "\"It's hard to leave everything behind. But it's not life any more, it's like hell. In the beginning we thought maybe we will sit it out, but now the ground is shaking.\"",
      "Her children and grandchildren have already fled the bombing. I ask if she thinks she will be able to come back one day. \"Who knows,\" she replies, \"but we hope.\"",
      "Along the way, whenever Anton spots people out on the street \u2013 and there aren't many - he urges them to go. He stops the car to hand out leaflets explaining that evacuation is free, and help, including a place to stay and ongoing payments, is available in the city of Pavlohrad to the west. But some are hard to persuade.",
      "\"I have to stay,\" one elderly woman says. \"My son has died, and I need to be near his grave.\"",
      "\"I don't think he would want this,\" Anton says.",
      "We drive on and pass a group of three who have been out collecting water. Anton shouts another warning. \"There will be street battles,\" he says, \"unfortunately, I promise you this. I am doing this from the very first day. It's the same everywhere. This is the final stage.\"",
      "One of the women comes forward to take a leaflet. \"God keep you safe,\" she tells him before going on her way.",
      "Anton moves fast from address to address. When there's no answer at one house, he climbs over a high metal gate to investigate. He knocks. He shouts. He speaks to a neighbour. With no sign of the woman he hoped to evacuate, we drive on.",
      "I ask what he's expecting for 2025, now President Trump is back in the White House and pushing for peace talks.",
      "\"I stopped looking too much ahead,\" he says. \"I think nobody really knows what's going to happen. I personally don't think that even if some kind of negotiations will start, they will bring a ceasefire anytime soon.\"",
      "More than this he expects fighting will worsen if talks do start, as both sides will try to gain leverage.",
      "The last pick up of the day is 75-year-old Lyuba \u2013 her white hair peeping out from under a scarf. Her long life is now compressed into a few plastic bags. She looks bereft and flinches at every explosion we hear.",
      "\"It has been bad,\" she tells me. \"Bad. We were left alone. There are no authorities. People are just getting killed under the sky,\" she says, gesturing upwards. \"There's no gas, no water, no electricity.\"",
      "Lyuba is helped into the van, which is now full, with five elderly evacuees \u2013 their memories and their fears - and one black cat peering out from a pet carrier. No-one speaks.",
      "For Anton this is a familiar picture, but still a painful one.",
      "We first travelled with him in the heat of summer in 2022. He was then evacuating civilians from another front-line city \u2013 Lysychansk - as Russian shells rained down.",
      "Now in Ukraine's third winter of war he \u2013 and other volunteers \u2013 are still trying to outrun moving front lines and save whoever they can.",
      "\"To be honest every time I see this I break down,\" he says, \"because it's just these innocent people leaving everything behind. These are human tragedies, and you can never really get used to it. But I am glad that we manage to get people out to safety.\"",
      "That comes at a cost, and it is increasing.",
      "Since we travelled to Pokrovsk, one of Anton's teams has come under fire from a Russian drone. A 28-year-old British volunteer lost an arm and a leg \u2013 saving civilians - but is now stable in hospital.",
      "Following the attack, Anton's group have suspended evacuations from Pokrovsk, and from other front-line areas.",
      "A Ukrainian police unit called the White Angels is still doing rescue missions in the city. They tell us they are \"trying to be very cautious and careful\".",
      "Inside the city, in freezing basements and unlit homes, the remaining residents \u2013 mostly elderly \u2013 are at the mercy of Russian glide bombs and artillery, as they wait for Pokrovsk to fall.",

      "He later said, in a briefing with journalists, that South Africa's \"leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things\".",

    "story": [
      "The Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Acsa) has apologised for failing to protect the public from the risk posed by a prolific British child abuser who had moved to South African in 2001.",
      "Senior barrister John Smyth, who died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77,  abused over 100 children and young men in the UK and Zimbabwe in the 1970s and 1980s. He met many of them at Christian camps that he organised.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, resigned last year following the publication of an independent review into the matter.",
      "It found that Mr Welby and other church leaders \"could and should\" have formally reported Smyth in 2013 to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa.",
      "Smyth moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984, two years after a report, which was not made public at the time, detailed the physical abuse he meted out.",
      "His 2001 move to South Africa came after an investigation into his activities in Zimbabwe, the findings of which were not widely circulated.",
      "A fresh enquiry commissioned last year by Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba found that while no similar cases of abuse were \"ascertainable on record\" in South Africa, \"there was a very high risk that they could have happened\".",
      "The independent report found that while the Church had no prior warnings of Smyth's abuses until 2013, its \"further communication of that warning within Acsa between 2013 and Smyth's death in 2018... fell short\".",

      "It says that Smyth joined an Anglican community in Durban, where he occasionally preached and was part of a team running confirmation classes that exposed him to young children.",
      "He and his wife Anne \"abruptly\" left that community at some point in 2003 or 2004 after the church's leaders confronted Smyth with information about his abusive behaviour, the report says.",
      "The couple then moved to Cape Town and joined another Anglican community.",
      "In August 2013, the \"first warning to Acsa\" on Smyth's behaviour was sent to Bishop Garth Counsell by the Diocese of Ely in the UK and by the end of the year, the couple left the Anglican Church for a different Christian community, Church-on-Main. They would later return to an Anglican church just shortly before Smyth's death.",
      "And while another bishop, Peter Lee, had also \"heard informally\" about the abuses prior to his arrival in South Africa in 1976, the report found that neither clergyman were \"remiss in any duty to pass on what had reached them regarding Smyth\".",
      "\"But... [they] erred in failing to inform the authorities at Church-on-Main of what they had learned about Smyth from the letter received from the Diocese of Ely.\"",
      "The report says that though there were no allegations of Smyth continuing his abusive behaviour in South Africa \"what... is evident... is that from 2001 on, young members of Acsa were exposed to the real risk of Smyth perpetrating in South Africa the serial abuse documented in the UK and Zimbabwe\".",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Archbishop Makgoba acknowledged the Church's failure to protect its congregants and \"wider community\" from Smyth's potential abuse.",

    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",

      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

      "They and their descendants make up the vast majority of Gaza's population to this day.",
      "Trump's proposals, if enacted, would involve that population, now more than two million people, being forced elsewhere in the Arab world or even beyond, says Trump, to \"resettle\u2026 permanently\".",
      "The proposals would wipe out the possibility of a future two-state solution in any conventional sense and will be categorically rejected by Palestinians and the Arab world as an expulsion plan.",
      "Much of Netanyahu's political base and the ultranationalist settler movement in Israel will champion President Trump's words, seeing them as the fulfilment of a means as Netanyahu puts it to stop \"Gaza being a threat to Israel\".",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

      "A pre-emptive move designed to further smoothen the entry of Harley Davidsons into India \u2013 and, Delhi hopes, ward off any threat of tariffs. US motorcycle exports to India were worth $3m last year.",
      "Donald Trump has marked his return to the White House by brandishing trade measures against America's neighbours and allies as well as its big rival China.",
      "India hopes it is ahead of the game \u2013 but will its tariff cuts satisfy Trump, or is trade action still on the table?",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are literally two arms of the US. If he has acted against them, he could easily act against India too,\" says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "In their phone conversation late last month, the US president pressed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to buy more US arms and for there to be a fairer trade balance, keeping the pressure on.",
      "And during his first term, Trump fixated on India's steep tariffs. He repeatedly slammed the then 100% duty on Harleys as \"unacceptable\", making it a rallying point in his crusade against what he saw as unfair trade practices.",
      "In the past he repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.",
      "India enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. Bilateral trade crossed $190bn (\u00a3150bn) in 2023. Merchandise exports to US have surged 40% to $123bn since 2018, while services trade grew 22% to reach $66bn. Meanwhile, US exports to India stood at $70bn.",
      "But beyond bikes, India has zeroed out import taxes on satellite ground installations, benefiting US exporters who supplied $92m worth in 2023.",

India also scrapped tariffs on select waste and scrap items, a category where US exports amounted to $2.5bn last year.",
      "Top US exports to India in 2023 included crude oil and petroleum products ($14bn), LNG, coal, medical devices, scientific instruments, scrap metals, turbojets, computers and almonds.",
      "\"While Trump has criticised India's tariff policies, the latest reductions signal a policy shift that could enhance US exports across various sectors,\" says Mr Srivastava.",
      "\"With key tariff cuts on technology, automobiles, industrial and waste imports, India appears to be taking steps towards facilitating trade even as the global trade environment remains tense.\"",
      "Meanwhile India's exports span a diverse range \u2013 from textiles, pharmaceuticals and engineering goods to petroleum oils, machinery and cut diamonds. It also ships smartphones, auto parts, shrimp, gold jewellery, footwear and iron and steel, making it a key player in global trade.",
      "\"This diverse range of products reflects India's broad export base and its strong trade relationship with the US,\" says Mr Srivastava.",
      "India was once among the world's most protectionist economies. In the 1970s, American political scientist Joseph Grieco described it as having one of the \"most restrictive, cumbersome\u2026 regimes regulating foreign direct investments\".",
      "This inward-looking approach led to a steady decline in India's export share of global trade, from 2.42% in 1948 to just 0.51% by 1991. As Aseema Sinha, author of Globalizing India: How Global Rules and Markets are Shaping India's Rise to Power, observed, this period was marked by \"a self-driven industrialisation drive, export pessimism, and suspicion of global alliances\".",
      "India finally opened up in the 1990s and 2000s, cutting average tariffs from 80% in 1990 to 13% in 2008.",
      "But after Modi launched his \"Make in India\" policy to boost manufacturing in India tariffs have climbed again to about 18% - higher than those set by other Asian nations such as China, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.",

      "Agricultural market access remains a sticking point for the US, he says.",
      "India dropped retaliatory tariffs on US-made almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts in 2023, but Trump will likely demand more. However, India may hold firm given domestic political sensitivity around farming.",
      "\"This is where we will drive a hard bargain, and problems could arise,\" cautions Mr Dhar.",
      "That said, India's strategic ties with the US \u2013 as a Quad member countering China \u2013 could help ease friction. India's willingness to accept the deportation of undocumented Indian migrants in the US without pushing back has also sent a positive signal, Mr Dhar notes.",
      "Experts also point to Modi's warm personal rapport with Trump as an advantage. Some clarity will come when the Indian prime minister visits the White House \u2013 this month, according to some reports \u2013 at Trump's invitation."

    "summary": "El Salvador has offered to take in criminals deported from the US and house them in its mega-jail.",
    "story": [
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could not have been more complimentary about the deal he struck with the president of El Salvador on Monday.",
      "The Trump administration's top diplomat appeared delighted yet stunned by the fact that President Nayib Bukele should have \"agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world\".",
      "Bukele had offered to take in people deported from the US, regardless of their nationality, and house them in El Salvador's mega-jail.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said.",
      "While that was already a win for President Donald Trump, whose priority has been to speed up the removal of undocumented migrants from the US, the real surprise came in the part of the deal Rubio mentioned next.",
      "\"He [Bukele] has also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're US citizens or legal residents,\" Rubio said.",
      "The Salvadorean leader confirmed that he had \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system\".",
      "He clarified that El Salvador would be \"willing to take in only convicted criminals\" and that his government would do so \"in exchange for a fee\".",
      "Bukele also revealed where he would house those deported from the US: \"our mega-prison\".",
      "The mega-jail, also known as Cecot (short for Terrorism Confinement Centre), has become emblematic of Bukele's iron-fist approach to crime and punishment.",
      "The maximum-security prison, one of the largest in Latin America, opened in January 2023 and can house 40,000 inmates, according to government figures.",
      "Inmates are confined to windowless cells, sleep on bare metal bunks and are constantly monitored by armed guards - some of whom watch over them from atop the lattice ceiling.",
      "BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who was allowed to take an official tour of the facility last year after the BBC had repeatedly asked for access, described how temperatures in the cells would reach 35C.",
      "Take a look at graphics and maps of the mega-jail",
      "With access to the prison severely restricted and journalists only allowed on occasional and carefully choreographed official tours, the number of inmates per cell is not clear.",
      "Some rights groups put it at 80 prisoners while others say it can go up to more than 150.",
      "Asked by our journalist what the maximum capacity was, the prison's director responded \"where you can fit 10 people, you can fit 20\".",
      "Face to face with inmates in El Salvador's mega-jail",
      "Prisoners are locked up inside their cells 24 hours a day - except for 30 minutes of group exercise in a windowless corridor.",
      "The layout of the jail is no coincidence.",
      "Following a particularly bloody weekend in 2022, when more than 70 people were killed in the small Central American nation, President Bukele wrote on social media: \"Message for the gangs: because of your actions, your 'homeboys' will not be able to see a ray of sunshine.\"",
      "Building of the Cecot mega-jail started shortly afterwards.",
      "Conditions at the facility and the treatment of inmates has come under severe criticism from human rights groups.",
      "Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, has described it as a \"concrete and steel pit\".",
      "So could the Trump administration send US citizens there?",
      "On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he would embrace the idea but questioned its legality.",
      "\"If we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,\" he said during an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office. \"I don't know if we do or not.",
      "\"We're looking at that right now, but we could make deals where we'd get these animals out of our country.\"",
      "But any attempt to deport US citizens or people lawfully resident in the US to a foreign jail is bound to face legal challenges.",
      "US citizens who were born in the United States enjoy legal protection from deportation.",
      "There are some cases, however, in which naturalised citizens - those who were not born in the US and who obtained US citizenship after birth through a legal process - can have their citizenship revoked.",
      "This tends to occur when the person in question used fraud to obtain the citizenship in the first place.",
      "Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that naturalised US citizens suspected of ties to criminal gangs or terrorist organisations - such as the Tren de Aragua criminal gang or the Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13 - could also, in theory, be stripped of US citizenship.",
      "\"If they find out you were a member of any group that persecuted or threatened to persecute others, they can try to denaturalise you,\" Mr Cuic added.",
      "\"So, if you had gang ties and never disclosed them, they could use that as a reason to denaturalise you.\"",
      "Once a person has been \"denaturalised\", they are at risk of deportation.",
      "Mr Cuic pointed out that any such move would have to be preceded by a \"formal court process\" conducted in a federal court.",
      "But the lawyer warned that \"citizenship is not something that is definitively forever if you are naturalised\".",
      "He stressed, though, that he had \"never heard\" of cases of natural-born US citizens being sent abroad for imprisonment for crimes committed and prosecuted in the US.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, similarly said that she had \"never heard of such a suggestion\" as sending American citizens to serve US prison sentences overseas.",
      "While she acknowledged that there were various scenarios in which naturalised US citizens could lose their citizenship, she said that \"you can't denaturalise a natural-born citizen\".",
      "The status of lawful permanent residents in the US, however, is more precarious than that of US citizens.",
      "They can be deported if they violate certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include committing drug offences, violent crimes or crimes such as theft, fraud or assault.",
      "Like naturalised citizens, they can also be deported if they obtained their residency through fraud.",
      "Permanent lawful residents who are involved in terrorism, espionage or any activity threatening US national interest could also be deported.",
      "This last point is important in light of the executive order President Trump issued on his inauguration day in which he designated drug cartels as \"foreign terrorist organisations\".",
      "Two criminal organisations named in the executive order, Tren de Aragua and MS-13, were also mentioned last week by Trump's special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone.",
      "Speaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Claver-Carone not only praised Bukele's handling of the MS-13 - a gang which is deeply rooted in El Salvador and has long terrorised its citizens - but also said that Bukele could offer the answer on how to deal with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Claver-Carone also appeared to argue that the mere prospect of being sent to a Salvadoran jail could drive Venezuelan gang members back to their homeland.",
      "\"I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador,\" he said of members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Rubio, too, seemed to stress that the Trump administration would first and foremost want to send members of these two notorious gangs to El Salvador's prisons.",
      "\"Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal - MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be - he has offered his jails,\" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele.",
      "While it is by no means clear who - if anyone - will be sent from the US to El Salvador's mega-prison, what is certain is that with his \"unprecedented offer of friendship\", Bukele has landed firmly in Trump's favour at a time when relations between the US and its neighbours have been rocked by the US president's threats to impose tariffs on their goods.",

    "title": "Five ways China is hitting back against US tariffs",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 14:40:33 GMT",
    "summary": "China has set out a series of measures to kick in next week after the US introduced 10% tariffs on imports from the country.",
    "story": [
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated after China hit back against the introduction of tariffs by the US with measures of its own.",
      "Beijing has set out to target specific American goods with retaliatory taxes, among other measures, following the blanket 10% tariff introduced by President Donald Trump on all Chinese imports to the US.",
      "In some ways, this latest tit-for-tat is nothing new and builds on the long-running trade dispute between the nations, with tariffs having already been imposed and threatened on various goods since 2018.",
      "Trump has said he plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, so a deal could yet be struck. But if China proceeds with its response on 10 February as planned, what could the impact be?",
      "Coal, oil and gas",
      "Part of China's countermeasures to Trump's tariffs is to announce import taxes of its own on US coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 10%, and a 15% charge on crude oil.",
      "The response from Beijing means companies wanting to import fossil fuels from the US would have to pay the tax in order to do so.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of coal, but it gets most of it from Indonesia, although Russia, Australia and Mongolia are also among its suppliers.",
      "When it comes to the US, China has been increasing imports of LNG from the country, with volumes nearly double 2018 levels, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "But its overall fossil fuel trade is modest, with US imports accounting for just 1.7% of China's total crude oil bought from abroad in 2023. This suggests China is not dependent on the US and so the impact of the tariffs on its economy could be minimal.",
      "Rebecca Harding, a trade economist and chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security think tank, said China could easily source more supplies from Russia, where it has already been buying oil on the cheap as the Kremlin seeks to fund its war effort.",
      "On the flipside, the US is the world's largest LNG exporter, and so has plenty of other customers, particularly the UK and the European Union.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?Trump sows uncertainty - and Xi Jinping sees an opportunity",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?",
      "Trump sows uncertainty - and Xi Jinping sees an opportunity",
      "Agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks and big cars",
      "As well as fuel, China has slapped a 10% tariff on agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks, and some large cars.",
      "But China is not a big importer of US pick-ups and it gets most of its cars from Europe and Japan, so a 10% tariff on an already small number of imports would not hit consumers too hard.",
      "In recent years, China has increased investments in farm machinery to enhance production and reduce reliance on imports, and to strengthen its food security.",
      "So the introduction of tariffs on agricultural machinery might be another move to try to boost domestic industry.",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at consultancy Capital Economics, said all the tariff measures were \"fairly modest, at least relative to US moves\".",
      "He suggests that China's targeted goods represent about $20bn (\u00a316bn) worth of annual imports - around 12% of China's total imports from the US.",
      "\"This is a far cry from the more than $450bn worth of Chinese goods being targeted by the US.\"",
      "But he said China had \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the US [and domestic audiences] without inflicting too much damage\".",
      "Google probe",
      "The Chinese authorities have also announced some non-tariff measures, one of which is an anti-monopoly investigation into US tech giant Google.",
      "It is unclear what the investigation will involve, but for context, Google's search services have been blocked in China since 2010.",
      "The company still has some business presence in the country through providing apps and games to the Chinese markets by working with local developers.",
      "But China only generates about 1% of Google's global sales, which suggests if it cut ties entirely with the country, it wouldn't be much worse off.",
      "Calvin Klein added to 'unreliable entities' list",
      "China has added PVH, the American company that owns designer brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, to its so-called \"unreliable entity\" list and accused them of \"discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises\".",
      "The list, which has other US firms on it, was created in 2020 by Beijing amid the heating up of trade tensions.",
      "For Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, being on China's list will make it harder to do business in the country. They may face sanctions, including fines, and having the work visas of their foreign employees revoked.",
      "Regulators will also go to factories of the firms to investigate operations, according to Andreas Schotter, professor of international business at Western University in Ontario, Canada.",
      "The US has its own \"entity list\", which bars certain organisations from buying products from US companies without approval from Washington.",
      "\"China is hitting back in the same way President Trump is accusing Chinese companies. This is all part of the US driven de-coupling of the US and China,\" Prof Schotter added.",

      "China probes Calvin Klein over Xinjiang cotton",
      "Export controls on rare metals",
      "While tariffs have been placed on the companies wanting to import goods from abroad, China has also imposed export controls on 25 rare metals.",
      "Some of the metals are key components for many electrical products and military equipment.",
      "China has mastered the ability to refine such metals, and produced almost 90% of global refined output.",
      "The restricted list includes tungsten, which is difficult to source and a crucial material for the aerospace industry.",
      "While there are restrictions on exports, Mr Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics, said it was notable that the critical metals China imports from the US, which are used to make high-end chips, semiconductor machinery, pharmaceuticals and aerospace equipment were not targeted in any measures.",
      "The experience of previous rounds of restrictions suggests exports will drop sharply as companies scramble to get licences, a process that takes several weeks.",
      "When it comes to the impact of the restrictions, it appears the US has a plan. On Monday, Trump said he wanted Ukraine to guarantee the supply of more rare earth metals in exchange for $300bn of support in its fight against Russia."

    "title": "Trump faces moment of reckoning on trade after delaying tariffs",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:06:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The president will soon have to decide whether to match his trade rhetoric with action or shelve his tariff plans.",
    "story": [
      "For the first week of Donald Trump's presidency, tariffs - a favourite talking point during last year's presidential campaign - were the dogs that didn't bark.",
      "Trade seemed to take a back seat while the new administration pressed ahead on immigration enforcement, pardons of Capitol riot convictions, a fossil-fuel energy policy and federal workforce upheaval - among a range of other disruptive new measures.",
      "That all changed this past weekend when Trump announced sweeping 25% tariffs on US allies Canada and Mexico, along with 10% duties on Chinese imports.",
      "And while he has since delayed imposing those tariffs on his North American neighbours for a month after both countries agreed new border measures, the president still faces a moment of reckoning in which he will ultimately have to decide whether to match his rhetoric with action.",
      "Trump often talks of the trade deficits between the US and its two neighbours as a key source of his dissatisfaction. If that's the case, then no amount of new border security or drug seizures - whatever the metrics or specific demands - will make the president fully abandon his tariff threats.",
      "Trump has also said he views tariffs not just as a tool to achieve policy objectives, but as a permanent source of US revenue and a means to fund government programmes and reduce the budget deficit. And if that is his ultimate objective, then tariffs on America's largest trading partners may be the only effective answer.",
      "Global financial markets reeled at this prospect on Monday, as the US appeared on the brink of waging a multi-front trade war with some of its closest economic partners.",
      "Then, after conversations with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump put the tariffs on pause. While the new duties on China have gone into effect - and have prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing - markets have viewed those US moves as less disruptive and smaller in scope.",
      "By contrast, if US had engaged in an escalating series of tariffs with Canada and Mexico, which accounted for more than $1.57tn (\u00a31.24tn) in goods in 2023, the global economic effect could have been catastrophic.",
      "That possibly dire development has been averted, for now, with Trump and his administration declaring at least a partial victory.",
      "The details of what Canada and Mexico conceded, however, paint a more complicated picture.",
      "While Canada agreed to form a joint anti-crime strike force with the US and appoint a \"fentanyl tsar\", the concrete steps it detailed were all part of a border-security package Canada had previously announced.",
      "Mexico pledged stepped up drug enforcement and 10,000 troops to patrol the US-Mexico border - but those numbers mirror the deployments the nation made in 2019 and again in 2021",
      "In a month's time, Trump will again have to decide if Canada and Mexico are doing enough to satisfy his demands - or whether the delayed tariffs will go into effect.",
      "Solid figures demonstrating progress, however, may be hard to come by.",
      "The opening salvos have been fired in Trump's trade war - what comes next?What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?Who won and lost as Trump's trade war is delayed - for now",
      "The opening salvos have been fired in Trump's trade war - what comes next?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?",
      "Who won and lost as Trump's trade war is delayed - for now",
      "By the administration's own measures, US immigration officials only seized 43lbs (19.5kg) of fentanyl and caught 193,540 people crossing at the US-Canada border in 2024. The numbers are much higher for the US-Mexico border, but undocumented crossings - and drug seizures- are down there, as well.",
      "Global financial markets have calmed considerably since Monday morning's tariff-inspired disruption. Investors, it seems, have concluded that on trade Trump is more bluster than action.",
      "The president may be able to extract more concessions from Canadian and Mexican leaders in a month's time, but they may also conclude at some point that Trump doesn't have the will to follow through on his threats.",
      "Despite claims of success, his sabre-rattling on trade could ultimately produce diminishing returns.",
      "At that point, the president would have a decision to make. Does he shelve his most sweeping tariff plans for good? Were his dreams of returning the US to late-19th century trade policy - which he has said was a golden age of American economic power - unrealistic?",
      "Or does he press ahead with his vision of a new, more America-focused global trade order despite the risk of at least short-term economic pain?",
      "That moment of reckoning has been delayed. But it is coming.",

    "story": [
      "Beijing has made its decision. After days of warning of counter measures and urging Washington to enter negotiations and \"meet China halfway\", it has decided to hit back \u2013 or at least threaten to retaliate with its own tariffs.",
      "China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the US from 10 February.",
      "The date is important. It means there is still time for the world's two largest economies to step back from the brink of a trade war.",

      "Five ways China is hitting back against US tariffs",
      "Firstly, China's counter measures are limited in scope compared to Donald Trump's levy of 10% on all Chinese goods heading to the US.",
      "America is the biggest exporter of liquid natural gas across the world, but China accounts for only around 2.3% of those exports and its major car imports are from Europe and Japan.",
      "This calculated and selective targeting of goods may just be an opening shot by Beijing, a way of gaining some bargaining power and leverage ahead of any talks.",
      "Officials in China may be encouraged by the cordial start to the US-China relationship since Trump took office.",
      "The US president said he had a \"very good\" phone call with President Xi days before his inaugural ceremony, which was attended by the highest-level Chinese official ever to be dispatched to such an event. He has also suggested that he hopes to work with Xi on resolving Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "President Xi might not want to pick a fight with Trump just yet as he is busy trying to shore up his own ailing economy.",
      "This is also familiar territory for both leaders \u2013 although they might not be keen to relive the past. There was a honeymoon period in US-China relations during Trump's last term, before the relationship soured.",
      "To deal or not to deal",
      "It will also be far more difficult for Trump to do a deal with China than with Mexico and Canada  - and much will depend on what he wants from Beijing.",
      "China is Washington's chief economic rival and cutting the country off from major supply chains has been a goal of the Trump administration.",
      "If Trump asks for too much, Xi might feel he can walk away and there will be limits on just how far he is willing to be pushed.",
      "The US president is dealing with a far more confident China than he did back then. Beijing has expanded its global footprint, and it is now the lead trade partner for more than 120 countries.",
      "Over the past two decades, it has also steadily tried to reduce the importance of trade to its economy and ramped up domestic production. Today, imports and exports account for around 37% of China's GDP, compared with more than 60% in the early 2000s, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "The 10% tariff will sting, but Beijing may feel it can absorb the blow \u2013 for now.",
      "The fear will be that President Trump is serious about ramping up that percentage to the 60% he pledged during his campaign or that he will continue to use the threat of tariffs as a recurring diplomatic tool to hold over Xi's head.",
      "If that happens, Beijing will want to be ready and that means having a clear strategy in case this escalates.",
      "Learning from the past",
      "The last time the leaders signed a deal it did not end well.",
      "The two countries issued tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods from 2018.",
      "It lasted more than two years until eventually China agreed to spend an extra $200bn (\u00a3161bn) a year on US goods in 2020.",
      "Washington hoped the deal would bring down the huge trade deficit between China and the US, but the plan was derailed by the Covid pandemic and that deficit now sits at $361bn, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "There are also key challenges for China as it is thinking several steps ahead in any negotiation.",
      "Beijing still sells nearly four times more goods to the United States than it buys - and during Trump's first term in office, it ran out of items to target.",

    "summary": "Are we seeing the opening moves in a wider trade war, and what are the potential economic consequences?",
    "story": [
      "Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.",
      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",
      "But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?",
      "Trump's 10% tariff on China begins as Beijing plans retaliation on US energy and some cars",
      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods, citing Beijing's failure to stop the export of chemicals used in the production of the powerful opioid fentanyl.",
      "The US has long accused Chinese corporations of knowingly supplying groups involved in the creation of the drug. Beijing has hit back with tariffs of its own.",
      "The White House has also accused Canada and Mexico of failing to prevent criminal gangs from smuggling fentanyl into the US.",
      "Trump had planned tariffs against both those countries but he suspended that threat after winning some concessions on increased border security.",
      "How serious is the fentanyl crisis in the US?",
      "Fentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals. US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.",
      "Over 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).",
      "It is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.",
      "As little as a two milligram dose of fentanyl - roughly the size of a pencil tip - can be fatal.",
      "Over the past decade, the global fentanyl supply chain has expanded, making it harder for law enforcement and policymakers to control.",
      "China is the primary source of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.",
      "Most fentanyl enters the US via Mexico",
      "Since September, 4,500lb (2,040kg) of fentanyl have been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).",
      "Almost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. Less than 1% was seized across the northern US border with Canada. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.",
      "According to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.",
      "The chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.",
      "According to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.",
      "The Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels. Mexico's President Sheinbaum says the claims are \"slander.\"",
      "In December, shortly after Trump had threatened Mexico with tariffs, the country's security forces announced their largest ever seizure of fentanyl - equivalent to around 20 million doses.",
      "China is the main source of fentanyl chemicals",
      "In 2019, China classified fentanyl as a controlled narcotic and later added some of the chemicals used to make it to the list.",
      "Despite this, the trade in other chemicals involved in the manufacturing of fentanyl - some of which can have legitimate purposes - remain uncontrolled, as those involved in the trade find new ways to evade the law.",
      "A review of several US indictments, which include details of undercover agents communicating with Chinese manufacturers, suggests that some chemical companies in China have been selling chemicals - including controlled ones - in the knowledge that they are intended to make fentanyl.",

      "\"So you have these massive loopholes where criminals engage in selling legal products, but they knowingly sell them to criminal entities,\" says Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institute.",
      "In a statement, China said it had some of the strictest drugs laws in the world and had conducted joint operations with the US in the past.",
      "\"The US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue,\" it said.",
      "And while China remains the main source of the chemicals used to make fentanyl, the DEA has also identified India as an emerging major source for these chemicals.",
      "In a US indictment from January 2025, two chemical companies in India were charged with supplying the chemicals used to make fentanyl to the US and Mexico.",
      "Canada's role in the fentanyl trade",
      "President Trump has accused Canada - alongside Mexico - of allowing \"vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in\" to the US.",
      "According to data from the US Customs and Border Patrol, only about 0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl entering the US are made at the Canadian border, almost all the rest is confiscated at the US border with Mexico.",
      "But in January, Canada's financial intelligence agency reported that organised criminal groups in Canada are increasingly involved in the production of fentanyl by importing chemicals used to make it and lab equipment from China.",
      "The trade in fentanyl takes place in both directions. In the first 10 months of 2024, the Canadian border service reported seizing 10.8lb (4.9kg) of fentanyl entering from the US, while US Border Patrol intercepted 32.1lb (14.6kg) of fentanyl coming from Canada.",

    "summary": "Some people didn't expect it to last a year. Here's how the popular life simulator has stayed alive.",
    "story": [
      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",
      "\"That's been so wonderful that I have been able to tell my stories and connect with people and they can see themselves represented,\" she says.",

      "American content creator Amira, known as Xmiramira online, created a custom skin tone pack for The Sims 4 that's still used by many players today.",
      "\"I couldn't make Sims that either look similar to me or my family, friends. And that's the case in a lot of games,\" says Amira.",
      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",

      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",

      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",

      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",

      "The contradictions in Ani, and the shifting genres of the movie were elements that Madison says she embraced strongly during the filming.",
      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",

      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",
      "She played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.",
      "She fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

    "story": [
      "Like many homes, Suzanne de Passe's is filled with stuff. Her version of stuff? Gold and platinum albums. Snapshots with Stevie Wonder and a young Michael Jackson. The Oscar-nominated screenplay she co-wrote for \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" Her 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Award.",
      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",
      "\"For someone who worked behind the scenes and in the shadows, you felt seen?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh, definitely. I felt very seen, and very blessed.\"",

    "summary": "The multimedia artist talks about his cinematic timepiece, a 24-hour film comprised of scenes from movies and TV that track the viewer's own experience of time, minute by minute, currently screening at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",
      "It's been more than a decade since \"The Clock\" was last in New York. Marclay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened, insisting that any museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so audiences can see the nighttime section.",
      "Are there \"Clock\" completists? \"Oh, there are definitely 'Clock' squatters, I would say \u2013     people who really commit to watching it!\" Comer laughed.",
      "But Marclay insists the point isn't to see all of it; it's more to make you hyper-aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock. \"Here, you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time, that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing,\" Marclay said. \"You're more than a viewer. You're a participant in a way, because your life infringes on this clock.\"",

    "summary": "A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in a state with one of the strictest abortion bans.",
    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",
      "\"It's making it less safe to be pregnant, and it's increasing things like infant mortality and maternal mortality in states where abortions are restricted,\" she said.",

Harvey, head of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement to CBS News.",

      "\"People will get sick. And, especially in cases like congenital syphilis where you cannot lose a day to treat, babies will die,\" said Harvey.",
      "Some changes were minor and kept webpages online, like rewording information about Zika virus from saying \"pregnant person\" to \"pregnant woman\" instead.",
      "Others have resulted in gutting key parts of the agency's website. Data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, a nationwide survey of high school students about mental health, substance abuse and violence, were also wiped from the website.",

      "Letters obtained by CBS News sent to nonprofits and state and local health departments receiving federal health dollars also left some grant recipients confused.",

      "Another targeted mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that similar to federal rules, they also were now required to \"immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting\" those ideas \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contracts\" supported by the funds.",
      "Some hospitals also said this week they are moving to suspend medications and procedures for youth seeking gender-affirming care, following an executive order signed on Tuesday by President Trump to curb procedures and prescriptions for gender transitions in minors.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:55:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "It's not using \"End Racism\" for the first time since the NFL began using Super Bowl end zone stencils.",
      "\"The Super Bowl is often a snapshot in time and the NFL is in a unique position to capture and lift the imagination of the country,\" league spokesman Brian McCarthy said. \"'Choose Love' is appropriate to use as our country has endured in recent weeks wildfires in Southern California, the terrorist attack here in New Orleans, the plane and helicopter crash near our nation's capital and the plane crash in Philadelphia.\"",

      "Two people familiar with the league's thinking shot down the notion that Mr. Trump's presence is the reason \"End Racism\" isn't being stenciled in an end zone.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 07:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's control of a federal payment system is raising concerns about funding for programs like Social Security and the safety of personal data.",
    "story": [
      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However, CBS News obtained a letter sent from Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official with the Treasury Department, to members of Congress Tuesday, which claimed that DOGE will only have \"read-only\" access to the department's data.",
      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "In a response to Wyden's letter, however, Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official at Treasury, told Wyden that DOGE personnel are only only able to read \"coded data\" in the federal payment system and cannot change scheduled systems. DOGE \"has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed,\" Blum wrote.",
      "Bloomberg was the first to report on the letter.",
      "Warren said Blum's letter raised more questions than answers.\u00a0\"It asserts that a set of Treasury staff members have 'read-only' access but fails to answer questions about non-Treasury employees, like those working for Elon Musk and DOGE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",

      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, providing them with the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow-and-black laurel wreath symbol.",

      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",

      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",
      "That lawsuit pointed out that, at the time of its filing, Musk's status with the federal government was unclear.",
      "\"The Trump administration has not publicly revealed whether Mr. Musk has been made an officer or employee of the U.S. government or remains a private citizen,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Trump administration also has not publicly revealed the employment status of other individuals who are part of DOGE.\"",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

The panel will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \"cutting red tape\" and boosting domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said.

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:11:57 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House levied new import duties on its three closest trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could soon be paying more for everything from automobiles to avocados after the Trump administration levied\u00a0stiff new tariffs\u00a0on the nation's three largest trading partners.",
      "President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. However, Mr. Trump on Monday said he was pausing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

    "story": [
      "Republican officials have been quietly pointing out that the Trump administration's so-called buyout program is illegal, but they doubt that congressional Republicans\u00a0will push back, sources told CBS News.",
      "Many federal workers saw an email first thing Monday morning when they arrived at their desks that offered more details of the deferred resignations program.",
      "Some lawmakers have noted the offer of pay through Sept. 30 violates the Anti-Deficiency Act, a law that prevents the government from promising or spending money in excess of what Congress has made available. Congress has funded the government only through mid-March, not through the end of the fiscal year at the end of September.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management stressed that no federal employees' pay will be guaranteed with the deadline looming.",
      "The new email, with \"Fork in the Road\" in the subject line, is the third sent by OPM on the resignation plan. It reads:",
      "Q: The current funding bill for the federal government expires on March 14. Will I still receive full pay and benefits if the money runs out?",
      "A: Any government shutdown could potentially affect an employee's pay regardless of whether he or she has accepted the deferred resignation offer. Moreover, if you accept the deferred resignation offer, you would still be entitled to backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday took the first steps toward his administration creating a government-owned investment fund, tasking the heads of the Treasury Department and Commerce Department with beginning the process to create an American sovereign wealth fund.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order that charges Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, with beginning a process \"that will hopefully result in the creation of an American sovereign wealth fund,\" announced Will Scharf, Mr. Trump's staff secretary.",

      "President Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, authorized a\u00a0wave of new import duties\u00a0Saturday on America's three closest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China. The tariffs on Mexico and Canada were later put on pause for a month.",
      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",
      "Because American businesses are on the hook for paying the tariffs on imports, they historically have passed on some or all of those costs to consumers. At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home. For instance, consumers may opt to buy U.S.-made products rather than newly pricier imports, while companies may choose to avoid tariffs by opening new plants in the U.S.",
      "\"Come make your product in America,\" Mr. Trump said last week at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. \"But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\"",
      "Many economists and other trade experts say tariffs are not beneficial. The Peterson Institute for International Economics points out that tariffs \"have a poor record\" of sparking a resurgence in manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25%\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday wrote on his Truth Social app that he is\u00a0pausing U.S. tariffs\u00a0targeting imports from Mexico for a month after the country's president agreed to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the flow of fentanyl and migrants. The tariffs on Canada were also paused a short time later.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed as a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also choose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",
      "In contrast to Brussels' plans, Oslo has not banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, having instead opted for a system of generous tax breaks that have made them competitive against heavily taxed internal combustion cars.",
      "They have also benefitted from toll exemptions, free parking in public car parks, and the use of public transport traffic lanes.",
      "How Norway has driven the EV transition",
      "While some tax breaks and incentives have been rolled back over the years, electric cars have become commonplace on Norwegian roads.",
      "\"It was a decision primarily motivated by climate and environment considerations,\" Frode Hvattum, a 50-year-old father of three who owns two EVs, told AFP.",
      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",
      "In his upscale neighborhood of Baerum in suburban Oslo, the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Competitively priced Chinese brands are increasingly appearing too.",
      "Many homes have a garage with an EV charger, in addition to Norway's vast national network of superfast charging stations that keep the nation rolling.",
      "That was a precondition for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, travels frequently by car to his chalet in the mountains several hours from Oslo.",
      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",
      "\"We should finish the year at between 95 and 100%, and probably even in the high end of this range,\" Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, told AFP.",
      "A new tax increase on internal combustion cars and rechargeable hybrids \u2014 which are cleaner but still run partially on gas or diesel \u2014 on April 1 should help.",
      "In January, diesel cars \u2014 still common in much of Europe \u2014\u00a0accounted for just 1.5% of new cars registered in Norway, and gasoline cars just 0.4%, according to the OFV.",
      "\"Political leaders can't rest on their laurels,\" Bu warned. \"They have to maintain the advantages, such as the toll discounts, so the transition to EVs spreads on the second-hand market.\"",

Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the pause in his own social media post, saying the newly deployed Mexican forces \"will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",
      "Below is a look at some of the reaction from the countries now facing new U.S. tariffs, which will come into effect on Tuesday, and those which might still be hoping to avoid them.",
      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "In Bill Gates' new autobiography, \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" (published February 4 by Knopf), the computer pioneer and philanthropist writes of his formative years, and the experiences that led him to the then-burgeoning world of computers.",
      "Read an excerpt below about how, in eighth grade, he discovered BASIC, which introduced him to the elegance and exacting demands of computer code; and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Bill Gates on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" February 2!",
      "\"Source Code: My Beginnings\" by Bill Gates",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",
      "Ready . . .",
      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:44:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "Kennedy has since transferred ownership of the trademark application to a limited liability company managed by Del Gibtree, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.",

The PA has limited authority over the other, larger Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is run separately from Gaza.",
      "\"These calls represent a serious violation of international law, and peace and stability in the region will not be achieved without the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,\" Abbas said.",
      "Negotiations have begun over the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which has seen 18 hostages released by Hamas and other militants in Gaza since it came into effect on January 19, including one man who is an American citizen.",
      "In the current, six-week first phase of the deal, Hamas is to free more hostages every week in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners being released from Israeli jails.",
      "If the deal holds, the hostage and prisoner exchanges will continue, with a total of 33 Israeli captives set to be released during the first phase.

      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However, CBS News obtained a letter sent from Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official with the Treasury Department, to members of Congress Tuesday, which claimed that DOGE will only have \"read-only\" access to the department's data.",
      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "In a response to Wyden's letter, however, Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official at Treasury, told Wyden that DOGE personnel are only only able to read \"coded data\" in the federal payment system and cannot change scheduled systems. DOGE \"has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed,\" Blum wrote.",
      "Bloomberg was the first to report on the letter.",
      "Warren said Blum's letter raised more questions than answers.\u00a0\"It asserts that a set of Treasury staff members have 'read-only' access but fails to answer questions about non-Treasury employees, like those working for Elon Musk and DOGE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Richard Escobedo and \n                                                  \n                      The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "In a news conferrence with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump said the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip\" and \"own it.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip\" and \"own it,\" continuing to promote the idea that the Palestinian people should live elsewhere.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose comments came at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Palestinians in Gaza \"should not go through a process of rebuilding\" and that they had \"lived a miserable existence there.\" Earlier in the afternoon, during a meeting with Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the Palestinians should \"resettle permanently\" in \"nice homes\" somewhere else.",
      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings \u2014\u00a0 level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\"",
      "\"Just can't go back,\" he continued. \"If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.\"",
      "Netanyahu, who is the first foreign leader to visit Mr. Trump during his second term, said of the president's idea, \"We're talking about it. He's exploring it with his people, with his staff. I think it's something that could change history, and it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\"",
      "On whether U.S. troops would be sent to Gaza, the president said, \"As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that.\"",
      "\"We're going to take over that piece,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it'll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.\"",
      "The president was asked by a reporter what authority he has to take over a sovereign territory, and he replied that he's studied the matter closely for months.",
      "\"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president said his decision about taking over Gaza \"was not a decision made lightly,\" and he claimed he's received praise from other leaders in the Middle East, though he did not identify any by name. Two sources said later that top Trump aides knew in advance of Netanyahu's visit that the president planned to announce the proposal regarding U.S. ownership of Gaza.",
      "Leaders of several of the most powerful Arab nations previously said they strongly opposed any suggestion that residents of Gaza be resettled in other countries.",
      "Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said in a statement reported by the Reuters news agency Wednesday that the kingdom \"rejects any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land\" and wouldn't establish diplomatic ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman affirmed the kingdom's position in \"a clear and explicit manner\" that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances, the statement said.",
      "Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri was also quick to dismiss the idea out of hand, telling Reuters the president's \"remarks about his desire to control Gaza are ridiculous and absurd, and any ideas of this kind are capable of igniting the region.\"",
      "Hamas also called Mr. Trump \"racist\" and said his plan aims to \"eliminate the Palestinian cause,\" according to Agency France-Presse.",
      "Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat and the first Palestinian-American to serve in Congress, was blunt, asserting in a post on X that Trump was \"openly calling for ethnic cleansing.\"",
      "In the past, Mr. Trump has voiced support for a \"realistic two-state solution.\" Gaza, a 139-square-mile strip of land that shares borders with Israel and Egypt, has been fought over for years. Palestinians have been refugees for decades, since Israel gained control of it in the 1967 Six-Day War with Egypt, Jordan and Syria.",
      "Asked who would eventually live in Gaza once it's rebuilt, Mr. Trump said it should be an international place.",
      "\"I envision world people living there, the world's people,\" he said, adding that the residents should be \"representatives from all over the world, Palestinians, also.\" He said it would be \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump opened the news conference by reinforcing his warm relationship with Netanyahu, saying they had forged a successful partnership in his first term. He claimed that the last four years \u2014 under former President Joe Biden \u2014 had not seen as many successes.",
      "He claimed \"the grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East \u2026 the horrors of Oct. 7 would never have happened if I were president.\"",
      "In the wake of the massacre of Israeli civilians in 2023, however, Netanyahu praised Biden \"for his vital support for Israel.\"",
      "Netanyahu suggested Mr. Trump may be unconventional, but he has good ideas, and they work well together.",
      "\"After the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, 'You know, he's right,'\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu told reporters he found he had something else in common with Mr. Trump, too \u2014 he said Iran has tried to kill them both.",
      "Trump, Netanyahu meet in Oval Office before news conference",
      "Seated next to Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump repeatedly said he doesn't think Palestinians want to return to Gaza and said that he thinks Jordan, Egypt and other nations would accept Palestinians, even though they've said they won't.",
      "\"They are not gonna want to go back to Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that Palestinians would only \"end up dying\" there, and suggesting Palestinians should have a permanent settlement elsewhere.",
      "\"If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death, like what's happening in Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And right now you have in Gaza a very dangerous situation in terms of explosives all over the place, in terms of tunnels that nobody knows who's in the tunnel. The whole thing is a mess.\"",
      "The president said other \"rich\" nations should pay for a new home for Palestinians, although he did not expand on this suggestion.",
      "Netanyahu largely allowed Mr. Trump to speak. One reporter asked the Israeli prime minister whether former President Joe Biden or Mr. Trump is more responsible for the hostage and ceasefire deal.",
      "\"I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,\" Netanyahu replied.",
      "The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered in part by the U.S., continues to hold so far. Dual citizen Keith Siegel was the first American to be released since the implementation began last month, although other Americans have been released before.",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu said he would discuss \"victory over Hamas\" with Mr. Trump, as well as countering Iran and building on diplomatic relationships with Arab nations.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday that he has \"no guarantees that the peace is going to hold.\"",
      "The president's meeting with Netanyahu being his first with a foreign leader signals how the Trump White House views the U.S.-Israel relationship.",
      "\"Trump is going to continue his support for our great ally, Israel,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Fox News Tuesday.",
      "Waltz said the U.S. and Israel have \"more to go\" in terms of returning Americans held hostage. And the national security adviser said the U.S. has to think \"realistically\" about rebuilding Gaza.",
      "\"I would push back on the characterization of cleaning out Gaza,\" Waltz told reporters Tuesday. \"I think President Trump is looking at this from a humanitarian standpoint. You have these people that are sitting with literally thousands of unexploded ordnance and piles of rubble. You know, at some point we have to look realistically. How do you rebuild Gaza? What does that look like? What's the timeline? I think we, a lot of people, were looking at very unrealistic timelines. We're talking 10, 15, years, not the five years. And so that is what, that's what we have to work through. That's part of what we'll work through with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\"",
      "Netanyahu last met with Mr. Trump in July at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, while Mr. Trump was still a presidential candidate.",
      "Netanyahu congratulated former President Joe Biden on his win in 2020, something that Mr. Trump long held against him. But the two have worked to repair the relationship in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Pam Bondi as attorney general, installing a key ally of President Trump's to take the helm of the Justice Department.",
      "Bondi's nomination for attorney general was approved by the upper chamber 54 to 46, with one Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joining all Republicans in voting to confirm her. She will take over as the nation's top law enforcement officer as Mr. Trump has pledged to end what he calls the weaponization of the Justice Department and threatened to target his critics.",
      "During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Bondi said she would \"not politicize\" the department and said \"justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country.\"",
      "\"If confirmed, I will work to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"Under my watch, the partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "In the days since Mr. Trump began his second term in office, the Senate has been working to confirm his Cabinet picks. The GOP-led upper chamber installed the top members of his national security team first and now is moving to approve the remaining nominees who will lead federal departments.",
      "Bondi's nomination was first approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a 12-10 party-line vote before it was considered by the upper chamber.",
      "As attorney general, Bondi will oversee a sprawling department that includes numerous law enforcement components, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Both agencies have often been the target of attacks by Mr. Trump. The president selected another staunch defender, Kash Patel, to lead the FBI.",
      "Bondi will also have the power to investigate the federal probes involving Mr. Trump that were overseen by former special counsel Jack Smith. Smith resigned from the role before the president returned to office, and the two cases brought against Mr. Trump were dismissed because of longstanding Justice Department policy that precludes the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Now, with Mr. Trump back in the White House, his administration has been overseeing the ouster of certain Justice Department employees. Acting Attorney General James McHenry, selected by the president to temporarily lead the department, fired roughly a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for Smith because \"he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official said.",
      "And department leadership directed the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., Edward Martin, to terminate prosecutors who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to a Jan. 31 memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "At the FBI, which is a component of the Justice Department, the acting deputy attorney general ordered the acting head of the bureau to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned to the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack for review to \"determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "FBI supervisors have also received questionnaires for certain agents in their field offices that contain questions about their possible work on the Jan. 6 cases, such as whether they participated in a search, if they made any arrests or testified in court.",
      "Bondi has previously suggested that the Justice Department prosecutors who were involved in the cases against Mr. Trump would face their own investigation and has repeated the president's claim that there is a so-called deep state of career government employees working to undermine him.",
      "\"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them,\" she told Fox News after he was charged in 2023.",
      "Bondi takes the helm of the Justice Department without the federal prosecution experience that her predecessors have had. She served two terms as Florida's attorney general, during which her office led lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act and former President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "After leaving office in 2019, she worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for Ballard Partners, a Florida-based firm. During her tenure there, she represented corporations including General Motors, Amazon and Uber, and lobbied on behalf of the Qatari government, according to registration forms submitted to the federal government.",
      "Bondi briefly left her post at Ballard Partners to serve as a member of Mr. Trump's defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats in his first term. She defended Mr. Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which he pressured Zelenskyy to investigate former President Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democrat-led House, becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached, and acquitted by the Republican-led Senate following a trial, where Bondi was part of Mr. Trump's team.",
      "She also spearheaded legal efforts following the 2020 election to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and falsely asserted Mr. Trump won the battleground state. Bondi told the Senate Judiciary Committee during her confirmation hearing that she accepts the results of the election.",
      "Mr. Trump selected Bondi for attorney general after his first pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, withdrew his name from consideration. Gaetz had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, and he denied any wrongdoing.",

    "story": [
      "China said Tuesday it would counter President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports. It also announced an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures aimed at the U.S., ratcheting up trade tensions between the two economic heavyweights.",
      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday but Mr. Trump paused his plans to\u00a0implement them\u00a0for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",
      "Google didn't immediately comment.",
      "Mr. Trump paused his plans Monday to\u00a0implement steep tariffs\u00a0on imports from Mexico and Canada for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So ... they could put some significant harm on our economy,\" said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.",
      "The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute.",
      "\"I don't think they want the trade war escalating,\" he said. \"And they see (the) example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.\"",
      "But, he adds, \"A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,\" Dover said.",

    "story": [
      "The vice presidency may have taken JD Vance out of the Senate, but his brief service there has turned out to be instrumental in the early weeks of the Trump administration.",
      "Vance has proven to be essential in getting President Trump's most controversial cabinet nominees cleared through committees to a full Senate confirmation vote. Multiple Republican senators who were on the fence about supporting some of the president's picks have said it was Vance, their former Senate colleague, who helped them get them to yes on some of President Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana and a key swing vote, was uncommitted about voting for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department until he had \"intense\" conversations with the White House over the weekend.",
      "\"I want to thank VP JD specifically for his honest counsel,\" Cassidy said in a post on X as he and fellow members of the Senate Finance Committee assembled for their vote Tuesday. \"With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes.\"",
      "Sen. Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, also said he had extensive conversations with the vice president about confirming former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence.",
      "\"We identified \u2014 after looking at her hearing transcript, after a personal visit in the office, after a lot of answers to questions for the record \u2014 some gaps, and there was certain language I wanted her to embrace and her answers to reassure me that those national security gaps would be filled. And I worked with Vice President Vance, and he got me those the requested answers,\" Young told reporters.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, another prolific swing vote, has also complimented Vance and said she has spoken with him about policy.",
      "\"I think all of us who have served with JD have had conversations with him,\" she said. \"I've talked to him, for example, about the difference between our relationships with Canada, which is very important in my state, versus our relationship with Mexico and China.\"",
      "Vance introduced commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick at his confirmation hearing last month. And when it came to Trump's embattled nominee for defense secretary, Vance not only ginned up support for Pete Hegseth but also cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm him.",
      "Vance is particularly close to Senate Majority Whip John Barasso, who is responsible for counting votes and is considered an integral part of the team. While he only served in the Senate for two years before becoming vice president, Vance built key relationships in the chamber, and Republicans members view him a trusted colleague. He has been working the phones and talking to senators about their questions and concerns.",
      "But Vance is also not afraid to exert public pressure, too. He put Republican senators on notice last Wednesday after Kennedy and Gabbard testified before the committees that would vote on advancing their nominations.",
      "\"In their own way, both Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. represent parts of the new coalition in our party. To say they're unwelcome in the cabinet is to insult those new voters,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"To reject their confirmation is to reject the idea that President Trump decides his cabinet.\"",
      "Sources close to Vance say he won't have a traditional portfolio like other vice presidents, who are often tasked with taking on less desirable initiatives. Mr. Trump previously assigned former Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force in late February 2020 before the pandemic swept over the country.",
      "Instead, Vance is expected to be a jack of all trades, rather than serving in any specific area. An adviser close to Vance stressed that he is going to be a \"generalist\" focusing on all areas of policy and carrying out Mr. Trump's plans.",
      "Most importantly, Vance will serve as the node between the White House and Capitol Hill, focused on making sure no one is slowing down the Trump agenda in Congress.",

    "summary": "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, recording as many 1,000 arrests on some days.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is releasing some migrant detainees, in some cases dozens per day, as space in its detention system has exceeded maximum capacity amid a spike in arrests by the agency under President Trump, internal government statistics obtained by CBS News show.",
      "On Tuesday morning, space inside ICE detention facilities was at 109% capacity, with the agency holding close to 42,000 migrant detainees, despite having, on paper, a 38,521-bed capacity in its network of for-profit prisons and county jails, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security data. More than half of those in ICE custody were initially arrested along the southern border, the figures show.",
      "On Monday, ICE released roughly 160 migrants from its custody, the figures show, an indication that the Trump administration, faced with the same operational and legal challenges on immigration enforcement that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican presidents, is being forced to release some detainees. Those released can be fitted by ICE with ankle monitors, to track their movements.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, ICE acknowledged that its \"enhanced\" operations have yielded \"a significant number of arrests of criminal aliens that require greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"We are exploring every solution including working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and our state and local law enforcement partners, asking Congress for increased funding, and scrutinizing case files to quickly remove criminal aliens with executable final orders of removal from Department of Justice immigration judges,\" the agency said.",
      "ICE also said some immigration laws require it to release certain migrants, noting that those released remain under the agency's supervision.",
      "Earlier this week, NBC News reported ICE had released some migrants recently arrested under the Trump administration.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, recording as many 1,000 arrests on some days, compared to the 312 daily average during former President Joe Biden's last year in office. The Trump administration has rescinded several Biden-era limits on ICE arrests, giving the agency a broad mandate to go after most of those in the U.S. illegally, including unauthorized migrants without criminal records.",
      "But those arrested by ICE often have to be detained for days and weeks \u2014 and in some cases, months \u2014 before the agency completes all the paperwork and legal process necessary to deport them. Sometimes, those migrants can't be deported because their home countries do not accept them, and the Supreme Court has limited detention in those cases. In other cases, judges grant them relief from deportation.",
      "Because of the limited space at existing holding facilities, ICE is planning to dramatically expand its detention capacity as it seeks to fulfill what Mr. Trump has promised will be the largest mass deportation campaign in U.S. history.",
      "On one hand, the agency is seeking to expand its own network of detention centers. An internal government memo last month indicated that ICE was eyeing 14 new detention sites that could hold as many as 1,000 detainees each, as well as four larger facilities with 10,000 beds each.",
      "But ICE is also turning to other agencies to augment its detention capabilities. The Department of Defense has already authorized ICE to detain migrants at a Space Force base in Colorado, and the Guantanamo Bay Naval base received its first group of migrant detainees on Tuesday after Mr. Trump directed officials to convert facilities there into a massive immigration detention center.",
      "Over the weekend, Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, asked county sheriffs to help federal immigration officers arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants, Reuters reported.",
      "The Trump administration has also considered holding ICE detainees inside large tent sites, known as \"soft-sided\" facilities, that were set up by Border Patrol along the southern border to temporarily house and process migrant families and children, two officials familiar with the proposal told CBS News.",
      "It's unclear whether that plan will be implemented. It could face significant operational and safety challenges as soft-sided facilities were designed for short-term processing and are not as secure as ICE detention centers.",
      "But, unlike ICE, Border Patrol's detention space is well under capacity. On Tuesday morning, Customs and Border Protection had fewer than 2,000 migrants in its custody, using roughly 9% of its 21,000-person detention capacity, according to the internal DHS data.",
      "That is mainly due to the relative calm at the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings are nearing a five-year low. In January, Border Patrol processed nearly 30,000 migrants who crossed the southern border illegally, the lowest level since May 2020, internal government figures show.",

      "Washington \u2014 A group of transgender minors and their families filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that challenges President Trump's executive action restricting access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "The suit\u00a0was filed in federal district court in Maryland on behalf of two 12 year-olds who identify as transgender and five transgender teenagers who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, along with LGBTQ advocacy groups. They allege that Mr. Trump's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status.",
      "\"The Executive Orders were issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of preventing transgender people from expressing a gender identity different from their sex designated at birth \u2014 and expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people who, by definition, have a gender identity that does not align with their sex designated at birth,\" lawyers for the families wrote in their complaint.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure follows executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to promote gender ideology and declares U.S. policy as recognizing two sexes, male and female.",
      "Half of the states have in recent years passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July. The Trump administration is likely to reverse the government's position in the case.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the seven transgender individuals argues that Mr. Trump's executive orders involving gender identity are unlawful and unconstitutional because he is usurping Congress' authority by unilaterally seeking to withhold funding from medical institutions, providers and researchers that have already received congressional approval.",
      "\"Under our Constitution, it is Congress, not the president, who is vested with the power of the purse,\" they argued in their filing. \"The president does not have unilateral power to withhold federal funds that have been previously authorized by Congress and signed into law, and the president does not have the power to impose his own conditions on the use of funds when Congress has not delegated to him the power to do so.\"",
      "The challengers warn that Mr. Trump's directive to cut off federal funding for medical providers that offer gender-affirming care has already had \"concrete and immediate effects.\" In one instance, Children's National based in Washington, D.C., announced last week \u2014 on the heels of the president's order \u2014 that it would be pausing its provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth.",
      "In another instance, one of the plaintiffs, a 17-year-old from Virginia identified in filings as W.G., was set to continue receiving hormone therapy from doctors at Virginia Commonwealth University Health and Children's Hospital, but had her appointment canceled. The hospital receives more than $100 million in federal grants, according to the complaint, and announced it would be suspending gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 19 in response to Mr. Trump's order.",
      "NYU Langone Health in New York City, which received more than $5.6 million in federal grants over the last 12 months, treats several of the transgender youth involved in the lawsuit but canceled planned procedures for two of them, according to the filing.",
      "\"By directing agencies to withhold all federal funding from entities that 'promote gender ideology' and provide gender affirming medical care to patients under nineteen, the Gender Identity and Denial of Care Orders threaten the ability of medical institutions and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to provide essential health care to their communities, train the next generation of physicians, and support research to address this country's greatest health challenges,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote.",
      "They are asking the court to declare Mr. Trump's orders are unlawful and block their enforcement.",
      "The president has issued a slew of executive orders in his first weeks back in the White House covering a wide range of issues, from immigration to energy to gender identity. Many have already been the subject of court challenges, and more are expected as federal agencies begin taking steps to implement Mr. Trump's directives.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard survived a crucial Senate Intelligence Committee vote on Tuesday after her nomination to be President Trump's director of national intelligence appeared to be in jeopardy.",
      "In a 9-8 vote, the Senate Intelligence Committee advanced Gabbard's nomination to the full Senate. The vote fell along party lines.",
      "Republicans on the panel who were seen as potential \"no\" votes began to drop their objections Monday, with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine saying that Gabbard had addressed her concerns and shared her vision of downsizing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana announced Tuesday he would back Gabbard after he secured \"commitments that will advance our national security.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's choice to lead the intelligence community was seen as one of the most vulnerable nominees heading into her confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, when she was grilled on a number of controversial positions she has taken over the years. She faced skepticism from senators over her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her past push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, her comments about Russia's war in Ukraine and her past opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
      "The most contentious moments of the hearing came as she was repeatedly pressed by Republican and Democratic senators on whether she would characterize Snowden as a \"traitor.\"",
      "Gabbard declined to directly answer the question, responding each time that \"Edward Snowden broke the law.\" She never said that he was a \"traitor\" and at one point seemed to defend his actions, telling the panel that he had exposed \"egregious illegal and unconstitutional programs\" that led to reforms. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Gabbard vowed to pardon Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and later Russia, where he lives in exile, after the leak.",
      "\"I do not agree with or support all of the information and intelligence that he released, nor the way in which he did it,\" Gabbard told senators.",
      "Gabbard also sought to alleviate concerns about her criticisms of FISA Section 702, which allows the U.S. to collect foreign communications without a warrant. U.S. officials say it's crucial to protecting national security because it helps disrupt terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and espionage activities. It does not allow U.S. citizens to be targeted, but their communications can be swept up when they are in contact with a targeted foreigner.",
      "Gabbard told senators during her confirmation hearing last week it was \"essential\" to national security, years after she tried to repeal the controversial law.",
      "\"There are a number of areas that we would be blind from a national security perspective without this capability,\" she said. \"It also must exist next to having safeguards in place to ensure Americans' civil liberties are protected.\"",
      "The former congresswoman from Hawaii has also faced criticism for her comments about the war in Ukraine and meeting with Assad, then doubting that his regime used chemical weapons against civilians.",
      "At her hearing, Gabbard conceded that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"started the war in Ukraine\" and that her skepticism of the chemical weapons attack was based on \"conflicting information and evidence\" that she was given at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs, putting the former congressman and Iraq War veteran at the helm of a department that provides crucial care to America's veterans.",
      "Collins, a former Air Force chaplain, was confirmed on a 77-23 vote, becoming the latest addition to President Trump's Cabinet.",
      "\"We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our active duty servicemembers, veterans, and military families to ensure they have the support they need,\" Mr. Trump said in a November statement announcing Collins' nomination.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs manages a more than $350 billion budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals nationwide. It also manages national cemeteries and works closely with the Defense Department on personnel matters.",
      "Collins has promised to cut regulations across the department and elevate the quality of care for veterans.",
      "The challenges facing the department have evolved in recent years, with a younger generation of veterans bringing new health challenges from their service in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",
      "\"I'm an Iraq War veteran. I understand burn pits because I slept next to one for many months,\" Collins said in his opening remarks during his January confirmation hearing. Collins said that he understand the challenges facing veterans today who \"went time and time again, deployment after deployment\" to conflict zones.",
      "Collins served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021. He has been an outspoken conservative since his time in the Georgia state legislature and was a close Trump ally during the president's first term. He ran for Senate in 2020 but lost the Republican primary to Kelly Loeffler, a major GOP donor who Trump has tapped to lead the U.S. Small Business Association.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called Collins a \"friend\" who has \"an engaging personality that attracts people to what he's working on.\"",
      "\"It's not that they're better doctors or better psychiatrists or better nurses or technicians. It's that they're empathetic,\" Cramer said. \"While they appreciate access to community care, they appreciate the empathy of a fellow veteran, and Doug brings that. But, guys, he's a chaplain. I mean, come on, how perfect is that?\"",
      "Collins' nomination sailed through the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in a 18-1 vote. The lone dissenter, Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said she was concerned that Collins would limit access to reproductive care like IVF or abortion for veterans.",
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, said she had a productive conversation with Collins during his confirmation hearing but pressed him on whether he'd commit to working with Congress to \"strengthen and refine\" the department \"rather than resorting to privatization.\"",
      "Collins said he would be focused on addressing wait times and increasing preventative care.",

    "summary": "The Senate Finance Committee advanced Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee advanced Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination Tuesday, moving forward with his confirmation to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after a pair of fiery hearings last week that left his approval on shaky ground.",
      "The committee voted 14 to 13 to advance Kennedy in a party-line vote.",
      "Though the bulk of Republicans on the committee were expected to support advancing Kennedy's nomination, Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and medical doctor, expressed concern over the president's pick for HHS secretary during RFK Jr.'s confirmation hearings.",
      "Cassidy said last week that he had been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination because he fears RFK Jr., who has raised doubts about vaccines in the past, could undermine faith in vaccines. Cassidy spoke to Kennedy on Sunday, according to a person familiar with their conversation, though the Louisiana senator did not disclose how he planned to vote following their conversation.",
      "But Cassidy, who is up for reelection in 2026, ultimately opted to support advancing Kennedy's nomination on Tuesday.",
      "Moments ahead of the vote, Cassidy announced that he would support Kennedy in a post on X, saying he had \"very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend and even this morning,\" while thanking Vice President JD Vance for his \"honest counsel.\"",
      "\"With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Kennedy appeared before the finance committee for a confirmation hearing last week, before testifying to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions the following day. During both appearances, Democrats on the committees \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 grilled the longtime environmental lawyer and activist on his stances on vaccines, abortion, and other issues.",
      "President Trump's pick for HHS secretary has faced scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans, alike. Though Kennedy, 71, initially sought the Democratic presidential nomination and has close ties to the party as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy, he dropped out of the presidential race to endorse Mr. Trump in August, and has long been the recipient of the Democratic establishment's ire.",
      "Amid the pushback, some had looked to possible support from Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. But Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that he was \"not particularly happy\" with Kennedy's presentation before the Senate committees last week.",
      "Without support from Democrats on the committee, which has a one-member GOP advantage, Cassidy's opposition threatened to tank a favorable recommendation for advancing Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, two Democrats on the committee, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, raised alarm about possible conflicts of interest in recent days, penning a letter to Kennedy concerning his potential to profit from vaccine-related litigation. Paired with his long-held stances on vaccine safety, the senators said the possible conflicts give them \"grave concern\" about his ability to serve as HHS secretary.",
      "Kennedy has earned referral fees from a Los Angeles personal injury law firm, Wisner Baum, for years. The firm is currently suing Merck concerning warnings about the safety of the HPV vaccine. Kennedy agreed to divest his interests in the cases he has referred to Wisner Baum to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\" The senators noted in their letter that Kennedy in his written response to committee questions indicated he was divesting the interest to one of his adult sons \u2014 a detail which they called \"troubling.\"",
      "\"The arrangement outlined in your Ethics Agreement Amendment is plainly inadequate, as it would appear to allow an immediate family member to benefit financially from your position as Secretary,\" the senators wrote, adding that \"vaccine-related decisions\" that Kennedy could make as HHS secretary \"could result in significant financial compensation for your family.\"",
      "The Democrats also asked Kennedy to commit in writing to recuse himself from all vaccine-related communications and decisions and pledge not to litigate cases involving vaccines or have a financial interest in the cases for at least four years after leaving office. Kennedy said during Wednesday's hearing that he would \"comply with all the ethical guidelines.\"",
      "With the advancement out of committee, the fight over Kennedy's confirmation will move to the Senate floor, where his approval isn't guaranteed. Republicans can afford to lose just three votes to confirm him without support from across the aisle, with Vice President J.D. Vance serving as a tie-breaker.",
      "The developments come as Senate Republicans have pushed to quickly confirm Mr. Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and top administration posts, with appointees like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sailing to confirmation, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eked by with a 51-50 vote on his confirmation.",
      "The president decried pushback from Democrats regarding his nominees in a post on Truth Social Sunday, saying \"no matter how good and well qualified someone is, they are taking maximum time for approval \u2014 and laughing about it.\"",
      "\"Republicans must GET TOUGH \u2014 AND MUST GET TOUGH VERY FAST,\" Trump said. \"We need our Nominees NOW, for the Safety and Good of our Country!\"",

    "summary": "After meeting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, El Salvador's president has offered to house U.S. deportees and even American inmates in his country's \"mega-prison.\"",
    "story": [
      "San Salvador, El Salvador \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept and incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including criminals with American citizenship currently imprisoned in the U.S. President Nayib Bukele confirmed the offer in a social media post, saying El Salvador was willing to rehouse deportees and American prisoners in a two-year-old \"mega-prison\" he had built as potent symbol of his crackdown on criminal gangs.",
      "Bukele \"has agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\" Rubio said after meeting the Salvadoran leader at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said of migrants of all nationalities detained in the United States. \"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're U.S. citizens or legal residents.\"",
      "Bukele confirmed the offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.\"",
      "He said his country would accept only \"only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee\" that he said \"would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "Elon Musk, the billionaire working with Mr. Trump to remake the federal government, responded on his X platform, \"Great idea!!\"",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens, and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "CBS News reported\u00a0last month that El Salvador had agreed to accept U.S. deportations of \"criminal illegal migrants from any country,\" including members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet President Trump's demands for a major crackdown on\u00a0immigration.",
      "The State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as \"harsh and dangerous.\" On its current country information webpage it says, \"In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.\"",
      "Unlike many of the country's prisons, however, the massive facility known as CECOT that Bukele referred to after his talks with Rubio remains more than half-empty, according to the French news agency AFP, with capacity for 40,000 inmates but only about 15,000 currently estimated to be incarcerated there.",
      "Formally called the Terrorism Confinement Center, CECOT is surrounded by high concrete walls and it sits on the edge of a jungle about 45 miles southeast of San Salvador. According to AFP, inmates at the prison are only permitted to leave their cells for court hearings, which are conducted via video link, or for 30 minutes of daily exercise in an enclosed hall.",
      "Rubio arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador. His tour is taking place at a time of turmoil in Washington over the status of the government's main foreign development agency.",
      "The Trump administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \"safe third country\" agreement. Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \"safe third country\" plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington's \"backyard to dump the garbage.\"",
      "After meeting with Bukele, Rubio signed a memorandum of understanding with his Salvadoran counterpart to advance U.S.-El Salvador civil nuclear cooperation. The document could lead to a more formal deal on cooperation in nuclear power and medicine that the U.S. has with numerous countries.",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\"Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \"It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it's not good for anyone.\"",
      "Monday's deportation flight came as Mr. Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters after Musk announced Mr. Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades - although its new status will likely be challenged in court - and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Mr. Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Mr. Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\"I understand that it's a delicate issue in Panama,\" Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \"We don't want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\" he said. \"I don't believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it'll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\"",
      "But back in Washington, Mr. Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China's involved with the Panama Canal. They won't be for long and that's the way it has to be.\"",
      "\"We either want it back, or we're going to get something very strong, or we're going to take it back,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"And China will be dealt with.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former USAID Global Health director  Dr. Atul Gawande criticized the Trump administration's plan to merge the United States Agency for International Development into the State Department and the funding freezes that are putting key aid programs in jeopardy. Asked about the changes, he said, \"It's not an overhaul. It's a destruction.\"",
      "Gawande, a surgeon, medical professor and best-selling author, told CBS News on Monday that the \"destruction\" began a week ago after the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance. The memo was walked back days later and the ordered freeze has been halted by a federal court, but programs appear to still be halted or in limbo.",
      "\"You're talking about 20 million people in the global HIV program\u00a0that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive,\" Gawande said. \"You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 49 countries.\"",
      "\"There is a great deal of harm being done, and this change to take away the independent status [of USAID] is just a nail in the coffin after a purge of personnel that has decimated the agency,\" Gawande said.",
      "Other former USAID workers expressed similar concerns.",
      "Maura Reap, who was a USAID contractor with the Bureau for Global Health until last week, had just arrived on a two-week assignment in Ethiopia when Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0ordered a pause\u00a0on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. During the first week of the assignment, Reap was supposed to be focused on designing a project supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Reap, whose expertise is in mental health, said the program had been planned for months.",
      "\"We had some meetings over the weekend, and there was just a lot of uncertainty,\" Reap said in an interview with CBS News. \"It was like a slow train wreck.\"",
      "Eventually, she got an email saying she had to return to Washington, D.C. While she was in the air, she and her two colleagues had received termination notices.",
      "\"This terrible waste of a [temporary duty travel] with all the planning and investment that had gone into it, and it was for nothing,\" she said.",
      "Gawande also hit back at Mr. Trump and\u00a0billionaire Elon Musk's comments, who have both slammed the agency, with Mr. Trump recently saying the USAID is \"run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\" Musk said the agency \"is not an apple with a worm in it, what we have actually, just a ball of worms.\"",
      "Gawande countered, \"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration is expected to announce details in the coming days about the disruption to the USAID, a 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries. The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Mr. Trump has vowed to cut the size of the federal government, and USAID has been a recent target of his and Musk's, who is tasked with leading the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Earlier Monday, the White House released a list of examples of what it deemed wasteful spending by USAID in recent years. Democratic lawmakers, however, have warned that any attempt to change USAID's structure and funding would require an act of Congress.",
      "Reap expressed dismay that \"somebody who's not even elected can come in and just take this 60-year-old institution that has accomplished so much ... and to have so much disregard and to take it and to turn it and to throw it on his back and to say, this is not \u2014 this is, we're throwing it out.\"",
      "Gawande said it's \"dangerous for the country to denigrate\" the agency, saying it's the country's \"largest civilian operational capacity for advancing\" the work of the U.S. abroad.",
      "\"We're talking about world-class expertise. For example, the malaria program. Two-thirds have been fired, and the activity shutdown includes one of the global experts in malaria for us. How does that make us safer? How does that make us stronger?\" Gawande said.",
      "Reap also argued that the work USAID does saves lives and supports policies that benefit the United States.",
      "\"Because, I mean, there's so many things related to the work we do,\" Reap said. \"Stopping outbreaks, reducing the push and pull factors for migration at our southern \u2014 at our borders. The work we do counters extremism, and it leads \u2014 it contributes to stable communities by the work we're doing by keeping people healthy so they can contribute to their communities.\"",
      "Gawande noted, \"Every administration goes through an overhaul that says they want to change policy, they want to change some direction, but you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process. There was no need to close down all of its functions, which is harming people.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",

They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",

      "The study authors, all affiliated with Canada's University of British Columbia, said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights. The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",

      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

    "summary": "Starliner co-pilot Sunita Williams is now the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",
      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",
      "President Trump earlier this week blamed their long stay in space on the Biden administration and said that he'd asked SpaceX owner Elon Musk to bring Williams and Wilmore back home as soon as possible.",
      "But the astronauts are not stranded. Their ride home has been docked to the station since last September and could bring them back to Earth in short order if NASA so ordered.",
      "But that would cause major disruptions to U.S. research aboard the lab because only a single NASA astronaut \u2014 Don Pettit \u2014 would remain aboard the station with two Russian crewmates until the Crew 10 fliers arrive around the end of March.",

      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",

      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

      "But it has faced scrutiny due to a surge in shipments claiming the exemption in recent years.",

    "summary": "In a news conferrence with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump said the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip\" and \"own it.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip\" and \"own it,\" continuing to promote the idea that the Palestinian people should live elsewhere.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose comments came at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Palestinians in Gaza \"should not go through a process of rebuilding\" and that they had \"lived a miserable existence there.\" Earlier in the afternoon, during a meeting with Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the Palestinians should \"resettle permanently\" in \"nice homes\" somewhere else.",
      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings \u2014\u00a0 level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\"",
      "\"Just can't go back,\" he continued. \"If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.\"",
      "Netanyahu, who is the first foreign leader to visit Mr. Trump during his second term, said of the president's idea, \"We're talking about it. He's exploring it with his people, with his staff. I think it's something that could change history, and it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\"",
      "On whether U.S. troops would be sent to Gaza, the president said, \"As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that.\"",
      "\"We're going to take over that piece,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it'll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.\"",
      "The president was asked by a reporter what authority he has to take over a sovereign territory, and he replied that he's studied the matter closely for months.",
      "\"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president said his decision about taking over Gaza \"was not a decision made lightly,\" and he claimed he's received praise from other leaders in the Middle East, though he did not identify any by name. Two sources said later that top Trump aides knew in advance of Netanyahu's visit that the president planned to announce the proposal regarding U.S. ownership of Gaza.",
      "Leaders of several of the most powerful Arab nations previously said they strongly opposed any suggestion that residents of Gaza be resettled in other countries.",
      "Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said in a statement reported by the Reuters news agency Wednesday that the kingdom \"rejects any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land\" and wouldn't establish diplomatic ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman affirmed the kingdom's position in \"a clear and explicit manner\" that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances, the statement said.",
      "Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri was also quick to dismiss the idea out of hand, telling Reuters the president's \"remarks about his desire to control Gaza are ridiculous and absurd, and any ideas of this kind are capable of igniting the region.\"",
      "Hamas also called Mr. Trump \"racist\" and said his plan aims to \"eliminate the Palestinian cause,\" according to Agency France-Presse.",
      "Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat and the first Palestinian-American to serve in Congress, was blunt, asserting in a post on X that Trump was \"openly calling for ethnic cleansing.\"",
      "In the past, Mr. Trump has voiced support for a \"realistic two-state solution.\" Gaza, a 139-square-mile strip of land that shares borders with Israel and Egypt, has been fought over for years. Palestinians have been refugees for decades, since Israel gained control of it in the 1967 Six-Day War with Egypt, Jordan and Syria.",
      "Asked who would eventually live in Gaza once it's rebuilt, Mr. Trump said it should be an international place.",
      "\"I envision world people living there, the world's people,\" he said, adding that the residents should be \"representatives from all over the world, Palestinians, also.\" He said it would be \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump opened the news conference by reinforcing his warm relationship with Netanyahu, saying they had forged a successful partnership in his first term. He claimed that the last four years \u2014 under former President Joe Biden \u2014 had not seen as many successes.",
      "He claimed \"the grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East \u2026 the horrors of Oct. 7 would never have happened if I were president.\"",
      "In the wake of the massacre of Israeli civilians in 2023, however, Netanyahu praised Biden \"for his vital support for Israel.\"",
      "Netanyahu suggested Mr. Trump may be unconventional, but he has good ideas, and they work well together.",
      "\"After the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, 'You know, he's right,'\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu told reporters he found he had something else in common with Mr. Trump, too \u2014 he said Iran has tried to kill them both.",
      "Trump, Netanyahu meet in Oval Office before news conference",
      "Seated next to Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump repeatedly said he doesn't think Palestinians want to return to Gaza and said that he thinks Jordan, Egypt and other nations would accept Palestinians, even though they've said they won't.",
      "\"They are not gonna want to go back to Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that Palestinians would only \"end up dying\" there, and suggesting Palestinians should have a permanent settlement elsewhere.",
      "\"If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death, like what's happening in Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And right now you have in Gaza a very dangerous situation in terms of explosives all over the place, in terms of tunnels that nobody knows who's in the tunnel. The whole thing is a mess.\"",
      "The president said other \"rich\" nations should pay for a new home for Palestinians, although he did not expand on this suggestion.",
      "Netanyahu largely allowed Mr. Trump to speak. One reporter asked the Israeli prime minister whether former President Joe Biden or Mr. Trump is more responsible for the hostage and ceasefire deal.",
      "\"I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,\" Netanyahu replied.",
      "The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered in part by the U.S., continues to hold so far. Dual citizen Keith Siegel was the first American to be released since the implementation began last month, although other Americans have been released before.",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu said he would discuss \"victory over Hamas\" with Mr. Trump, as well as countering Iran and building on diplomatic relationships with Arab nations.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday that he has \"no guarantees that the peace is going to hold.\"",
      "The president's meeting with Netanyahu being his first with a foreign leader signals how the Trump White House views the U.S.-Israel relationship.",
      "\"Trump is going to continue his support for our great ally, Israel,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Fox News Tuesday.",
      "Waltz said the U.S. and Israel have \"more to go\" in terms of returning Americans held hostage. And the national security adviser said the U.S. has to think \"realistically\" about rebuilding Gaza.",
      "\"I would push back on the characterization of cleaning out Gaza,\" Waltz told reporters Tuesday. \"I think President Trump is looking at this from a humanitarian standpoint. You have these people that are sitting with literally thousands of unexploded ordnance and piles of rubble. You know, at some point we have to look realistically. How do you rebuild Gaza? What does that look like? What's the timeline? I think we, a lot of people, were looking at very unrealistic timelines. We're talking 10, 15, years, not the five years. And so that is what, that's what we have to work through. That's part of what we'll work through with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\"",
      "Netanyahu last met with Mr. Trump in July at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, while Mr. Trump was still a presidential candidate.",
      "Netanyahu congratulated former President Joe Biden on his win in 2020, something that Mr. Trump long held against him. But the two have worked to repair the relationship in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Pam Bondi as attorney general, installing a key ally of President Trump's to take the helm of the Justice Department.",
      "Bondi's nomination for attorney general was approved by the upper chamber 54 to 46, with one Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joining all Republicans in voting to confirm her. She will take over as the nation's top law enforcement officer as Mr. Trump has pledged to end what he calls the weaponization of the Justice Department and threatened to target his critics.",
      "During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Bondi said she would \"not politicize\" the department and said \"justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country.\"",
      "\"If confirmed, I will work to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"Under my watch, the partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "In the days since Mr. Trump began his second term in office, the Senate has been working to confirm his Cabinet picks. The GOP-led upper chamber installed the top members of his national security team first and now is moving to approve the remaining nominees who will lead federal departments.",

      "As attorney general, Bondi will oversee a sprawling department that includes numerous law enforcement components, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Both agencies have often been the target of attacks by Mr. Trump. The president selected another staunch defender, Kash Patel, to lead the FBI.",
      "Bondi will also have the power to investigate the federal probes involving Mr. Trump that were overseen by former special counsel Jack Smith. Smith resigned from the role before the president returned to office, and the two cases brought against Mr. Trump were dismissed because of longstanding Justice Department policy that precludes the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Now, with Mr. Trump back in the White House, his administration has been overseeing the ouster of certain Justice Department employees. Acting Attorney General James McHenry, selected by the president to temporarily lead the department, fired roughly a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for Smith because \"he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official said.",

      "FBI supervisors have also received questionnaires for certain agents in their field offices that contain questions about their possible work on the Jan. 6 cases, such as whether they participated in a search, if they made any arrests or testified in court.",
      "Bondi has previously suggested that the Justice Department prosecutors who were involved in the cases against Mr. Trump would face their own investigation and has repeated the president's claim that there is a so-called deep state of career government employees working to undermine him.",
      "\"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them,\" she told Fox News after he was charged in 2023.",
      "Bondi takes the helm of the Justice Department without the federal prosecution experience that her predecessors have had. She served two terms as Florida's attorney general, during which her office led lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act and former President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",

      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",
      "Tarrio, who had been serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy tied to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol building, was pardoned by President Trump after his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, providing them with the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow-and-black laurel wreath symbol.",
      "\"This is our time to stand up, to be very clear to the Proud Boys and their ilk that we came here fighting, that we have never ever capitulated to the violent whims of white supremacist groups,\" Rev. William H. Lamar IV, pastor of the Metropolitan AME Church, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they thought we would be afraid, they were wrong. There are many people with us and who stand with us.\"",
      "The Metropolitan AME Church, which was founded in 1838 and has hosted speakers including Frederick Douglass and Eleanor Roosevelt, can now collect funds from sales of Proud Boys merchandise as well as its membership dues, people familiar with the case said. The church can also block the Proud Boys from using the trademark, they said.",
      "The notoriety of the Proud Boys' name likely helped the group in recruitment, which means blocking use of its trademark could both hurt the group's ability to sell merchandise and recruit new members, they added.",

      "Vance has proven to be essential in getting President Trump's most controversial cabinet nominees cleared through committees to a full Senate confirmation vote. Multiple Republican senators who were on the fence about supporting some of the president's picks have said it was Vance, their former Senate colleague, who helped them get them to yes on some of President Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees.",

And I worked with Vice President Vance, and he got me those the requested answers,\" Young told reporters.",

While he only served in the Senate for two years before becoming vice president, Vance built key relationships in the chamber, and Republicans members view him a trusted colleague. He has been working the phones and talking to senators about their questions and concerns.",

To say they're unwelcome in the cabinet is to insult those new voters,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"To reject their confirmation is to reject the idea that President Trump decides his cabinet.\"",

    "title": "Trump says Canada tariffs would fight fentanyl, though it's not a major source",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Drug policy researcher Jonathan Caulkins said there were 21 large fentanyl seizures at the Mexican border for every one along the Canadian border.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said part of his motivation for imposing now-paused tariffs on Canada was to force the country to crack down on illicit fentanyl trafficking \u2014 but very little of the synthetic opioid enters the U.S. through its northern border.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said\u00a0the tariffs, announced Feb. 1 on Mexico, Canada and China, were \"for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country.\" Mr. Trump said in a statement that it was \"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been paused for at least one month following negotiations, while a 10% tariff on China remains in place.",
      "The tariffs were also meant to compel the countries to take further action to stop undocumented immigrants from entering the U.S. and to narrow their trade surplus.",
      "Here's what to know about fentanyl and other drug trafficking over the United States' northern border.",
      "How much fentanyl is seized at Canadian border?",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized just 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last year, according to statistics released publicly by the agency. Meanwhile, about 21,100 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the Mexican border.",
      "Drug policy researcher Jonathan Caulkins conducted an analysis looking at large fentanyl seizures \u2014 those of more than a kilogram of powder or of 1,000 pills or more \u2014 and found such incidents in just two counties bordering Canada. One county is home to the city of Detroit, and Caulkins said the drug seizures conducted there are proportionate to its population. Only one area \u2014 Whatcom County, Washington \u2014 had an amount of drug seizures disproportionate to its population, Caulkins said.",
      "In general, Canada sees far fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl than the United States.",
      "About 49,100 people died from opioid overdoses in Canada between 2016 and 2024, with most of those deaths involving fentanyl, Canadian officials said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0estimated there were more than 74,000 fentanyl-related deaths in 2023 alone.",
      "How is fentanyl entering the United States?",
      "Most fentanyl enters the United States through Mexico, CBS News has previously reported. The\u00a0U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0has said Mexican cartels are \"at the heart\" of the United States' fentanyl crisis.",
      "Caulkins' analysis found 21 large fentanyl seizures along the Mexican border for every such seizure along the Canadian border.",
      "Often, illicit drugs are transported over the southern border by U.S. citizens passing through CBP checkpoints, Caulkins said. The U.S. citizens are usually hired by smuggler groups, which have in turn been hired by cartels and drug manufacturers.",
      "\"In general, it's not like it's a Sinaloa cartel employee walking across the border,\" Caulkins said. U.S. citizens are less likely to be seen as suspicious, he said, and they face fewer obstacles during the actual border crossing.",
      "Precursor chemicals at the border",
      "Precursor chemicals, or the ingredients used to make illicit drugs, have been seized in both Canada and Mexico, as well as within the United States. Precursor chemicals are largely manufactured in China and shipped overseas, usually to Mexico. The fentanyl is then produced, again typically in Mexico, and brought into the United States for distribution.",
      "In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of chemical precursors and fentanyl.",
      "In November 2024, Canadian police said they had dismantled the most sophisticated drug \"super lab\"\u00a0that they had ever seen in the country. They said they seized a \"massive\" amount of precursor chemicals from the facility in British Columbia, as well as 54 kilograms, or about 110 pounds, of fentanyl, along with other drugs.",
      "Police said they believed the lab was a mass production site where fentanyl and methamphetamine were made so they could be distributed in Canada and internationally. Officials did not say what countries the drugs may have been exported to.",
      "In December 2024, Canada said its health agency would create a \"Chemical Precursor Risk Management Unit\" that could \"provide better insight into\" the chemicals and their distribution channels. The unit would also be able to \"enhance monitoring and surveillance\" and allow for \"timely law enforcement action\" in connection to these chemicals. The unit was just one of several ways Canada said it would be fighting the fentanyl crisis.",
      "Health Canada is also set to accelerate its regulatory process for banning precursors \"so that border and law enforcement can take swift action to prevent their illegal importation and use.\"",

      "Two groups of anonymous FBI agents who worked on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot investigation and other federal probes tied to President Trump are suing the federal government over the Justice Department's plans to review the FBI's workforce and scrutinize agents who may have worked on the sensitive investigations, according to two separate lawsuits filed monday.",

      "In response, on Sunday, agents across the country were asked to complete questionnaires about their involvement in the Jan. 6 and Trump probes as part of a Justice Department evaluation of the workforce.",
      "According to a U.S. official familiar with the process, the FBI subsequently turned over the requested agent and personnel information to Justice Department leadership on Tuesday afternoon. Information like employee ID numbers and titles of 5,000 individuals were on the list, the official said.",
      "There is no indication yet about what actions the Justice Department may take against anyone on the compiled lists and so far, a handful of senior career officials have been fired, while rank-and-file agents remain on the job.",
      "The nine unnamed FBI agents who filed the first lawsuit on Tuesday alleged, \"The purpose for this list is to identify agents to be terminated or to suffer other adverse employment action.\"",
      "Their attorneys asked for a jury trial and wrote that the agents feared \"this list might be published by allies of President Trump, thus placing themselves and their families in immediate danger of retribution.\"",
      "The second group of agents and the FBI Agents Association alleged social media activity indicated some charged during the Jan. 6 probe who have since been pardoned by the president, \"link to each other in posts promoting violence and insurrection against law enforcement agents.\"",
      "The Justice Department has not \"made any reasonable efforts to ensure that the maintenance and public release of the records at issue in this case are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for agency purposes,\" the lawsuit said, adding later, \"This bell cannot be unrung, and once the Plaintiffs' personal information is released it will be eternally available on social media.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "McHenry also recently instructed the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., to fire certain prosecutors who had been\u00a0 assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a separate memo dated Jan. 31, and reviewed by CBS News. That decision, which mostly affected contract lawyers brought in on an interim basis to prosecute Jan. 6 cases, is not subject to the new lawsuit.",

      "The personnel moves make good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house at the Justice Department. Soon after taking office, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 16:54:21 -0500",
    "summary": "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that Tesla CEO Musk is categorized as a special government employee.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk is categorized as a \"special government employee\" through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a cost-cutting initiative created by President Trump to find ways to trim federal spending.",
      "Musk's employee status was confirmed by White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Monday, although she added that she wasn't sure whether the Tesla CEO has gained security clearance.",
      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",
      "That lawsuit pointed out that, at the time of its filing, Musk's status with the federal government was unclear.",
      "\"The Trump administration has not publicly revealed whether Mr. Musk has been made an officer or employee of the U.S. government or remains a private citizen,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Trump administration also has not publicly revealed the employment status of other individuals who are part of DOGE.\"",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of transgender minors and their families filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that challenges President Trump's executive action restricting access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "The suit\u00a0was filed in federal district court in Maryland on behalf of two 12 year-olds who identify as transgender and five transgender teenagers who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, along with LGBTQ advocacy groups. They allege that Mr. Trump's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status.",
      "\"The Executive Orders were issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of preventing transgender people from expressing a gender identity different from their sex designated at birth \u2014 and expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people who, by definition, have a gender identity that does not align with their sex designated at birth,\" lawyers for the families wrote in their complaint.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure follows executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to promote gender ideology and declares U.S. policy as recognizing two sexes, male and female.",
      "Half of the states have in recent years passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July. The Trump administration is likely to reverse the government's position in the case.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the seven transgender individuals argues that Mr. Trump's executive orders involving gender identity are unlawful and unconstitutional because he is usurping Congress' authority by unilaterally seeking to withhold funding from medical institutions, providers and researchers that have already received congressional approval.",
      "\"Under our Constitution, it is Congress, not the president, who is vested with the power of the purse,\" they argued in their filing. \"The president does not have unilateral power to withhold federal funds that have been previously authorized by Congress and signed into law, and the president does not have the power to impose his own conditions on the use of funds when Congress has not delegated to him the power to do so.\"",
      "The challengers warn that Mr. Trump's directive to cut off federal funding for medical providers that offer gender-affirming care has already had \"concrete and immediate effects.\" In one instance, Children's National based in Washington, D.C., announced last week \u2014 on the heels of the president's order \u2014 that it would be pausing its provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth.",
      "In another instance, one of the plaintiffs, a 17-year-old from Virginia identified in filings as W.G., was set to continue receiving hormone therapy from doctors at Virginia Commonwealth University Health and Children's Hospital, but had her appointment canceled. The hospital receives more than $100 million in federal grants, according to the complaint, and announced it would be suspending gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 19 in response to Mr. Trump's order.",
      "NYU Langone Health in New York City, which received more than $5.6 million in federal grants over the last 12 months, treats several of the transgender youth involved in the lawsuit but canceled planned procedures for two of them, according to the filing.",
      "\"By directing agencies to withhold all federal funding from entities that 'promote gender ideology' and provide gender affirming medical care to patients under nineteen, the Gender Identity and Denial of Care Orders threaten the ability of medical institutions and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to provide essential health care to their communities, train the next generation of physicians, and support research to address this country's greatest health challenges,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote.",
      "They are asking the court to declare Mr. Trump's orders are unlawful and block their enforcement.",
      "The president has issued a slew of executive orders in his first weeks back in the White House covering a wide range of issues, from immigration to energy to gender identity. Many have already been the subject of court challenges, and more are expected as federal agencies begin taking steps to implement Mr. Trump's directives.",

      "\"We demand that the mediators, especially the United States, oblige the occupation [Israel] to implement the ceasefire agreement in its three stages without procrastination or manipulation, as we are committed to implementing the agreement as long as the occupation commits to it, and any manipulation in implementing the agreement may cause it to collapse,\" senior Hamas political official Basem Naim said in a statement.",
      "America's partners in the Middle East reject Trump's Gaza plan",

      "\"France reiterates its opposition to any forced displacement of the Palestinian population of Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of international law, an attack on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians, but also a major obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilizing factor for our close partners Egypt and Jordan as well as for the entire region,\" French foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine said in a statement Wednesday.",

      "Dr. Sanam Vakil, Director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the British Chatham House think tank, said Mr. Trump's \"provocative\" comments \"could be trying to disrupt conventional thinking on a longstanding conflict that has yet to be resolved or produce viable solutions.\"",
      "\"He equally wants to show continued commitment to Israel to placate supporters and high-level donors in the United States and shore up Netanyahu's fragile political balance of power to help the prime minister engage in phase two ceasefire negotiations,\" Vakils said. \"More broadly, this is also part of his extreme deal-making strategy that will lay the ground for broader Israeli-Saudi normalization talks.

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Tourists continued to flee the Greek island of Santorini on Wednesday \u2014 a fourth consecutive day of exodus sparked by a series of earthquakes that have rattled the incredibly popular European vacation destination. Around 7,000 people have left the island, which sits southeast of Greece's mainland, since the\u00a0quakes began last week, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "Most of the visitors have left Santorini by ferry, but there have also been flights out.",
      "As of Tuesday, more than 1,000 earthquakes, with magnitudes up to 5.2 on the Richter scale, had been recorded near the island, most of them centered only about 15 miles from its shores in the Aegean Sea, according to the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre.",
      "Efthimios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization, told Greek national television that the earthquakes were moving north, away from the island, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"This may last several days or several weeks,\" he said. \"We are not able to predict the evolution of the sequence in time.\"",
      "It is that unpredictability of earthquakes that has driven people away from the island \u2014 nobody can say for sure whether the hundreds of small quakes mean a bigger temblor is on the way.",
      "\"I understand the fear of what it means at the moment to be on a Santorini that is constantly moving,\" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, urging residents to stay calm and follow any instructions provided by officials.",
      "Experts told the French news agency AFP the region had not experienced such intense seismic activity since records began in 1964.",
      "Santorini sits atop a volcano that has not erupted since 1950, but a committee of experts said Monday that the current rash of quakes was \"not linked to volcanic activity.\"",
      "\"It's different this time\"",
      "While the earthquakes have left cracks in some buildings, no substantial damage or injuries have been reported. The neighboring islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos have also reported no casualties.",
      "Schools on all four islands have also been closed for the week as a precaution, and Santorini has cancelled public events and restricted arrivals to the island.",
      "About 3.4 million people visited Santorini in 2023, according to the AFP.",
      "Panagiotis Hatzigeorgiou, a retired police officer and ship worker who has lived on the island for over 30 years, told the AP he wouldn't be leaving, despite invites to stay with relatives in the Greek capital, Athens.",
      "\"Older residents are used to the earthquakes,\" he said. \"But it's different this time. It's not the same to have earthquakes every two to three minutes.\"",
      "\"The main thing is not to worry,\" he said, adding with a laugh: \"Now we can listen to music alone and have coffee by ourselves.\"",

    "story": [
      "Orebro, Sweden \u2014 Sweden's worst-ever mass shooting left at least 11 people dead on Tuesday, including the gunman, and at least five seriously wounded at an adult education center west of Stockholm. The gunman's motive hadn't been determined by early Wednesday as the Scandinavian nation \u2014 where gun violence at schools is very rare \u2014 reeled from an attack with such bloodshed that police early on said it was difficult to count the number of dead among the carnage.",
      "Police chief Roberto Eid Forest, for the city of Orebro, about 100 miles west of Stockholm, where the tragedy played out, said Wednesday there was \"a lot to indicate that\" the gunman had shot himself, saying he was found already dead when police reached him.",
      "Officials said Wednesday that three women and two men, all with gunshot wounds, had undergone surgery at Orebro University Hospital. All were in serious but stable condition after being admitted to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Another woman was treated for minor injuries and was stable.",
      "Jonas Claesson, regional director of health and medical services, said that two of the gunshot victims were in intensive care Wednesday. All the victims are over the age of 18, officials said. No other patients related to the shooting were admitted to Orebro University Hospital overnight.",
      "The school, called Campus Risbergska, offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults age 20 and older, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. The school is on the outskirts of Orebro, which is about 125 miles west of Stockholm.",
      "Justice Minister Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer called the shooting \"an event that shakes our entire society to its core.\" King Carl XVI Gustaf and Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the Royal Palace and government buildings.",
      "The king and Queen Silvia were in Orebro and would visit the school district and attend a memorial service in the city, the palace said. Kristersson and Str\u00f6mmer would also be there. Soccer teams Degerfors IF and Orebro Syrianska will wear black armbands at a preseason match on Wednesday evening and hold a minute's silence before kickoff, Degerfors said.",
      "The shooting started Tuesday afternoon after many students had gone home following a national exam. Students sheltered in nearby buildings, and other parts of the school were evacuated following the shooting.",
      "Eid Forest, head of the local police, said the school's large premises meant it took a long time for officers to search the campus to ensure there were not any more victims. Police heard gunshots when they arrived and initially thought they were being fired upon, he said.",
      "Eid Forest said six officers were treated for smoke inhalation. There wasn't a fire, he said, and authorities didn't immediately know what caused the smoke.",
      "Investigators will spend Wednesday seeking information from witnesses and checking any video of the attack. Police wouldn't say whether the shooter had multiple guns.",
      "There were no warnings beforehand, and police believe the perpetrator acted alone. Police haven't said if the man was a student at the school. They haven't released a possible motive, but authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point.",
      "Police raided the suspect's home after Tuesday's shooting, but it wasn't immediately clear what they found. They cautioned the public against spreading incorrect narratives on social media.",
      "\"Today, we have witnessed brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people,\" the prime minister told reporters in Stockholm late Tuesday. \"This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. Many questions remain unanswered, and I cannot provide those answers either.",
      "\"But the time will come when we will know what happened, how it could occur, and what motives may have been behind it. Let us not speculate,\" he said.",
      "While gun violence at schools is very rare in Sweden, people were wounded or killed with other weapons such as knives or axes in several incidents in recent years.",
      "Gun ownership is legal in Sweden, but the country's\u00a0laws on firearms\u00a0are strict, with \"the right to possess weapons, even for protection purposes,\" requiring a license granted only with explicit permission from the police force, which must be applied for in advance of any intended purchase.",

      "A colossal explosion in the sky, unleashing energy hundreds of times greater than the Hiroshima bomb. A blinding flash nearly as bright as the sun. Shockwaves powerful enough to flatten everything for miles.",
      "It may sound apocalyptic, but a newly detected asteroid nearly the size of a football field now has a greater than one percent chance of colliding with Earth in about eight years.",
      "Such an impact has the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes.",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told AFP.",
      "What we know 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth -- its next close pass will not come until 2028.",
      "\"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero,\" said Betts.",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT -- more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft -- a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",

      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings \u2014\u00a0 level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\"",
      "\"Just can't go back,\" he continued. \"If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.\"",
      "Netanyahu, who is the first foreign leader to visit Mr. Trump during his second term, said of the president's idea, \"We're talking about it. He's exploring it with his people, with his staff. I think it's something that could change history, and it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\"",
      "On whether U.S. troops would be sent to Gaza, the president said, \"As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that.\"",

      "\"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president said his decision about taking over Gaza \"was not a decision made lightly,\" and he claimed he's received praise from other leaders in the Middle East, though he did not identify any by name. Two sources said later that top Trump aides knew in advance of Netanyahu's visit that the president planned to announce the proposal regarding U.S. ownership of Gaza.",
      "Leaders of several of the most powerful Arab nations previously said they strongly opposed any suggestion that residents of Gaza be resettled in other countries.",

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman affirmed the kingdom's position in \"a clear and explicit manner\" that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances, the statement said.",
      "Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri was also quick to dismiss the idea out of hand, telling Reuters the president's \"remarks about his desire to control Gaza are ridiculous and absurd, and any ideas of this kind are capable of igniting the region.\"",

The whole thing is a mess.\"",
      "The president said other \"rich\" nations should pay for a new home for Palestinians, although he did not expand on this suggestion.",

      "\"I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,\" Netanyahu replied.",
      "The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered in part by the U.S., continues to hold so far. Dual citizen Keith Siegel was the first American to be released since the implementation began last month, although other Americans have been released before.",

      "\"The belief is that when they entrust themselves to this Santa Muerte, they will not be caught or they will achieve their goal because Santa Muerte takes care of them,\" Duran police colonel Roberto Santamaria told AFP.",

      "Believed to date back to 18th century Mexico, the saint gained a following of drug lords there. Last November in Mexico, two women and a boy were shot dead at an altar to La Santa Muerte.",
      "The saint was more recently adopted by Ecuadoran traffickers and hitmen in Duran -- a city overrun by drug gangs that extort and terrorize locals.",
      "In addition to making offerings at altars, gang members tattoo the saint's likeness on their arms and wear amulets bearing her image around their necks.",
      "Santamaria said Santa Muerte came over from Mexico about six years ago when members of the Ecuadoran gang Los Choneros received training from the infamous Sinaloa cartel, which also transferred its otherworldly beliefs.",

      "Just last week, a leader of one of Ecuador's biggest crime syndicates, Los Lobos, was\u00a0arrested at his home\u00a0in the coastal city of Portoviejo. The\u00a0U.S. last year declared Los Lobos\u00a0to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "Noboa has declared a state of emergency and deployed troops in the streets and violence-riddled prisons, resulting in a slight dip in homicide rates in 2024 from the previous year. The president took action last year after gunmen stormed and opened fire\u00a0in a TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces. A prosecutor investigating the assault was later\u00a0shot dead.",
      "Officers scared to work around the altars",
      "Duran and the nearby city of Guayaquil are at the epicenter of Ecuador's violence, due in part to their proximity to the port increasingly used to send cocaine to Europe and the United States from neighbors Peru and Colombia -- the world's top producers of the drug.",
      "Like Mexico, Ecuador is a largely Catholic country, and the Church condemns the practice of portraying death as a personality like in the case of Santa Muerte.",

      "How is fentanyl entering the United States?",
      "Most fentanyl enters the United States through Mexico, CBS News has previously reported. The\u00a0U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0has said Mexican cartels are \"at the heart\" of the United States' fentanyl crisis.",
      "Caulkins' analysis found 21 large fentanyl seizures along the Mexican border for every such seizure along the Canadian border.",
      "Often, illicit drugs are transported over the southern border by U.S. citizens passing through CBP checkpoints, Caulkins said. The U.S. citizens are usually hired by smuggler groups, which have in turn been hired by cartels and drug manufacturers.",
      "\"In general, it's not like it's a Sinaloa cartel employee walking across the border,\" Caulkins said. U.S. citizens are less likely to be seen as suspicious, he said, and they face fewer obstacles during the actual border crossing.",
      "Precursor chemicals at the border",
      "Precursor chemicals, or the ingredients used to make illicit drugs, have been seized in both Canada and Mexico, as well as within the United States. Precursor chemicals are largely manufactured in China and shipped overseas, usually to Mexico. The fentanyl is then produced, again typically in Mexico, and brought into the United States for distribution.",
      "In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of chemical precursors and fentanyl.",
      "In November 2024, Canadian police said they had dismantled the most sophisticated drug \"super lab\"\u00a0that they had ever seen in the country. They said they seized a \"massive\" amount of precursor chemicals from the facility in British Columbia, as well as 54 kilograms, or about 110 pounds, of fentanyl, along with other drugs.",
      "Police said they believed the lab was a mass production site where fentanyl and methamphetamine were made so they could be distributed in Canada and internationally. Officials did not say what countries the drugs may have been exported to.",
      "In December 2024, Canada said its health agency would create a \"Chemical Precursor Risk Management Unit\" that could \"provide better insight into\" the chemicals and their distribution channels. The unit would also be able to \"enhance monitoring and surveillance\" and allow for \"timely law enforcement action\" in connection to these chemicals. The unit was just one of several ways Canada said it would be fighting the fentanyl crisis.",
      "Health Canada is also set to accelerate its regulatory process for banning precursors \"so that border and law enforcement can take swift action to prevent their illegal importation and use.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal authorities have released a pair of seeking information posters for two Iranian intelligence officers accused of authorizing the 2007 abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert Levinson. The posters come as part of a decades-long investigation into Levinson's disappearance, the FBI's Washington field office said Tuesday, noting their \"commitment to resolving the case for his long-suffering family.\"",
      "Since Levinson vanished, the United States has maintained the view that he was abducted during an unauthorized CIA mission in Iran and held wrongfully by the Iranian government. The former agent was thought to be alive until U.S. officials said in 2020 that intelligence suggested he may have been dead for \"some time.\"",
      "The posters include images of Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, the Iranian senior intelligence officers believed to be responsible for Levinson's abduction, subsequent detention and probable death. The men are described as high-ranking officers in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to the FBI.",
      "Levinson has not been seen or heard from since March 9, 2007, one day after the retired agent traveled to the Iranian island of Kish, according to the FBI. U.S. officials say Levinson's family received video and photographs of Levinson in anonymous emails several years later, in 2010 and 2011, which showed him in captivity. They ultimately released the footage and an image publicly but could not trace the emails back to their senders.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Baseri and Khazai under the Trump administration in 2020, the first time the country formally blamed Iran for Levinson's disappearance. At the time, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that Iranian officials \"authorized Levinson's abduction and detention and launched a disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the regime.\"",
      "His statement identified Baseri and Khazai by name.",
      "The U.S. has also accused Iran of sanctioning the scheme that resulted in Levinson's abduction and claimed its government knew the missing agent's location and lied about it for nearly 18 years.",
      "Federal officials claim Baseri has been involved in counterespionage activities within and outside of Iran, in addition to sensitive investigations related to Iranian national security, and \"has worked directly with intelligence officials from other countries to harm U.S. interests.\" Khazai has allegedly led Iranian intelligence and security delegations to other countries, the FBI said.",
      "The State Department is offering a reward of up to $20 million for information that leads to Levinson's recovery and return, while the FBI put forward a prize of up to $5 million for the same.",

    "story": [
      "Police in Sweden said Tuesday that \"about 10 people\" were killed in a shooting earlier in the day at a school for adults in the city of Orebro, west of Stockholm. The police offered\u00a0very little information on the incident throughout the most of the day, saying only that five people were wounded, including the suspected shooter, before suddenly confirming the initial death toll at about 6 p.m. local time (noon Eastern).",
      "The shooting occurred at the Campus Risbergska school, which, according to its website, is for students over the age of 20. The Reuters news agency said the adult education center is on campus that includes children's schools.",
      "Local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters that the suspected shooter was among those who had died, but he stressed that the ongoing investigation was complicated and they were still working to identify the victims and confirm the death toll. The national police force said in a separate message that the \"total number of injured\" remained uncertain.",
      "Officials said the motive remained unknown, but at present, there were not believed to be any additional perpetrators. However, in a news statement later in the evening, police said they \"cannot rule out more perpetrators connected to the incident.\"",
      "Before the fatalities were confirmed Forest said the \"the investigation is somewhat unclear,\" according to The Associated Press, including \"whether the shooting took place inside the school (building) or whether there may be more perpetrators.\"",
      "\"One of the injured persons is a person whom we suspect may be the assailant,\" Forest said at a news conference with medical officials, as the massive police operation continued more than three hours after the attack. \"We can't rule out other suspects, and that's something we are continuing to work on in this intensive phase now \u2014 why it happened and if there are other possible suspects.\"",
      "Medical officials said four of five wounded people had undergone surgery, including one whose injuries were serious. The AP cited a regional medical director as saying two others were in stable condition and a third was only slightly wounded. No police officers were shot, the force confirmed.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 09:52:32 -0500",
    "summary": "After meeting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, El Salvador's president has offered to house U.S. deportees and even American inmates in his country's \"mega-prison.\"",
    "story": [
      "San Salvador, El Salvador \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept and incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including criminals with American citizenship currently imprisoned in the U.S. President Nayib Bukele confirmed the offer in a social media post, saying El Salvador was willing to rehouse deportees and American prisoners in a two-year-old \"mega-prison\" he had built as potent symbol of his crackdown on criminal gangs.",
      "Bukele \"has agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\" Rubio said after meeting the Salvadoran leader at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said of migrants of all nationalities detained in the United States. \"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're U.S. citizens or legal residents.\"",
      "Bukele confirmed the offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.\"",
      "He said his country would accept only \"only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee\" that he said \"would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "Elon Musk, the billionaire working with Mr. Trump to remake the federal government, responded on his X platform, \"Great idea!!\"",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens, and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "CBS News reported\u00a0last month that El Salvador had agreed to accept U.S. deportations of \"criminal illegal migrants from any country,\" including members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet President Trump's demands for a major crackdown on\u00a0immigration.",
      "The State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as \"harsh and dangerous.\" On its current country information webpage it says, \"In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.\"",
      "Unlike many of the country's prisons, however, the massive facility known as CECOT that Bukele referred to after his talks with Rubio remains more than half-empty, according to the French news agency AFP, with capacity for 40,000 inmates but only about 15,000 currently estimated to be incarcerated there.",
      "Formally called the Terrorism Confinement Center, CECOT is surrounded by high concrete walls and it sits on the edge of a jungle about 45 miles southeast of San Salvador. According to AFP, inmates at the prison are only permitted to leave their cells for court hearings, which are conducted via video link, or for 30 minutes of daily exercise in an enclosed hall.",
      "Rubio arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador. His tour is taking place at a time of turmoil in Washington over the status of the government's main foreign development agency.",
      "The Trump administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \"safe third country\" agreement. Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \"safe third country\" plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington's \"backyard to dump the garbage.\"",
      "After meeting with Bukele, Rubio signed a memorandum of understanding with his Salvadoran counterpart to advance U.S.-El Salvador civil nuclear cooperation. The document could lead to a more formal deal on cooperation in nuclear power and medicine that the U.S. has with numerous countries.",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\"Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \"It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it's not good for anyone.\"",
      "Monday's deportation flight came as Mr. Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters after Musk announced Mr. Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades - although its new status will likely be challenged in court - and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Mr. Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Mr. Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\"I understand that it's a delicate issue in Panama,\" Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \"We don't want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\" he said. \"I don't believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it'll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\"",
      "But back in Washington, Mr. Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China's involved with the Panama Canal. They won't be for long and that's the way it has to be.\"",
      "\"We either want it back, or we're going to get something very strong, or we're going to take it back,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"And China will be dealt with.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 A panel of experts has disputed the medical evidence used to convict British nurse Lucy Letby of murdering seven newborns and trying to kill seven others, a doctor who led the examination said Tuesday. Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said the group of 14 doctors concluded the newborns either died of natural causes or from bad medical care.",
      "\"In summary then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find murders,\" Lee said at a London news conference.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murder and attempted murder while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "Defense lawyer Mark McDonald said there was now \"overwhelming evidence\" that Letby was wrongly convicted.",
      "It was the second news conference held in part by McDonald to challenge the conclusions of Dr. Dewi Evans, who was the prosecution's key expert witness.",
      "Prosecutors said Letby left little trace when she killed babies and in some cases had injected air into their bloodstreams or stomach, causing an embolism. But Lee said Evans had misinterpreted his 1989 academic paper on embolism.",
      "Lee said he assembled a prestigious group of international medical experts who volunteered to review the records of 17 babies Letby was accused of injuring or killing.",
      "Evans diagnosed the babies with air embolism in the absence of finding another cause of death, Lee said. But Lee said embolism is very rare and the skin discoloration described at trial was not consistent with what is seen when there is an embolism.",
      "\"The notion that these babies can be diagnosed with air embolism because they collapsed and had these skin discolorations has no evidence in fact,\" Lee said.",
      "Letby has already lost two bids for an appeal. Her lawyer submitted an application on Monday to get the Criminal Case Review Commission to examine her conviction, which could lead to another shot at an appeal.",
      "A separate public inquiry into failures at the hospital that led babies to repeatedly be harmed is due to conclude next month. That probe is not examining evidence used to convict Letby but is aimed at accountability of hospital staff and management and looking at how parents were treated.",
      "During her trial, Senior Prosecutor Nicola Wyn Williams alleged that Letby had removed one baby's breathing support and that a doctor found her standing by doing nothing as the child struggled,",
      "Williams alleged that Letby then removed the breathing tube two more times over the next few hours, \"in an attempt to cover her tracks and suggest that the first dislodgment was accidental.\"",
      "Dr. Ravi Jayaram, a pediatrician at the hospital, told jurors he saw \"no evidence\" that Letby had done anything to help the baby when he walked in and saw her standing next to the newborn's incubator.",
      "Letby told the jury in that case that she had no recollection of any such event, and she has always denied committing any of the offenses she had been convicted of.",

    "story": [
      "More than 80 years after a Brazilian warship was sunk by a German submarine during World War II, the vessel's location has finally been confirmed, Brazil's navy has revealed. The historic vessel was positively identified over a decade after a fisherman's net became ensnared on the shipwreck, without him realizing what the obstacle was.",
      "On the night of July 19, 1944, the \"Vital de Oliveira\" was torpedoed by a Nazi German sub. It was the only Brazilian military ship to be sunk by enemy forces during World War II, the navy said in a news release. About 100 of the ship's crew of approximately 270 were killed.",
      "The ship had mainly been used to transport soldiers and supplies along the coast, and according to Brazil's O Globo newspaper, the crew included teenagers who worked as cabin boys.",
      "The site of the wreck was initially found in 2011 by a pair of brothers after a fisherman's net got stuck at the bottom of the sea, the navy said. Ultimately, a deep-sea diver named Domingos Afonso J\u00f3rio discovered that the net was stuck on a cannon, and he reported the wreck site to the navy. But officials could not confirm any shipwreck at the time.",
      "The navy said Friday that the location of the hull of the sunken ship was finally confirmed last month, about 40 miles off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.\u00a0 The discovery was confirmed during a survey by an oceanographic research vessel, also called \"Vital de Oliveira.\"",
      "Archaeologists used sophisticated equipment to gather data about the position and condition of the vessel, the navy said. A multibeam echo sounder was used to create 3-D models of the ocean floor, and a side scan sonar generated high-resolution acoustic images of the wreck.",
      "\"The equipment used allowed us to obtain unprecedented images of the hull,\" the navy said in a statement.",
      "The images obtained during the survey will be used to create three-dimensional models of the shipwreck, the navy said.",
      "Technical dives and remotely operated underwater vehicles may also be used to capture photographs and videos, as well as to collect additional data on the vessel and any artifacts associated with the shipwreck.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Dr. Atul Gawande said denigrating USAID is \"dangerous for the country\" and shuttering its programs could make Americans less safe.",
    "story": [
      "Former USAID Global Health director  Dr. Atul Gawande criticized the Trump administration's plan to merge the United States Agency for International Development into the State Department and the funding freezes that are putting key aid programs in jeopardy. Asked about the changes, he said, \"It's not an overhaul. It's a destruction.\"",
      "Gawande, a surgeon, medical professor and best-selling author, told CBS News on Monday that the \"destruction\" began a week ago after the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance. The memo was walked back days later and the ordered freeze has been halted by a federal court, but programs appear to still be halted or in limbo.",
      "\"You're talking about 20 million people in the global HIV program\u00a0that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive,\" Gawande said. \"You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 49 countries.\"",
      "\"There is a great deal of harm being done, and this change to take away the independent status [of USAID] is just a nail in the coffin after a purge of personnel that has decimated the agency,\" Gawande said.",
      "Other former USAID workers expressed similar concerns.",
      "Maura Reap, who was a USAID contractor with the Bureau for Global Health until last week, had just arrived on a two-week assignment in Ethiopia when Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0ordered a pause\u00a0on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. During the first week of the assignment, Reap was supposed to be focused on designing a project supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Reap, whose expertise is in mental health, said the program had been planned for months.",
      "\"We had some meetings over the weekend, and there was just a lot of uncertainty,\" Reap said in an interview with CBS News. \"It was like a slow train wreck.\"",
      "Eventually, she got an email saying she had to return to Washington, D.C. While she was in the air, she and her two colleagues had received termination notices.",
      "\"This terrible waste of a [temporary duty travel] with all the planning and investment that had gone into it, and it was for nothing,\" she said.",
      "Gawande also hit back at Mr. Trump and\u00a0billionaire Elon Musk's comments, who have both slammed the agency, with Mr. Trump recently saying the USAID is \"run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\" Musk said the agency \"is not an apple with a worm in it, what we have actually, just a ball of worms.\"",
      "Gawande countered, \"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration is expected to announce details in the coming days about the disruption to the USAID, a 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries. The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Mr. Trump has vowed to cut the size of the federal government, and USAID has been a recent target of his and Musk's, who is tasked with leading the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Earlier Monday, the White House released a list of examples of what it deemed wasteful spending by USAID in recent years. Democratic lawmakers, however, have warned that any attempt to change USAID's structure and funding would require an act of Congress.",
      "Reap expressed dismay that \"somebody who's not even elected can come in and just take this 60-year-old institution that has accomplished so much ... and to have so much disregard and to take it and to turn it and to throw it on his back and to say, this is not \u2014 this is, we're throwing it out.\"",
      "Gawande said it's \"dangerous for the country to denigrate\" the agency, saying it's the country's \"largest civilian operational capacity for advancing\" the work of the U.S. abroad.",
      "\"We're talking about world-class expertise. For example, the malaria program. Two-thirds have been fired, and the activity shutdown includes one of the global experts in malaria for us. How does that make us safer? How does that make us stronger?\" Gawande said.",
      "Reap also argued that the work USAID does saves lives and supports policies that benefit the United States.",
      "\"Because, I mean, there's so many things related to the work we do,\" Reap said. \"Stopping outbreaks, reducing the push and pull factors for migration at our southern \u2014 at our borders. The work we do counters extremism, and it leads \u2014 it contributes to stable communities by the work we're doing by keeping people healthy so they can contribute to their communities.\"",
      "Gawande noted, \"Every administration goes through an overhaul that says they want to change policy, they want to change some direction, but you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process. There was no need to close down all of its functions, which is harming people.\"",

      "Ryan Reynolds' Hollywood reputation is likely taking \"a little bruising\" nearly one month after Justin Baldoni filed a $400 million defamation lawsuit against the \"Deadpool\" star and his wife, Blake Lively.",
      "Reynolds and Lively were accused of attempting to hijack \"It Ends With Us\" and create their own narrative in the federal suit Baldoni filed just weeks after Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment on set of the film.",
      "As the legal battle heats up with a recent court hearing and trial date set for March 2026, each of the actors has remained relatively low-profile in public. However, Reynolds' social media presence of late and a surprising show of support at an A-list pal's performance has experts questioning if the Canadian actor is picking up the pieces of the squeaky-clean image he once held in both hands.",

And with the trial more than a year away, the longer they stay tangled in this PR fight, the worse it gets. What started as a legal dispute is turning into a messy spectacle. Neither side is winning the he-said-she-said, and the more they engage, the more exhausting they\u00a0become.

      "\"Ryan Reynolds is probably the only celebrity in this case who stands to have his image burnished,\" Mercuri told Fox News Digital. \"His sole task will be to stand as a supportive husband. As a couple, Ryan and Blake seem to be pretty solid, making them stand out among the usual Hollywood couples who seem prone to breakups and divorce. They\u2019ve been married since 2012 and chose to raise a family away from the usual entertainment meccas of Los Angeles and New York City. Doing so has made them more relatable to their fan base.\"",
      "He added, \"In terms of potential impact, it\u2019s hard to estimate. Justin Baldoni\u2019s legal team has already come out swinging in an apparent attempt to intimidate Blake. Still, she has the support of a vast fan base who will require a boatload of evidence in order to believe that she is lying.\"",

Three months ahead of the disaster, Lake and her husband, Ross Burningham, appeared on an October 2024 episode of Henry's Netflix show \"Live from the Other Side,\" in which the 29-year-old celebrity psychic warned the couple that they would suffer a loss of material possessions due to fire and water.",

We had like a really bad storm and our basement flooded, and it got a bunch of pictures ruined, and we couldn't ever bring them back. There's just something about watching water seepage into a place it shouldn't and damaging things. So keeping both of those things in mind.\"",

And she had already previously dealt with a fire. And so we were kind of looking forward to the water, and it ended up happening again.\"",
      "\"And I actually followed up with her, and she'd acknowledged that before this fire occurred, a pipe had burst and water had flooded down over her bed shortly after she met with me,\" Henry continued. \"So I was like, \u2018The prophecy is fulfilled, right?\u2019 She's had a fire in the past. She's got the water. Well, then this happened, and it was very much attributed as a prediction, even if it wasn't exactly that. But it definitely was tuning into events that occurred.\"",

She vowed that she and Burningham, who are currently staying at a friend's guest house, will not sell their land in Malibu and plan to create \"something else just as magical\" in the future.",
      "\"She has such a humble and resilient, altruistic approach,\" Henry said of Lake. \"And I was just so taken aback. I mean, this is something that she put her blood, sweat and tears in \u2014 her home. She went to so much effort to make hers and then to see that gone in an instant. I would not have been as strong as she was.\"",
      "\"She truly is so inspiring,\" he continued. \"And, you know, she is focused on the future, which I think is really, at this point, all we can do. This experience widely has spoken to what we can control and what we can't. And these readings demonstrate, you know, we can only really focus on what we can control and have to pray for the ability to discern the difference.\"",

      "JENNIFER LOPEZ MAY HAVE TO TAKE PAGE OUT OF ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S PLAYBOOK FOR UPCOMING MOVIE WITH BEN AFFLECK",
      "Doug Eldridge of Achilles PR agreed that both stars, and Affleck in particular, don\u2019t want to distract from their work.",
      "\"He wants his films\u2014regardless of whether he's acted, directed, or produced them\u2014to stand and speak for themselves,\" Eldridge said. \"When you couple that with his dislike for the bright lights and predictably bawdy questions surrounding another break-up, it makes sense why he would take a pass on the promenade.\"",
      "He added, \"That said, Affleck is deliberate in his public appearances\u2014in some cases to support his friends and long-time collaborators, like Matt Damon, but in other cases to avoid controversy and conjecture, due to an unintended red carpet cross-over with his ex, Jennifer Lopez. (A good publicist would've choreographed that so there was no stepping on toes\u2014literally or figuratively.) The former drew positive headlines and coverage from the likes of People Magazine; the latter would've drawn tabloid scrutiny and rumination, all of which would have distracted from the integrity of the film he produced.\"",
      "Schmiemann said, \"The decision for Ben to be less of the front-man promoter is likely two-fold \u2014 when you're a producer and not the headliner, and also feel most comfortable in a behind-the-scenes capacity \u2014 there's likely not too much to infer from these decisions, as it makes strategic sense.\"",
      "Eldridge also noted that as a woman, Lopez may be under more pressure to appear in public than her ex. \"Additionally, in a very archaic way, an actress must remain visible, in order to remain viable, in Hollywood,\" he explained. \"When was the last time you saw [Chris] Hemsworth, [Tom] Hardy or Harrison Ford, walking a red carpet for a project they weren't tied to? By contrast, starlets are somewhat tethered to the red carpet to remind both fans and film studios that they are red-hot and ready for that next role. Hollywood has undergone a radical transformation in the wake of the #MeToo movement, but some elements still remain\u2014good, bad or otherwise.\"",
      "Lopez may be under more pressure to appear publicly as a woman in Hollywood, according to expert Doug Eldridge. (Hector Vivas)",
      "JENNIFER LOPEZ STUNS AT PREMIERE OF BEN AFFLECK-PRODUCED FILM 'UNSTOPPABLE'; ACTOR IS A NO-SHOW",
      "Schmiemann explained that it is ultimately a balance of personal and professional.",
      "\"No one enjoys running into an ex when you're fresh off of a breakup or divorce, regardless of celebrity status. Most of us try to avoid these situations at all costs because the anguish, drama and anxiety is just not worth it. But for those who work with their exes, sometimes it must be done, and I'd have expected them both to be professional if ever they need to share a stage or red carpet together again. However, would the conversation immediately shift to analysis about who said, did, snubbed the other, as opposed to said film \u2014 absolutely.",
      "\"The buzz will certainly generate widespread attention the first time they occupy the same space publicly \u2014 but it's not necessarily a bad thing for any movie they'd be promoting. In fact, it could very well be strategic to up the ante and draw more attention and views.\"",
      "Lopez and Affleck previously collaborated on projects during both rounds of their relationship, first in 2002 with the films \"Gigli\" and \"Jersey Girl,\" and last year with the high-concept music film \"This is Me . . . Now: A Love Story\" and the accompanying documentary, \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told.\"",
      "In \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told,\" the distance between their respective relationships with the spotlight became apparent.",
      "\"The Greatest Love Story Never Told\" highlighted the former couple's difference of opinion about public attention. (Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images)",
      "In the early minutes of the documentary, Lopez shared that her new music was inspired by a collection of handwritten love letters from Affleck, which she showed to songwriters and musicians working with her.",
      "Affleck admitted there was an irony in making a record about \"the greatest love story never told\" by telling it so publicly.",
      "\"Jen was really inspired by this experience, which is how artists do their work,\" he said in the film. \"They get inspired by their personal life, it moves you. I know as a writer and director I certainly do the same things. But things that are private I had always felt are sacred and special, in part because they\u2019re private. So, this was something of an adjustment for me.\"",
      "According to People, she told the audience during a Q&A screening that her then husband was a \"reluctant participant.\"",

      "\"In one sense, this is arguably an extension of their base behavior\u2014through every relationship and various stages of her career reinvention(s), Lopez always sought the spotlight, while Affleck held a marked disdain for the red carpets, galas, press junkets, pomp and circumstance of Hollywood. Seeing her attend and him remain absent, is not surprising,\" Eldridge said.",
      "\"Affleck is both a farmer and a hunter\u2014he is active on both sides of the camera, with numerous projects in the works at all times. By contrast, Lopez is a pure hunter; she leaves the cave every morning with a spear and an empty stomach; if she doesn't make a kill, she doesn't eat.\"",
      "He continued, \"Affleck is both a farmer and a hunter\u2014he is active on both sides of the camera, with numerous projects in the works at all times. By contrast, Lopez is a pure hunter; she leaves the cave every morning with a spear and an empty stomach; if she doesn't make a kill, she doesn't eat. Affleck can choose to hunt while his crops mature to harvest; Lopez must remain visible and, on the move, in order for her career to survive and thrive. Neither of these are indictments on their personality, or professionalism; merely a delineation of their respective approaches to the industry.\"",

      "She continued, \"With those types of people, there's a part of them that fools you into thinking that they care about you and that they truly love you\u2014and it's really about their damage that they're putting onto you.\"",
      "Ultimately, Affleck and Lopez have been consistent with their respective brands in the wake of their divorce, a strategy that has been working, according to Schmiemann.",
      "\"The best plan is always the one that you can execute comfortably. They would not be doing themselves, their movies, reputations or individual teams any favors to force attendance at certain events or be together, front-and-center, for any promotional gigs if tensions are too high, and their visual\u00a0presence is less than ideal. Ben and JLo have both spent years cultivating their public personas and want to showcase themselves and their work with professionalism and positivity\u2014and keeping their heads low and doing their own things right now is working.\""

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 07:03:36 -0500",
    "summary": "The co-founder of Moms for Liberty and another parental rights advocate say the Kids Off Social Media Act has loopholes that could signal government overreach.",
    "story": [
      "Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice explained her concerns over the Kids Off Social Media Act, namely that it does not apply to YouTube Kids.",
      "A new bipartisan bill intended to shield children under 13 from harmful content on social media does not apply to YouTube Kids, which parental rights advocates warn still feeds transgender ideology and DEI videos to minors.",
      "Parental rights advocates who spoke to Fox News Digital also took issue with the bill, deemed the Kids Off Social Media Act, over its restrictions on the algorithm, suggesting the measure constitutes \"government overreach.\"",
      "The bill was introduced by Sens. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Katie Britt, R-Ala., and is expected to go to mark-up on Wednesday.\u00a0In an online question-and-answer fact sheet, Schatz's office said YouTube Kids does not fit the definition of social media under the bill, nor do video games and other platforms like wireless messaging, educational platforms and teleconferencing.",
      "Upon visiting the YouTube Kids site, users are prompted to determine whether they are a parent or a child. It tells parents they must set up an account for their children and can block videos or channels they do not like. Among the content available to children on the site are videos made by \"queer\" creators, including from the accounts Queer Kid Stuff, Nickelodeon and CBC Kids News, advocates note. Other popular videos center on DEI, such as explaining \"systemic racism\" to children.",

      "\"I don't think that we should just exclude apps from scrutiny because they say kids in them. You know, we're all familiar with the so-called gender-affirming care, which isn't really helpful or caring in any way. We've learned that, right? So the title of something shouldn't just allay our fears. I don't know why YouTube Kids has been excluded,\" Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"What we have seen on YouTube Kids, I've seen personally myself, is evidence of transgender ideology being fed to kids,\" she explained. \"We know that trans activists have been targeting children. We know that there are vulnerable children who see this content. They often will click on it. Sometimes the algorithm will feed them more of that content. And so I think it's very concerning. I don't want parents to just say, this is meant for children and everything's okay.\"",
      "\"We have always said it, Moms for Liberty, we do not co-parent with the government.,\" Justice said. \"So I really would like to continue to tell parents they need to be involved. They need to be the ones that are making those choices.\"",
      "\"There's a tidal wave of evidence barreling down on the United States showing that so-called gender-affirming care is bad for children,\" she said, championing President Donald Trump's executive action to remove DEI and gender ideology from classrooms. \"We do not want our children indoctrinated, indoctrinated to think that they were born in the wrong body. This is a horrible message. Stopping the natural, healthy development of children is criminal. And so the idea that you have a website that is feeding kids content around gender, ideology or DEI is extremely concerning. And it is worrisome that perhaps parents think, well, it's YouTube Kids, so it's safe.\"",
      "Reached by Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for YouTube defended the YouTube Kids app but did not address the legislative proposal directly.",
      "\"The YouTube Kids app puts parents in the driver\u2019s seat,\" the spokesperson said. \"Parents can choose what their kids see and what they don\u2019t see. They have control over the content their kids watch and can easily go into the app to curate a list of allowed channels or block content from their child\u2019s profile through the \u2018approved content only\u2019 setting.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Justice highlighted separate legislative measures introduced by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to protect children online, including one bill introduced last session that would require age verification in the app store.",
      "Lee is not listed as a co-sponsor of the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would prohibit social media platforms from allowing children under the age of 13 to create or maintain social media accounts, but does not include a parental consent provision. That bill would not require users to present a government ID to gain access to social media and instead requires social media companies to use data about their users, including pictures they post, channels they follow or the date of birth they require upon sign-up to determine if a child is on their platform.",
      "The YouTube Kids logo is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen. (Faisal Bashir/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "As for another aspect of the Kids Off Social Media Act, Justice said she was concerned that the bill bans \"algorithmic boosting\" for children under 17. Under the bill, social media platforms would not be able to use machine learning to follow exactly how long children watch posts and what they click on to learn what makes each individual child stay on the platform the longest.",
      "Schatz's office argued that social media companies exploit kids for profit in this way, but Justice said her main concern is the government controlling the algorithm.",
      "THERAPISTS SOUND ALARM AFTER STUDY SHOWS DRAMATIC RISE IN GENDER DYSPHORIA AMONG CHILDREN\"If your son likes hockey, and it gives you more hockey information, well, I don't know that that would bother me,\" Justice said, explaining that she met a fellow mom who told her she goes on her children's social media accounts and \"trains\" the algorithm to pull up more conservative political content so that her teenagers are exposed to another perspective outside mainstream media.",
      "\"So I just think there are a lot of questions about who's controlling the algorithm,\" Justice said. \"We know that there are oftentimes really dangerous content that can affect children's mental health. We have evidence of that. And so we want to be really careful about how that algorithm is being used. And again, I just don't know that I want the government making those decisions for my family.\"",
      "Another parental rights advocate, Cat Parks, the former vice chair of the Texas GOP, told Fox News Digital that her primary concern with the Kids Off Social Media Act is that it \"represents unnecessary government overreach in an area where parents need to have ultimate authority.\" Parks said the \"real issue here is that it's parents who need to be informed to be able to make the correct decisions for their children, not something that's mandated by the government.\"",
      "\"As a parent, I'm very involved in my son's online presence and approve what platforms that he's allowed to interact with. So what I don't want, I don't want government to be able to strip my ability for my child's feed to be personalized or for me as a parent to choose and make the decisions about what he has access to,\" Parks said.",
      "A YouTube app logo is displayed on an iPhone in the Apple Store. (Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "Justice argued that the onus is on parents to shield their children from harmful content, and while there may be a role for government to play, \"it's really kind of murky as to what that role is going to be.\"",
      "\"We know that the algorithm is addicting,\" she said. \"I know that it wants you to keep scrolling and feeds you more information that it thinks that you'd be interested in. It's just a question of what is that information now \u2013 transgender ideology, gender ideology. We're working to wipe it off the face of the map. So, hopefully, that type of content won't be as prevalent. But again, the bottom line is parents need to be active, engaged and involved in what their children are accessing online.\"",
      "\"I don't want the government to be my kid's daddy,\" she added. \"They have a father, and he's a great one, and we'll make good decisions for our kids together.\"",
      "Most apps have age restrictions, but Schatz's office cited a 2023 United Kingdom regulatory study that found nearly\u00a040% of children\u00a0ages 8\u201312 still use social media platforms.",
      "In the question-and-answer document, Schatz's office also said the bill \"does not prevent LGBTQ+ youth from accessing relevant resources online.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"We have worked closely with LGBTQ+ groups while crafting this legislation to ensure that this bill will not negatively impact this community,\" the fact sheet said. \"Under this bill, kids would still be able to affirmatively seek out content and have that information displayed in a chronological feed.

While it may look similar at first glance, this clever Kiwi invention offers a unique blend of on-demand service, direct routing and privacy that sets it apart from traditional public transportation. Unlike fixed-route gondolas, Whoosh pods are equipped with their own motors and autonomous navigation systems.

The pod will be waiting at a nearby station, ready to whisk you away to your destination. These stations are designed with minimal footprint, fitting into a standard car park space and featuring a spiral ramp up to the network height of about 40 feet above the ground. Larger stations can be built at ground level, offering easy access for passengers.",
      "The network itself consists of tensioned cables spanning 500-985 feet, interspersed with shorter sections of steel rail for smooth turns and junctions. This design allows Whoosh to overcome geographical obstacles with ease, crossing rivers, highways or even connecting rooftops.",

While this may not sound impressive at first, the non-stop nature of the journey means it could be significantly faster than driving through congested urban areas. The system features remarkable efficiency, using less energy for a standard ride than a 10-minute shower. This is achieved through constant motion and low rolling resistance, making Whoosh about twice as efficient as a small electric car. Comfort hasn't been overlooked either. The pods can lean into corners, much like a motorcycle, providing a smooth ride even at higher speeds. The cable sections of the journey offer an especially pleasant \"floating\" sensation.",

Sketchy ticket resellers flood search results and social media with deals that seem too good to be true. Online ticket fraud is becoming increasingly common. While some tickets may be legitimate, many are not, with fans spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for nothing.",

For instance, scammers search for popular buzzwords and hashtags that people use when looking to buy tickets, such as #SuperBowl, #SuperBowlTickets or #LookingForTickets.

Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at\u00a01Password, shared some tips on staying safe leading up to the games. These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are always looking for new ways to take advantage of football fans, especially during major events like the Super Bowl. Whether it is fake ticket sales, phishing scams or bogus giveaways, the risks are real. You can easily avoid becoming a victim of these types of attacks by staying vigilant and being cautious of emails and links that ask for personal information.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:00:55 -0500",
    "summary": "A new scam using Elon Musk&apos;s name is making the rounds, promoting &quot;energy-saving&quot; devices and falsely linking the Tesla and SpaceX leader to the products.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",
      "Elon Musk scam email ads (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Red flags to watch out for",
      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022.

      "While Apple has patched this issue, it\u2019s a reminder that staying on top of updates is key. Hackers are always looking for security gaps, so keeping your software up to date is one of the best ways to stay safe.",
      "SCAMMERS FOUND A SNEAKY WAY TO BYPASS YOUR IPHONE'S SAFETY FEATURES",
      "7 ways to keep your iPhone safe",
      "Protecting your iPhone requires proactive security measures. By following these seven essential steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats and keep your personal information secure.",
      "1. Keep your iPhone updated:\u00a0I can\u2019t say this enough.\u00a0Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.",
      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",
      "Open\u00a0Settings.Scroll down and click\u00a0Apps.\u00a0Tap\u00a0Messages.Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",
      "Open\u00a0Settings.",
      "Scroll down and click\u00a0Apps.",
      "Tap\u00a0Messages.",
      "Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "This iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 04:00:53 -0500",
    "summary": "A law enforcement veteran describes how people can defend themselves after Chilean migrant burglary rings continue to target American homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Michael Barbieri, a law enforcement veteran, says Americans need to stay alert and be prepared as the people breaking into wealthy homes are not 'normal criminals.'",
      "A rise in high-profile home invasions, allegedly carried out by Chilean migrants, has security experts warning Americans about South American burglary rings targeting U.S. homeowners.",
      "Prominent targets in the last few months have included NFL stars Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Joe Burrow. Four Chilean nationals have been charged in the December burglary of Burrow's Ohio home, an investigation that led to two more arrests Tuesday as authorities searched a pawn shop in New York City's Diamond District.",
      "\"This is one of the first times we actually heard about an athlete's home being hit while they were playing football. So this just kind of started, but it's now kind of escalating to not only just athletes, but it's escalating to wealthy people,\" Michael Barbieri, a law enforcement veteran who works as an investigator with Global Intelligence Consultants, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Targets have also included affluent enclaves like Newport Beach, California, where a Chilean national was accused of a home invasion on Tuesday.",

      "Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes were both targeted by burglars in 2024. (Reuters/Getty Images)",
      "\"Nowadays, you can find out anything on Google. You could Google somebody's name and find out that he's the CEO of a big company in California or in Minnesota or somewhere like that. So that's what they're looking for,\" Barbieri said after hearing about the Newport Beach home theft.",
      "\"They gather intelligence information that's going to help them commit the crime. And that's exactly what's going on. And they're very good at it. And they take their time. They just don't go breaking into anyone's home. They take their time, and they find the people where they believe have the most that they can steal from.\"",
      "Barbieri explained that homeowners need to be more vigilant as a growing trend in migrant burglary rings is on the rise.",
      "\"Most of the time we think of cartels as smuggling drugs and people and everything else into our country. But what we're looking at is a cartel, that is zeroing in on very, very wealthy people. They use surveillance, they use trackers. They use everything you could possibly imagine,\" Barbieri explained.",
      "\"They wait until that person either leaves town or is at work or, in the case of professional football players and any other professional athlete, is on TV. So they know exactly where he's at before they break into his home,\" Barbieri said in reference to Burrow's case.",

      "Members of a Chilean crime gang are pictured breaking into an upscale Oakland County home in Michigan. (WJBK)",

      "\"They look for high-end cars. Somebody driving around in a Rolls-Royce, or driving around a Bentley, or driving around in a Mercedes-Benz and they have the ability to gather the license information, and they pay someone probably to run those plates to determine where that person lives,\" Barbieri explained on how these criminals are finding their targets.",
      "\"They either put a tracker on the vehicle to make sure that that's where he lives, and then they do counter-surveillance on these people so they know exactly what's going on in their lives. They know when they go to work, they know when and where they go to lunch, they know how long they're out for lunch. These are things that are part of a surveillance team that they have.\"",
      "4 CHILEAN NATIONALS ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH BENGALS' JOE BURROW HOME BURGLARY",
      "\"It's a sophisticated system that we're really looking at. We're not looking at a bunch of guys who just strolled across the border, and they don't know what they're doing. They know exactly what they're doing,\" Barbieri said.",
      "In Burrow's case, the investigation led authorities to search a pawn shop in Manhattan on Tuesday, where they \"seized large quantities of suspected stolen property, including dozens of high-end watches and jewelry. Law enforcement also recovered large quantities of cash and marijuana,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York said.",
      "Officials said they also found \"large quantities of luxury goods and clothing, including high-end handbags, wine, sports memorabilia, jewelry, artwork and power tools consistent with those commonly used in burglaries and opening safes\" in a New Jersey storage facility.",
      "Two men, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar. were arrested in Tuesday's operations, accused of acting as \"fences\" for South American-based crime groups targeting luxury heists across the United States.",
      "They are accused of buying stolen luxury goods from burglary crews and then reselling them for almost five years.",
      "\"The defendants\u2019 alleged actions incentivized highly organized South American Theft Groups to continue their meticulous looting scheme against a myriad of affluent residences and businesses across the country,\" James E. Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, said in a statement.",
      "Pictured is surveillance footage from a recent looting carried out by the Chilean crime ring at a Michigan home, shared with Fox 2 Detroit by a homeowner.\u00a0 (WJBK)",
      "After Mahomes' and Kelce's homes were burgalized in October, the NFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero\u00a0reported at the time that the FBI was investigating the crime spree, \"which is believed to be tied to a South American crime syndicate.\"",
      "Barbieri said he is hopeful that President Donald Trump's border security plan will help decrease these crimes, but said we are still dealing with the large amounts of cartels who have already crossed into our country and are wreaking havoc.",
      "\"We're now trying to round them up, but we're not going to get to all of them that fast. A lot of them are sending these things back to their countries of origin. So if they're from Venezuela or if they're from Caracas or if they're from some other place, Mexico City, then a lot of these guys are cashing these things in that they are stealing and sending the money back to their country or to their families,\" Barbieri explained.",
      "FBI WARNS SOUTH AMERICAN CRIME GROUPS TARGETING STAR ATHLETES IN BURGLARIES: REPORT",
      "\"They have some sophisticated ways to get rid of the merchandise that they have stolen. You just can't go down the street and turn it in because somebody will immediately turn you in. So they have a network of places that they are dropping these items off at, and they're gathering the cash for them.\"",
      "Barbieri shared that these cartels are sending the stolen merchandise by plane and to other countries, which is making it nearly untraceable.",
      "\"In the end, it's difficult to run that down. It's almost impossible to run down,\" Barbieri said about locating the stolen merchandise.",
      "Barbieri said Americans can better protect themselves by being aware of their surroundings and making sure they have cameras inside and outside their homes.",

      "He also recommended investing in a gun or weapon of some sort to better protect yourself from harm.",
      "\"Make sure you have some sort of weapon that you can protect yourself in your home against these people because these are violent criminals. These are not your normal guys that are just hanging around a school lot. These guys are violent criminals. They come from a violent country where there is no law and order. So that's what you need to be prepared for,\" Barbieri warned.",
      "Barbieri added another way Americans can protect themselves from becoming a victim of these home invasions is to fully vet anyone they hire and do a background check, which he acknowledged could be difficult, because some of these criminals have an inside connection to the homes they are stealing from.",
      "\"They're gathering intelligence from inside your own home from somebody who has already been there. I mean, you don't break into somebody's house and go through two sets of gates if you don't know the combinations. And that's exactly what happened to Patrick Mahomes,\" Barbieri said.",

It was one of the five key cities of the Philistines, who arrived from the Aegean, known for their clashes with the Israelites. The story of Samson, who tore down a Philistine temple, is one of the earliest recorded tales of destruction and rebuilding in Gaza. Over centuries, it was conquered by the Egyptians, Babylonians and Persians, each bringing new rulers and forcing population shifts. Even then, Gaza was a land where people came and went, often not by choice.",

While today\u2019s political realities make mass relocation unlikely, history shows that radical shifts in Gaza\u2019s demography are not unprecedented.",

      "\"Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s historic visit to Washington will mark a significant moment in Israel-U.S. relations, setting a tone of close cooperation and friendship between the Israeli government and the Trump administration,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter told Fox News Digital.",

      "Leiter, appearing on \"America's Newsroom\" last week, told Dana Perino that Iran would be front and center during the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. \"We will make the point that to allow Tehran to maintain its nuclear capabilities, which they can raise very quickly toward nuclear weapons, is simply unacceptable,\" he stated.",
      "Netanyahu was last at the White House on July 25, 2024, with then-President Biden having only invited the Israeli leader some 20 months after his re-election. This was widely viewed as a snub by Biden, whose party has increasingly distanced itself from traditional bipartisan support for the Jewish state.",
      "Netanyahu told reporters ahead of his departure that it was \"telling\" Trump chose to meet him first, describing it as \"a testimony to the strength of the American-Israeli alliance.\"",
      "\"This meeting will deal with important issues, critical issues facing Israel and our region, victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis and all its components \u2013 an axis that threatens the peace of Israel, the Middle East and the entire world,\" he said.",
      "There are currently 79 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including six dual US-Israeli citizens. \"Regarding agenda terms, Trump will want Netanyahu to proceed to the second phase of the truce agreement with Hamas.

      "While Trump has said he was \"not confident\" the ceasefire deal would hold, his Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff visited Israel last week and reportedly pushed for the implementation of all three phases. According to Netanyahu, Trump has committed to supporting the resumption of the war if negotiations with Hamas prove \"futile.\"",
      "\"There may also be discussion about the future of the Palestinian issue and ways in which the Trump peace plan unveiled during his first term can be revived, as well as how a normalization push between Israel and Saudi Arabia can be concluded,\" Oren said. \"I think the major pressure point would be the \u2018P\u2019 word, which refers to the Saudis insisting on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. Parts of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition and even some within his own party will not discuss the \u2018P\u2019 word.\"",

      "\"If not, the Iranians will be subject to a major operation that may be through an American-led coalition or different structures with or without Israel,\" he added, while referencing an Axios report last month that the U.S. president might \"either support an Israeli military strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities\u2026 or even order a U.S. strike.\" However, Ayalon said Trump will express a preference for a diplomatic solution, possibly placing him at odds with Netanyahu.",

      "\"A potential economic corridor from Asia to Europe through Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, maybe even the Palestinian Authority, works very well with Trump\u2019s agenda of countering aggressive Chinese expansionism through the Belt and Road Initiative,\" Ayalon said.",

Trump sees the problem of Gaza in a wider perspective\" that includes the Saudis, Qataris, Egyptians and other regional players, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Hannan Gefen, the former commander of IDF's elite Unit 8200, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Trump, in his second term, is repeating his willingness to withdraw from the Kurdish-controlled northeastern part of Syria, which may contrast with Israel\u2019s interest,\" he explained. \"In Lebanon, there might be a disagreement if Israel sees Hezbollah [violating the ceasefire and] regaining power, and wants to strike terror bases.

They see with clarity what is happening to their nation, and they understand the forces at play.\u00a0I firmly believe that truth and justice will ultimately prevail.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Wednesday prohibiting transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports. The measure, according to the White House press schedule, is called the \u201cNo Men in Women\u2019s Sports Executive Order.\u201d",
      "The timing does not appear to be coincidental: Wednesday is the 39th annual National Girls & Women in Sports Day, which was started in 1987 as a way to celebrate female athletes and inspire girls to participate in sports.",
      "The issue of transgender women participating in women\u2019s sports was a consistent and divisive topic leading up to the November elections. On the campaign trail \u2014\u00a0and even after he won the election \u2014\u00a0Trump referred to trans women as men and pledged to \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "The specifics of the transgender sports order are not yet public, but the order will likely involve how the Trump administration interprets Title IX, a civil rights law that prevents sex-based discrimination in education programs or activities that receive federal funding.",

Twenty-seven states already have laws, regulations or policies in place banning transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank.",
      "Two outspoken opponents of transgender women in women\u2019s spaces \u2014\u00a0Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and former college swimmer Riley Gaines \u2014 announced on social media that they would be at the signing.",
      "\u201cNo amount of activism, corporate pressure, or lies can erase reality\u2014men are biologically different from women,\u201d Mace wrote on X. \u201cThis executive order restores fairness, upholds Title IX\u2019s original intent, and defends the rights of female athletes who have worked their whole lives to compete at the highest levels.\u201d",
      "Gaines shared a photo on X of what appears to be an invitation to attend the signing and wrote, \u201cThings could\u2019ve been so different. Gender insanity was the final straw that brought a lot of moderates to the side of common sense. Specifically, I believe it was the issue of men in women\u2019s sports. I\u2019ve been living in a state of gratitude everyday since Nov 5th. Praise God.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the order being signed and publicly released, the Human Rights Campaign, the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, issued a statement warning of the consequences of a \u201cblanket ban\u201d on trans women and girls participating in female sports.",
      "\u201cThis order could expose young people to harassment and discrimination, emboldening people to question the gender of kids who don\u2019t fit a narrow view of how they\u2019re supposed to dress or look,\u201d HRC President Kelley Robinson stated. \u201cParticipating in sports is about learning the values of teamwork, dedication, and perseverance. And for so many students, sports are about finding somewhere to belong. We should want that for all kids \u2014 not partisan policies that make life harder for them.\u201d",
      "Trump has already signed three executive orders since taking office that directly target transgender people. On Inauguration Day, he signed an order proclaiming the government will only recognize two sexes, male and female, and that \u201cthese sexes are not changeable.\u201d He also signed orders barring transgender people from serving openly in the military and restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans people younger than 19 nationwide.",

      "The ME\u2019s office initially ruled her death a homicide, and later reclassified her death as a suicide in March of 2011 \u2014 a decision her family disagreed with.",
      "Ellen\u2019s parents, Joshua and Sandra Greenberg,\u00a0had filed two civil lawsuits against the city. On Monday, they reached a settlement prior to jury selection that will see Greenberg's manner of death re-investigated.",
      "Days before the settlement, Marlon Osbourne, who performed Greenberg\u2019s autopsy, said in a sworn verification statement filed Friday Jan. 31 that he now believes \u201cEllen\u2019s manner of death should be designated as something other than suicide,\u201d\u00a0NBC Philadelphia reported.",
      "He explained that he changed his decision after reviewing additional information in her police case file and after a consult from Dr. Lucy Rorke-Adams, who is a pediatric neuropathologist, the station reported.",
      "Attorneys representing the Greenbergs told NBC Philadelphia they were told the new review would be done expeditiously.",
      "\u201cHopefully that will be a new investigation. All the information that we\u2019ve acquired over the years will be presented. And I don\u2019t see any reason they wouldn\u2019t reach the same result that Dr. Osbourne gave,\u201d Joe Podraza, the Greenberg family attorney, said.",
      "\u201cI hope today we made Ellen proud of us and we were certainly very proud of her as her parents,\u201d Sandra Greenberg said after the settlement was reached to NBC Philadelphia. \u201cIt\u2019s monumental, for 14 years we\u2019ve been dealing with this suicidal label.\u201d",
      "The City of Philadelphia Law Department confirmed that the settlement includes an independent review of the autopsy file and \u201can express waiver of any claims that might be brought as a result of that process.\u201d"

    "summary": "SPARROWS POINT, Md. \u2014 Almost a year after the deadly collapse of Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge, Maryland officials on Tuesday unveiled their designs for its replacement, which will be taller and better protected against ship strikes.",
    "story": [
      "SPARROWS POINT, Md. \u2014 Almost a year after the deadly collapse of Baltimore\u2019s\u00a0Francis Scott Key Bridge, Maryland officials on Tuesday unveiled their designs for its replacement, which will be taller and better protected against ship strikes.",
      "Construction of the state\u2019s first cable-stayed bridge could be completed in 2028 and cost upwards of $1.7 billion.",
      "With its graceful outline and delicate design, officials said the new bridge will modernize Baltimore\u2019s skyline, becoming a symbol of resilience, progress and economic growth. The design features two towers with cables radiating down to the deck.",
      "\u201cThis is a great day for the state of Maryland,\u201d Gov. Wes Moore said at a news conference late Tuesday morning. \u201cBut it\u2019s not lost on me that today\u2019s triumph was born out of tragedy.\u201d",
      "The original Key Bridge, a 1.6-mile (2.6-kilometer) steel span at the mouth of Baltimore\u2019s harbor, took five years to construct and opened to traffic in 1977. It connected various port-oriented industrial communities around Baltimore and allowed drivers to easily bypass downtown.",
      "The bridge was destroyed when a massive container ship lost power and slammed into one of its supporting columns. The March 26 collapse\u00a0killed six construction workers\u00a0who were filling potholes when the structure crumbled beneath them. Baltimore\u2019s port was closed for months after the collapse, and\u00a0increased traffic congestion\u00a0remains a problem for drivers across the region.",
      "Officials quickly promised to rebuild the bridge \u2014 a\u00a0longstanding Baltimore landmark\u00a0and vital piece of transportation infrastructure.",
      "Demolition of the remaining pieces will take place this spring, with construction of its replacement to follow, officials said Tuesday.",
      "They held Tuesday\u2019s news conference at\u00a0Tradepoint Atlantic, a shipping hub in the Port of Baltimore that played a major role in cleanup and recovery efforts following the collapse. The facility is revitalizing the site of a former Bethlehem Steel plant just northeast of Baltimore as maritime shipping continues to fuel the regional economy.",
      "\u201cMaryland is a bridge between America and the rest of the world. We get cars from Michigan out to market. We bring sugars and spices to Louisiana. We haul farm equipment from the East Coast deep into the heartland,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCommerce and trade are the bedrock of our state, and we will continue to make investments that honor our tradition.\u201d",
      "In August, the state\u00a0awarded a $73 million contract\u00a0for the first phase of the rebuild to Kiewit Infrastructure, a major construction and engineering firm.",
      "Officials said the project would advance in two phases, with the first focusing on the design work and other necessary steps before construction begins. Moore promised to \u201cemploy many Marylanders\u201d throughout the process.",
      "Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said the design will include the latest in pier protection technology, which has become increasingly important as ships keep getting bigger and carrying more cargo. The bridge will also be taller to provide more clearance. He said the plans were developed with the project\u2019s cost and construction timeline in mind.",
      "\u201cWhile this is a beautiful bridge, it will also be a working bridge for a working city,\u201d Wiedefeld said.",
      "The federal government has agreed to cover the full price tag for rebuilding. Congress recently passed a spending bill that included a funding provision for the project.",
      "Officials have said they expect that federal taxpayers will eventually be made whole through insurance payouts and damages, but that could take a while. A\u00a0sprawling civil case\u00a0will ultimately determine the assignments of liability in what could become one of the most expensive maritime disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has not yet released its final report on the collapse, though officials said a loose cable in the ship\u2019s electrical switchboard likely contributed to its power issues. Federal agents boarded the cargo ship Dali amid a\u00a0criminal investigation\u00a0last year."

    "story": [
      "A Texas man convicted of beating and suffocating a Dallas area pastor in his own church during a robbery was facing execution on Wednesday, the second scheduled execution in the U.S. so far this year.",
      "Steven Lawayne Nelson was condemned for the 2011 killing of Rev. Clint Dobson, 28, who was beaten, strangled and suffocated with a plastic bag inside NorthPointe Baptist Church in Arlington. Dobson\u2019s secretary also was severely beaten and left for dead, but she survived.",
      "Nelson, 37, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. Nelson would be the first Texas death row inmate executed since Robert Roberson\u2019s Oct. 17, 2024,\u00a0execution date was delayed\u00a0in what would have been the first in the U.S. tied to a diagnosis of\u00a0shaken baby syndrome, and the first of four scheduled in Texas over the next three months.",
      "South Carolina carried out the nation\u2019s\u00a0first execution of 2025\u00a0on Friday. Marion Bowman Jr. was convicted of murder in the shooting death of a friend whose burned body was found in the trunk of a car in 2001.",
      "Nelson was a laborer and high school dropout with a long history of legal trouble and arrests that started as early as age 6. Nelson\u00a0recently married while on death row\u00a0and has pleaded for mercy, claiming that he had only served as a robbery lookout and blamed two other men for killing Dobson.",
      "Nelson testified at trial and has maintained that he waited outside the church for about 25 minutes before going in and seeing that Dobson and Judy Elliott had been beaten, and he insisted Dobson was still alive. Nelson said he took Dobson\u2019s laptop and that one of the other men gave him Elliott\u2019s car keys and credit cards.",
      "The victims were later found by Elliott\u2019s husband, the church\u2019s part-time music minister, who didn\u2019t immediately recognize her because she had been so severely beaten.",
      "Trial evidence showed Nelson\u2019s fingerprints and pieces of his broken belt at the crime scene, drops of the victims\u2019 blood on his sneakers, and surveillance video showing him driving Elliott\u2019s car and using her credit cards. Investigators also said the two men Nelson blamed for the attack had alibis: Phone records placed one of them 30 miles (48 kilometers) away, and phone records and a sign-in sheet placed the other man in a chemistry class.",
      "Nelson\u2019s attorneys appealed on claims of bad legal representation at his trial and sentencing, saying this lawyers did little to challenge the alibis of the other men, or present mitigating evidence of a troubled childhood in Oklahoma and Texas. His appeals have been denied by state and federal courts, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied a stay of execution on Jan. 28. Nelson\u2019s attorneys this week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and halt his execution, to give them more time to challenge his conviction.",
      "While awaiting trial, Nelson was indicted in the killing of another jail inmate. He was never tried on that charge after his guilty verdict and death sentence.\u00a0During his trial, Nelson broke an electronic shock cuff off his ankle, and later broke a water pipe in a holding cell, flooding the courtroom with foul black water. He also regularly unshackled his handcuffs and ankle restraints by using a key he was hiding in his genitals.",
      "Texas has three more executions scheduled before the end of April.",
      "The first is scheduled for Feb. 13. Richard Lee Tabler was condemned for gunning down a strip club manager and the manager\u2019s friend on Thanksgiving weekend in 2004. Tabler also acknowledged killing two dancers from the club. He was charged with their slayings but was never tried."

      "Search and recovery efforts are over after the crash last Wednesday, with 66 people identified, Washington officials said in a statement Tuesday. The chief medical examiner\u2019s office is still working to identify the final victim.",

      "Skies were clear on the night of the crash, so it does not appear that weather played a significant role.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The bromance between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has noticeably fizzled in the new term, although assistance to Ukraine has not yet been ratcheted up.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The bromance between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has noticeably fizzled in the new term, though Trump has yet to reveal the extent to which he\u2019ll pressure Russia to end its grinding war with Ukraine.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has dropped talk of Putin\u2019s strategic \"genius\" and \u201csavvy.\u201d In a conspicuous rhetorical shift, Trump has instead been warning that the Russian president he once called \"very smart\" is leading his country to ruin by prolonging the war.",
      "\u201cHe [Putin] should make a deal,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on his first day back in the White House. \u201cI think he\u2019s destroying Russia by not making a deal.\u00a0I think Russia is going to be in big trouble.\u201d",
      "The rationale behind the frostier tone is simple enough. Trump promised during the campaign to end the fighting within 24 hours of taking office, if not sooner. That deadline has passed, meaning the clock is ticking on Trump\u2019s vow to stop a costly, destructive war that began nearly three years ago when Russia invaded its democratic neighbor.",
      "Trump needs both Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to come to the table and negotiate a peace deal, which for Russia means abandoning any hope of swallowing up Ukraine in its entirety.",
      "Ukraine is prepared to bargain, Trump told the World Economic Forum three days after his inauguration. And Russia?",
      "\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to ask Russia,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHaving listened to Trump talk about Putin for almost a decade now, this is the most critical stuff he\u2019s ever said,\u201d Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, said in an interview.",
      "The Russian embassy did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Ways to pressure Putin",
      "Words alone won\u2019t compel Putin to give up the quest to subdue Ukraine, national security experts said. For that to happen, Trump will need to demonstrate to Putin that it\u2019s fruitless to continue fighting, they said.",
      "That will take some doing. Putin remains uninterested in peace talks as long as Russian troops continue to gain ground in Ukraine\u2019s east, albeit at a slow pace, and while Ukrainian forces hold seized territory in the Kursk region inside Russia, according to John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and other former officials.",
      "\u201cHe [Putin] doesn\u2019t want to negotiate now, because his troops are moving forward,\u201d Herbst said. \u201cHe wants to put more Ukrainian territory in his pocket when negotiations begin.\u201d",
      "Sergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, told NBC News in an interview that \u201cUkraine is open for negotiation, but it should be a negotiation. Not an ultimatum by Russia. In this case, Ukraine demonstrated a will to negotiate. Russia does not.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how far Trump will go in confronting Russia over Ukraine and whether he would be ready to ratchet up military assistance \u2014 including long-range missiles \u2014 to Kyiv.",
      "Trump has at his disposal a variety of tools that might make Putin more inclined to stop fighting. The question is, will he use them?",
      "The Trump administration briefly delayed the shipment of weapons to Ukraine last week but it was unclear exactly why, according to\u00a0a source with knowledge of the matter.\u00a0The shipments have since resumed.",
      "Depriving Ukraine of weapons would be a severe blow to Kyiv\u2019s war effort against its much larger neighbor.",
      "Asked about the pause, the White House\u2019s National Security Council pointed to Trump\u2019s comments about Ukraine during an Oval Office appearance on Monday.",
      "There, Trump told reporters that he would be open to linking financial assistance to something the U.S. wants in return: Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey [the Ukrainians] have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it.\"",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the White House\u2019s National Security Council, said in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump shared yesterday, the United States needs to recoup any money it spends or has spent on Ukraine aid. The discussions over the weekend centered around how best to ensure that repayment, and a timetable has yet to be established.\u201d",
      "Split in the Trump administration",
      "Trump\u2019s advisers and Cabinet members are split over how much pressure to bring to bear, with national security adviser Mike Waltz and Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg wanting to use American leverage to prod Putin to stand down, according to former U.S. and Ukrainian officials and a source close to the Kyiv government.",
      "Others favor cutting back the billions of dollars in assistance the U.S. gave to Ukraine in the Biden administration as a way of forcing a swift end to the conflict. Critics of that approach say it would effectively disarm Ukraine and thus amount to a capitulation to Russia.",
      "Before becoming vice president, then-Sen. JD Vance was a fierce skeptic of the money the Biden administration gave Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhy are spending $130 billion on Ukraine when we can\u2019t even pay our own bills at home?\u201d Vance said in one speech. He also called Ukraine\u2019s government \u201cthe most corrupt\u201d in Europe and possibly the world.",
      "Kellogg told NBC News in a statement, \u201cThe president\u2019s national security team is in sync.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president will use, as necessary, all levers of American strength to enable a conclusion to the carnage of the past three years,\u201d Kellogg added.",
      "A spokesperson for Vance declined comment Tuesday on his position on U.S. aid to Ukraine.",
      "Trump has laid out a few ideas for assisting Ukraine while the war continues.",
      "In a social media post two days after his swearing-in, he warned that he would slap Russia with tariffs, sanctions and taxes on the sale of Russian goods to the U.S. and other countries if Putin didn\u2019t negotiate an end to the war.",
      "A problem with that approach is that U.S. trade with Russia has fallen sharply, making tariffs less of a cudgel. Last year, the U.S. imported about $2.9 billion worth of goods from Russia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By contrast, in 2021, before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the figure was nearly $30 billion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total red herring,\u201d a former Biden administration national security official said of Trump\u2019s tariff threat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve totally disconnected the U.S. economy from the Russian economy,\u201d the former official added, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. \u201cSo, our ability to hurt Russia with tariffs is marginal.\u201d",
      "Another option would be for Trump to use Russia\u2019s own frozen assets, as opposed to U.S. tax dollars, to continue replenishing Ukraine supplies and weaponry.",
      "William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said that the $300 billion in Russian reserves sitting in European and U.S. banks \u201cwould go a long way to provide weapons and financial support to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat Trump could do is pressure the Europeans to seize those reserves and put them into an account for the Ukrainians and allow the Ukrainians to use that money to buy weapons from the U.S. and continue to operate their government,\u201d Taylor said in an interview.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump knows that the Russian economy is fragile and vulnerable to further sanctions. And thus, he knows that he has leverage on Putin,\u201d he added.",
      "A fear among Ukraine\u2019s supporters was that Trump would abandon the country upon returning to office. The warmth he had shown Putin over the years suggested he might bring about a settlement favorable to Russia, they worried.",
      "During a debate between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris last year, Trump did not say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.",
      "But now that he\u2019s in office, some who\u2019d questioned Trump could be a fair broker have been heartened to see that, at least, his team isn\u2019t selling out Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI think he [Trump] has started to realize how hard resolving this issue is and that Russia is not going to be constructive unless we apply more pressure,\u201d a U.S. official involved in Ukraine and Russia policy said in an interview, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.",
      "\u201cOne reason Trump\u2019s rhetoric has evolved is the switch from campaign to governing mode. The obstacle to peace is not Ukraine. I think that\u2019s sort of dawning on him, and it\u2019s also dawning on him how bad it would be politically, if nothing else, and strategically, if this f----- up.\u201d"

      "OREBRO, Sweden \u2014 Sweden's worst mass shooting\u00a0left at least 11 people dead, including the gunman, and at least five seriously wounded at an adult education center west of Stockholm.",
      "The gunman\u2019s motive hadn\u2019t been determined by early Wednesday as\u00a0the Scandinavian nation\u00a0\u2014 where gun violence at schools is very rare \u2014 reeled from an attack with such bloodshed that police early on said it was difficult to count the number of dead among the carnage.",
      "Officials said Wednesday that three women and two men, all with gunshot wounds, underwent surgery at Orebro University Hospital. All were in serious but stable condition after being admitted to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Another woman was treated for minor injuries and was stable.",
      "Jonas Claesson, regional director of health and medical services, said that two of the gunshot victims were in intensive care Wednesday. All of the victims are over age 18, officials said. No other patients related to the shooting were admitted to Orebro University Hospital overnight.",
      "The school, called Campus Risbergska, offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults age 20 and older, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. The school is on the outskirts of Orebro, which is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Stockholm.",
      "Justice Minister Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer called the shooting \u201can event that shakes our entire society to its core.\u201d King Carl XVI Gustaf and\u00a0Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson\u00a0ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the Royal Palace and government buildings.",
      "The king and Queen Silvia were in Orebro and would visit the school district and attend a memorial service in the city, the palace said. Kristersson and Str\u00f6mmer would also be there. Soccer teams Degerfors IF and Orebro Syrianska will wear black armbands at a preseason match on Wednesday evening and hold a minute\u2019s silence before kickoff, Degerfors said.",
      "The shooting started\u00a0Tuesday afternoon\u00a0after many students had gone home following a national exam. Students sheltered in nearby buildings, and other parts of the school were evacuated following the shooting.",
      "Authorities were working to identify the deceased. Police said that officers discovered the gunman dead at the school when they arrived. It was unclear how the gunman died.",
      "Roberto Eid Forest, head of the local police, said that the school\u2019s large premises meant it took a long time for officers to search the campus to ensure there were not any more victims. Police heard gunshots when they arrived and initially thought they were being fired upon, he said.",
      "Eid Forest said that six officers were treated for smoke inhalation. There wasn\u2019t a fire, he said, but authorities didn\u2019t immediately know what caused the smoke.",
      "Investigators will spend Wednesday seeking information from witnesses and checking any video footage of the attack. Police wouldn\u2019t say whether the shooter had multiple guns.",
      "There were no warnings beforehand, and police believe the perpetrator acted alone. Police haven\u2019t said if the man was a student at the school. They haven\u2019t released a\u00a0possible motive, but authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point.",
      "Police raided the suspect\u2019s home after Tuesday\u2019s shooting, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what they found. Police cautioned the public against spreading incorrect narratives on social media.",
      "\u201cToday, we have witnessed brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people,\u201d\u00a0the prime minister\u00a0told reporters in Stockholm late Tuesday. \u201cThis is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. Many questions remain unanswered, and I cannot provide those answers either.",
      "\u201cBut the time will come when we will know what happened, how it could occur, and what motives may have been behind it. Let us not speculate,\u201d he said.",
      "While gun violence at schools is very rare in Sweden, people were wounded or killed with\u00a0other weapons such as knives\u00a0or axes in several incidents in recent years."

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:35:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Greenland\u2019s parliament passed a bill that bans political parties from receiving contributions \u201cfrom foreign or anonymous contributors\u201d after President Donald Trump expressed his wish that the United States take over the island from Denmark.",
    "story": [
      "NUUK, Greenland \u2014 Greenland\u2019s parliament passed a bill Tuesday that bans political parties from receiving contributions \u201cfrom foreign or anonymous contributors\u201d after President Donald Trump expressed his wish that the United States take over the vast and mineral-rich Arctic island that belongs to Denmark.",
      "The bill is aimed at protecting \u201cGreenland\u2019s political integrity\u201d and will take effect immediately, according to a translation of a parliamentary document in Danish outlining the measure.",
      "The bill \u201cmust be seen in light of the geopolitical interests in Greenland and the current situation where representatives of an allied great power have expressed interest in taking over and controlling Greenland,\u201d the document said.",
      "Before taking office for his second term on Jan. 20, Trump said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, calling it vital to U.S. national security. His oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited Greenland last month and told citizens: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat you well.\u201d",
      "Denmark is a longtime U.S. ally and a founding member of NATO, and its semiautonomous territory is home to a large U.S. military base.",
      "With a total area of 836,000 square miles, Greenland \u2014 population about 57,000 \u2014 is over one-fifth the size of the United States, according to the CIA World Factbook.",
      "A senior legal officer at Greenland\u2019s parliament, Kent Fridberg, told The Associated Press he did not know whether any foreign donors had contributed to Greenland\u2019s political parties and that the idea for the bill was \u201cbasically a preventative measure.\u201d",
      "Fridberg noted that some Russian politicians had voiced a similar interest \u2014 and that political parties in Greenland are generally funded by public means.",
      "The new measure also prohibits any single party from receiving domestic private contributions that exceed 200,000 Danish kroner (about $27,700) in total, or 20,000 kroner (about $2,770) from a single contributor."

      "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iran\u2019s government seems to be welcoming some recent decisions by the United States \u2014 even though they happen to come from a man Iranian operatives have allegedly been plotting to assassinate.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s moves to freeze spending on foreign aid and overhaul, maybe even end, the U.S. Agency for International Development have been lauded in Iranian state media.",
      "The reports say the decisions will halt funding for opponents of the country\u2019s Shiite theocracy \u2014 pro-democracy activists and others supported through programs as part of U.S. government efforts to help democracy worldwide.",
      "At the same time, Iranian officials appear to be signaling that they are waiting for a message from Trump on whether he wants to negotiate over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program. At stake are potentially billions of dollars withheld from Iran through crushing sanctions and the future of a program on the precipice of enriching weapons-grade uranium.",
      "And even when signing an executive order to reimpose his \u201cmaximum pressure on Iran\u201d on Tuesday, Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran.",
      "Meanwhile, ordinary Iranians worry what all this could mean for them. On Wednesday, Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, plunged to a record low of 850,000 to $1 after Trump\u2019s order, showing the ongoing economic volatility they face. A decade ago, it stood at 32,000 rials to $1.",
      "\u201cIt encourages hard-liners inside Iran to continue repressions because they feel the U.S. would have less capability in supporting Iranian people who seek freedom,\u201d said Maryam Faraji, a 27-year-old waitress in a coffee shop in northern Tehran.",
      "The state-run IRNA news agency said that \u201ccutting the budget of foreign-based opposition\u201d could \u201caffect the sphere of relations\u201d between Tehran and Washington.",
      "Newspapers, like the conservative Hamshhari daily, described Iran\u2019s opposition as \u201ccounterrevolutionaries\u201d who had been \u201ccelebrating\u201d Trump\u2019s election as heralding the \u201clast days of life of the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "They then \u201csuddenly faced the surprise of cut funding from their employer,\u201d the newspaper crowed.",
      "Even the reformist newspaper Hammihan compared it to a \u201ccold shower\u201d for opponents of Iran\u2019s theocracy abroad, an idea also expressed by the Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cThose financial resources are not charity donations,\u201d Esmail Bagahei, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. \u201cThey are wages paid in exchange for services.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a clear sign of America\u2019s interventionist policy particularly during the Biden administration, which tried to pressure Iran and meddle in its domestic affairs through financial aid,\u201d Bagahei added.",
      "It remains unclear how funding for Iranian activists and opposition figures would be affected by the USAID decision.",
      "Iran also noticed that the U.S. avoided direct criticism of the Islamic Republic during a review by the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva last week. For those in Iran\u2019s government, there\u2019s anticipation this could mean that Trump is willing to negotiate, something he repeatedly brought up in his election campaign as a possibility.",
      "Even Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in September opened the door to talks with the U.S., saying there is \u201cno harm\u201d in engaging with the \u201cenemy.\u201d More recently, he tempered that, warning that sinister plots could still be \u201cconcealed behind diplomatic smiles.\u201d",
      "While Bagahei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged Iran hasn\u2019t seen any \u201cgreen light\u201d yet for talks, Iran is trying to do everything it can to signal it wants them.",
      "The country\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on outreach to the West, urged officials on Monday to listen to dissent from the Iranian people and avoid further crackdowns like those that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cThe enemies are hoping that by stirring up disputes within the country, they will throw people into the streets and then ride the wave of protests themselves,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "As he signed the executive order on Iran on Tuesday, Trump warned the country would be \u201cobliterated\u201d if he was assassinated by Tehran. But he still left the door open for talks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to sign it, but hopefully we\u2019re not going to have to use it very much,\u201d he said from the Oval Office. \u201cWe will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.\u201d",
      "However, factions within Iran\u2019s theocracy are still likely to oppose talks, whether out of their own self-interest or over anger that Trump ordered the 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the country\u2019s top general and a revered figure.",
      "That killing fueled Iranian calls for Trump\u2019s assassination \u2014 and alleged plots against him. In November, the Justice Department disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump. While Iran denied being involved, Tehran has a history of plotting the killing of opponents abroad.",
      "\u201cThis will not have any impact on the factions that oppose talks with the U.S., but maybe some moderates find it as an excuse to say that Trump is taking some steps,\u201d Iranian political analyst Ahmad Zeiabadi said."

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 16:13:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The president signed three orders restricting transgender rights, including limits on military service and access to gender-affirming care.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Wednesday prohibiting transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports. The measure, according to the White House press schedule, is called the \u201cNo Men in Women\u2019s Sports Executive Order.\u201d",
      "The timing does not appear to be coincidental: Wednesday is the 39th annual National Girls & Women in Sports Day, which was started in 1987 as a way to celebrate female athletes and inspire girls to participate in sports.",
      "The issue of transgender women participating in women\u2019s sports was a consistent and divisive topic leading up to the November elections. On the campaign trail \u2014\u00a0and even after he won the election \u2014\u00a0Trump referred to trans women as men and pledged to \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "The specifics of the transgender sports order are not yet public, but the order will likely involve how the Trump administration interprets Title IX, a civil rights law that prevents sex-based discrimination in education programs or activities that receive federal funding.",
      "A Gallup survey of U.S. adults conducted in May 2023 found that nearly 70% of respondents said trans athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that correspond with their birth sex, up from 62% in 2021. Twenty-seven states already have laws, regulations or policies in place banning transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank.",
      "Two outspoken opponents of transgender women in women\u2019s spaces \u2014\u00a0Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and former college swimmer Riley Gaines \u2014 announced on social media that they would be at the signing.",
      "\u201cNo amount of activism, corporate pressure, or lies can erase reality\u2014men are biologically different from women,\u201d Mace wrote on X. \u201cThis executive order restores fairness, upholds Title IX\u2019s original intent, and defends the rights of female athletes who have worked their whole lives to compete at the highest levels.\u201d",
      "Gaines shared a photo on X of what appears to be an invitation to attend the signing and wrote, \u201cThings could\u2019ve been so different. Gender insanity was the final straw that brought a lot of moderates to the side of common sense. Specifically, I believe it was the issue of men in women\u2019s sports. I\u2019ve been living in a state of gratitude everyday since Nov 5th. Praise God.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the order being signed and publicly released, the Human Rights Campaign, the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, issued a statement warning of the consequences of a \u201cblanket ban\u201d on trans women and girls participating in female sports.",
      "\u201cThis order could expose young people to harassment and discrimination, emboldening people to question the gender of kids who don\u2019t fit a narrow view of how they\u2019re supposed to dress or look,\u201d HRC President Kelley Robinson stated. \u201cParticipating in sports is about learning the values of teamwork, dedication, and perseverance. And for so many students, sports are about finding somewhere to belong. We should want that for all kids \u2014 not partisan policies that make life harder for them.\u201d",
      "Trump has already signed three executive orders since taking office that directly target transgender people. On Inauguration Day, he signed an order proclaiming the government will only recognize two sexes, male and female, and that \u201cthese sexes are not changeable.\u201d He also signed orders barring transgender people from serving openly in the military and restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans people younger than 19 nationwide.",

      "The cause of death of Philadelphia school teacher Ellen Greenberg, who was found brutally stabbed in 2011, will be reinvestigated after a pathologist who previously ruled her death a suicide reversed course last week.",
      "Greenberg was 27 when she was found dead on Jan. 26 2011 with a kitchen knife lodged in her chest. She was discovered inside the Philadelphia apartment she shared with her fianc\u00e9, Samuel Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg had returned home from the gym that evening to discover he was locked out of the apartment because the swing bar lock was engaged from the inside. He eventually was able to force the door open, where he found Ellen and called 911, according to the Philadelphia Medical Examiner\u2019s investigation report.",
      "She had 20 stab wounds, including 10 to her neck and head according to her autopsy report.",
      "Police said they observed no forced entry into the apartment, no defense wounds and no evidence of a struggle and said it appeared Greenberg died by suicide.",
      "The ME\u2019s office initially ruled her death a homicide, and later reclassified her death as a suicide in March of 2011 \u2014 a decision her family disagreed with.",
      "Ellen\u2019s parents, Joshua and Sandra Greenberg,\u00a0had filed two civil lawsuits against the city. On Monday, they reached a settlement prior to jury selection that will see Greenberg's manner of death re-investigated.",
      "Days before the settlement, Marlon Osbourne, who performed Greenberg\u2019s autopsy, said in a sworn verification statement filed Friday Jan. 31 that he now believes \u201cEllen\u2019s manner of death should be designated as something other than suicide,\u201d\u00a0NBC Philadelphia reported.",
      "He explained that he changed his decision after reviewing additional information in her police case file and after a consult from Dr. Lucy Rorke-Adams, who is a pediatric neuropathologist, the station reported.",
      "Attorneys representing the Greenbergs told NBC Philadelphia they were told the new review would be done expeditiously.",
      "\u201cHopefully that will be a new investigation. All the information that we\u2019ve acquired over the years will be presented. And I don\u2019t see any reason they wouldn\u2019t reach the same result that Dr. Osbourne gave,\u201d Joe Podraza, the Greenberg family attorney, said.",
      "\u201cI hope today we made Ellen proud of us and we were certainly very proud of her as her parents,\u201d Sandra Greenberg said after the settlement was reached to NBC Philadelphia. \u201cIt\u2019s monumental, for 14 years we\u2019ve been dealing with this suicidal label.\u201d",
      "The City of Philadelphia Law Department confirmed that the settlement includes an independent review of the autopsy file and \u201can express waiver of any claims that might be brought as a result of that process.\u201d"

      "Baseless allegations that referees are the bag for Kansas City have been running rampant for years, to the point where NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had to address it this week as the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles prep for Sunday's Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cCommissioner Goodell\u2019s comments that it is \u2018ridiculous\u2019 to presume that NFL Officials are not doing everything possible to make the right call on every play is spot on,\u201d according to a statement by NFLRA executive director Scott Green.",
      "\u201cOfficiating crews do not work the same team more than twice each regular season. It is insulting and preposterous to hear conspiracy theories that somehow 17 officiating crews consisting of 138 officials are colluding to assist one team.\u201d",
      "The union pointed out that its members are graded \"every week, on every single play of each game\" and that \"grades are the determining factor as to who receives postseason assignments.\"",
      "\u201cThere are many things that fans can worry about over a 17-game season, such as coaching decisions, player injuries, the weather and, yes, even close calls on incredible plays made by incredible athletes,\u201d Green continued.",

      "And in those 20 postseason games, Kansas City has been assessed more penalty yardage than the opposing team just three times.",
      "The penalty tilt has been particularly sharp in the past 12 K.C. postseason contests as\u00a0Chiefs opponents have been hit by more yellow flags 11 times with one tie. K.C. opponents have endured more penalty yardage in 11 of those dozen matches.",
      "The Chiefs/referees issue led to high-level comedy earlier this week when former Boston radio show host Rich Shertenlieb trolled both Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce about the alleged zebra favoritism.",
      "\u201cPatrick, for your whole career you have had so many great people help you win,\" Shertenlieb asked Mahomes. \"So, who is your favorite ref?\u201d",

      "Kelce seemed less entertained when Shertenlieb asked: \u201cTravis, what do you love more: Taylor Swift\u00a0or phantom\u00a015-yard roughing the passer penalties\u00a0in the playoffs?\u201d",

    "summary": "What is the story and controversy behind Bianca Censori's Grammys dress? Did she break the law? Why are people worried?",
    "story": [
      "Bianca Censori caused a stir at the Grammys this year when she appeared on the red carpet wearing a barely-there dress.",
      "The Australian architectural designer and model, 30, arrived at the ceremony with her partner, the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.",
      "Ye was nominated alongside\u00a0Ty Dolla $Ign, Rich The Kid, and Playboi Carti in the Best Rap Song category for \u201cCarnival.\u201d The last time Ye attended the Grammys was in 2015.",
      "\u201cNude\" dresses are nothing new on the red carpet, but Censori\u2019s provocative look seemed to go a step further than other past revealing outfits at major awards events.",
      "Her barely perceptible garment went viral and also raised questions on social media about indecent exposure laws.",
      "Read on to learn more about what Censori wore to the Grammys and whether she could face possible legal ramifications tied to their red carpet appearance.",
      "What did Bianca Censori wear to the Grammys, and why did it spark concern?",
      "Censori arrived at the Grammys on Feb. 2 wearing a long black coat. She coordinated with her partner, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who also wore an all-black ensemble.",
      "As they posed for photographers, Censori slipped off the jacket and revealed a skintight, fully see-through dress.",
      "Ye shared a photo of the dress on Instagram on Feb. 4 with the caption, \u201cTHE INVISIBLE DRESS.\u201d",
      "The dress provoked major discussion and backlash on social media, raising questions about the nature of Ye and Censori's relationship and if the outfit \u2014\u00a0which was designed by his brand, Yeezy \u2014 was her choice.",
      "Psychologist Channa Bromley told TODAY.com in an email clothing is a \"a form of self-expression, autonomy, and identity.\"",
      "Bromley suggests Censori's Grammys is a \"case study\" into a partner potentially exerting undue influence over another's choice of clothes. If the choice of outfit were Censori's, Bromley says it would be \"marked by confidence, ease and ownership of the moment.\" If it wasn't, Bromley says you might see \"micro-expressions of discomfort, hesitation, forced compliance.\"",
      "\u201cIn controlling relationships, dress codes can serve as both a test of submission and a display of ownership. The more extreme the shift, the more likely it\u2019s a symptom of something deeper than just evolving style,\u201d Bromley says.",
      "Bromley says the video of her disrobing may strike viewers as \"unsettling\" because of the \"psychology behind it.\"",
      "\"The lack of natural confidence, the robotic compliance, the vacant expression, it doesn\u2019t read as a woman fully in charge of her choices,\" she says.",
      "Psychologist Kelsey Latimer says that changing clothing style in a relationship isn't necessarily a red flag. \"Are you making choices because you want to? Has your style simply changed and you like trying something new?\" she asks. But \"making changes in one\u2019s attire out of fear of what will happen if you don\u2019t\" or \"worry that your partner will get jealous that others might admire you\" are signs of an unhealthy relationship.",
      "Latimer says she's not surprised the outfit provoked such a response and questions into Censori's well-being. \"For most of us, wearing something that is extremely exposing would create a sense of vulnerability so if the person themselves is not making that choice then that can lead to a sense of physical or emotional vulnerability and lack of internal safety,\" she says.",
      "The message a nude dress sends",
      "Revealing looks are nothing new on the red carpet; other stars, including Chrissy Teigen, Shakira and Victoria Mon\u00e9t, sported dresses with sheer or cutout elements at the Grammys this year.",
      "Stars in general have been pushing the envelope for decades with daring looks and in one sense, Censori\u2019s latest look is just the continuation of that trend, fashion historian and professor Deirdre Clemente told TODAY.com in an email.",
      "\u201cCensori\u2019s nude dress is the culmination of more than a century of 'barely there' eveningwear,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, her dress is as shocking in its extremeness, as the dresses of the 1920s were 100 years ago.\u201d",
      "However, even today\u2019s \u201cnude\u201d looks generally contain some degree of coverage, however scant, whereas Censori\u2019s dress gave her the appearance of being fully naked.",
      "In this sense, Censori\u2019s dress differs from the risqu\u00e9 looks of other famously provocative style icons.",
      "\u201cWhy Censori\u2019s dress is different from previous incarnations of Marilyn Monroe or Kim Kardasian, is that it breaks a fundamental rule of fashion. And it does that on purpose,\u201d Clemente said.",
      "\u201cFor millennia, fashion has been used to simultaneously \u2018hide\u2019 and \u2018flaunt\u2019 the female form. It is in that tension that fashion exists,\u201d she continued. \u201cCensori\u2019s dress takes away the tension between \u2018wondering\u201d and \u2018knowing\u2019 that has defined evening wear for centuries.\u201d",
      "Will Censori face any legal consequences for her look?",
      "Following the Grammys, some wondered online whether Censori had broken any laws with her daring outfit.",
      "\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Bianca Censori being arrested for indecent exposure?\u201d one person wrote on X.",
      "\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t consent to seeing you naked\u2026.That is called INDECENT EXPOSURE and it is a CRIME,\u201d another person commented. \u201cI never consented to seeing this woman naked and I\u2019m sure a lot of people with their children watching didn\u2019t either. This is really disturbing.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to TODAY.com that \u201can investigation has not been opened\u201d into Censori\u2019s Grammys look.",
      "In this situation, a criminal charge is very unlikely, Dmitry Gorin, a criminal defense attorney with the Los Angeles law firm Eisner Gorin LLP, told TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSomebody would have to report the offense to the police, and I just see Los Angeles police having plenty of other work than investigating indecent exposure,\u201d he said.",
      "Besides, even if someone did decide to bring charges, Gorin says Censori\u2019s nude look does not meet the elements of Penal Code 314, the California statute that prohibits indecent exposure.",
      "The code states that to be considered \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d an act \u201cmust be done in a manner that the defendant had intent to draw public attention to their genitals for sexual gratification or to offend another person.\u201d",
      "Gorin argues that in Censori\u2019s case, context matters. He argues she was appearing at the Grammys in the capacity of a model, meaning that it would be expected that she would display her body in some way.",
      "\u201cI think in this situation, she\u2019s a model, she knew she\u2019d be getting a lot of attention,\u201d Gorin said. \u201cIf she was ever charged, her lawyer would say, \u2018Look, this is just a model showing off her body.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also noted that because she was appearing as a model and public figure, there was likely a secondary \u201ccommercial\u201d motivation for her red carpet appearance, and that it was unlikely she was driven solely by an intent to \u201csexually gratify\u201d or \u201coffend.\u201d",
      "Gorin also points out that the Grammys are known as a place where people try out daring looks on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a place to show off, to wear dresses and clothes that strike media and public attention,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cI have to say, he changed mine, forever,\u201d Smith said, adding, \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones.\u201d",
      "Smith continued by praising the late Jones for dabbling in multiple genres, including jazz, and \u201cbringing the best out in legends from Brother Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald Count Basie to Aretha Franklin.\u201d",
      "He also touched on Jones\u2019 relationship with Frank Sinatra and how their musical partnership \u201copened doors and took both men to new heights.\u201d",
      "Smith's introduction to Jones' special tribute included performances by Cynthia Erivo ,who performed \u201cFly Me To The Moon,\u201d followed by Lainey Wilson singing \u201cLet The Good Times Roll\u201d with Jacob Collier.",
      "It also included Stevie Wonder, who performed \u201cBluesette\u201d and \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d and student singers from two schools that were lost in the Eaton and Palisades fires.",
      "Smith returned to the stage and shared a story about his relationship with Jones.",
      "\"Quincy Jones was a mentor, friend and father figure,\" Smith said, sharing how, as an executive producer of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" Jones gave him a \"shot\" at the age of 22.",
      "He recalled having a hard time on set and Jones giving him a speech about the quality of food that was on the set. \"'You want these people to work 16 or 18 hours a day so you realize your dreams, and this is the food you think they should eat?', he said, 'I don't care if it's not in a budget. You pay for it out of your own pocket.'\"",
      "From there, Smith said that Jones' following words reframed his whole career: \"It is your job to take care of these people.\"",
      "\"And I've done everything I can through my career to try to live up to Quincy's demand,\" he said, before concluding, \"Quincy Jones always took care of people, and that's how he fed the world. Quincy taught us all that life is a feast, and you don't stop till you get enough.\"",
      "Janelle Mon\u00e1e closed out the epic tribute by singing, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Till You Get Enough.\u201d",
      "Jones, who worked with legends like Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, died Nov. 3, 2024 at the age of 91. Smith has previously credited the producer and artist for encouraging his acting career and landing him the leading role in \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\u201d",
      "In a tribute after Jones\u2019 death, Smith called him \u201cthe true definition of a Mentor, a Father and a Friend.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe pointed me toward the greatest parts of myself. He defended me. He nurtured me. He encouraged me. He inspired me. He checked me when he needed to,\u201d Smith wrote on Instagram. \u201cHe let me use his wings until mine were strong enough to fly.\u201d",
      "Hosted by Trevor Noah for the fifth year in a row, the 2025 Grammys are raising funds to support wildfire relief efforts and help music professionals impacted by the\u00a0wildfires in Los Angeles.",
      "This marks Smith\u2019s first appearance at a major awards ceremony since he slapped Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards. The altercation occurred after the comedian made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, which Smith did not find funny.",
      "The \u201cKind Richard\u201d star apologized to Rock, however, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences banned Smith from all Academy events for 10 years.",
      "The Oscar winner recently announced that he will release his first album in 20 years, and dropped the first single, \u201cBeautiful Scars,\u201d featuring Big Sean."

    "story": [
      "Ye, the rapper, producer and songwriter formerly known as Kanye West, is known for making headlines, but it\u2019s his significant other who may have stolen his thunder at the Grammy Awards.",
      "Ye\u2019s partner, Bianca Censori, arrived at the Grammys red carpet on Feb. 2 in a see-through dress.",
      "Censori and Ye, who was nominated for best rap song for \u201cCarnival,\u201d posed for photos on the red carpet, with Censori donning a fur coat. But at the two stopped for photos, she turned her back to the paparazzi and took off her coat to reveal what looked like nothing but her birthday suit. She then turned around to show off her body, covered in a sheer, transparent outfit.",
      "As she posed, Ye, who was decked out in black pants, a short-sleeved black shirt and sunglasses, didn\u2019t change his emotionless expression, while photographers continued to snap pictures before he shuffled a few steps off to the side.",
      "Over the years, Ye has coupled up with a number of partners in the public eye: model Amber Rose, who dated him in the late aughts;\u00a0former wife\u00a0and reality TV royalty Kim Kardashian, who shares four children with Ye; and\u00a0model-actor Julia Fox, who had a brief relationship with Ye following his 2022 split from Kardashian.",
      "Censori is more of a mystery than those of his past. Before stepping out with\u00a0the controversial entertainer, who legally changed his name to Ye in 2021, she rarely stepped into the spotlight at all.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Bianca Censori.",
      "Are Bianca Censori and Kanye West married?",
      "Though Censori and Ye have remarked about being married, NBC News has been unable verify if they have obtained a marriage license.",
      "In early 2023, paparazzi spotted Ye, 46, wearing a silver band on his ring finger as the couple dined at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills. Rumors about a possible marriage sparked shortly after, though Ye nor Censori ever officially announced a wedding or marriage.",
      "What is Bianca Censori\u2019s age?",
      "She now 30, according to a\u00a0since-deleted Instagram post\u00a0from Ye that celebrated her birthday in 2024.",
      "Where does Bianca Censori work?",
      "Censori is head of architecture for Ye\u2019s fashion brand, Yeezy. According to\u00a0a LinkedIn page attributed to her, she joined the company in 2020.",
      "Where is Bianca Censori from?",
      "Censori was born in Australia, and as the LinkedIn account notes, she attended grammar school in the Melbourne suburb of Kew, Victoria, and earned degrees in architecture at the University of Melbourne.",
      "In a June 2022\u00a0Vogue Australia\u00a0story about Australian creatives, Censori spoke about splitting her time between her hometown and the place she called home in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI find making ideas come to fruition much easier in Australia,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cIn Melbourne I can cultivate my creativity, and L.A. is where I apply it.\u201d"

      "The Mountain Dude slides across the table of Becky G's kitchen, offering her a bottle of Mountain Dew Baja Blast, which features a tropical lime flavor. She accepts the bottle and takes a sip. This action immediately sends her through a portal of some sort, landing her in a boat (with the Mountain Dude) floating in the waters of \"Baja Beach.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hanson Talk \u2018Underneath,\u2019 Hair Tips and Dreams of Collabing With Haim",
      "Back in 1997, the trio of brothers known as Hanson made their TODAY debut and have been dropping by Studio 1A ever since. Their latest visit, however, celebrated a bigger occasion \u2014 the release of \u201cUnderneath: Complete,\u201d a reissue of the band\u2019s 2004 album.",
      "During their September visit, the group took up their instruments to perform new versions of their nostalgic hits and talk about their journey since boy band superstardom. Former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian Kate McKinnon even joined to share the impact they had on her life ... and her hairstyle.",
      "Brothers Isaac, Taylor and Zac started the band Hanson as young children in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and rose to fame in the late 1990s.",
      "They are best known for their chart-topping 1997 single \u201cMMMBop,\u201d from their album \u201cMiddle of Nowhere,\u201d which earned them three Grammy nominations.",
      "The teenage trio, and their signature long blond hair, quickly grew a massive fan base around the world.",
      "In 2003, Hanson formed their own label, 3CG Records, and released their first independent studio album, \u201cUnderneath,\u201d in 2004. The brothers have been making music since, releasing a total of 12 studio albums.",
      "Today, the Hanson brothers are all grown up and have 15 children between the three of them. They are still collaborating on new projects and even started a craft beer business, Hanson Brothers Beer, which features a pale ale aptly named \u201cMmmhops.\u201d",
      "In October 2024, to celebrate 20 years of 3CG, Hanson released the deluxe edition of \u201cUnderneath,\u201d which features new versions of hits like \u201cPenny & Me\u201d and bonus tracks.",
      "Ahead of their appearance on TODAY, the Hanson brothers sat down for \u201c8 Before 8,\u201d our original video series in which we ask artists eight questions before 8 a.m. Isaac, Taylor and Zac reflected on the last 20 years, discussed what the future holds and revealed the meaning behind \u201cMMMBop.\u201d (Plus, they even shared the secrets behind their iconic hair.)",
      "What made you decide to revisit an album from 20 years ago?",
      "Taylor Hanson: This album is special for a bunch of reasons. One, it launched us into an independent period. We launched a label, (so) it was a time where it was about taking chances and investing in our fans. ... It\u2019s really (a) \u201cthank you\u201d to a lot of fans that have stuck with us. Here we are, 20 years later, many albums later, many laps around the world later, and we really feel like we owe that to them, and so we wanted to do something special to celebrate.",
      "Zac Hanson: \u201cUnderneath\u201d was an album that had about 80 songs written for it. It seemed like a special way to remember that that record was to include some of the songs that did make it to a full recording, and include in that story the people that were involved \u2014 like Carole King, who we wrote songs with, and Bob Marlette, who produced, and Greg Wells. ... So by adding more music to it and getting to revisit some of the songs, it sort of completes the story of that record and all that were involved.",
      "What does \u201cPenny & Me\u201d mean to you now?",
      "Isaac Hanson: \u201cPenny & Me\u201d was a really important part of the story of \u201cUnderneath.\u201d It\u2019s the very first single that we released from that record, but it was one of the very last songs that we recorded for the record. ... We knew this song would find a special place, and it certainly has found a special place \u2014 not only for us personally, but with the fan base.",
      "Zac: \u201cPenny & Me\u201d is also a song that really has a lot of references to other people\u2019s music that inspired us, (it\u2019s) sort of a love letter to that. ... The new version of \u201cPenny & Me\u201d \u2014 we call it the \u201cMoonlight\u201d version \u2014 takes that another step further, in not just referencing songs like \u201cFeelin\u2019 Alright?\u201d or \u201cPink Moon\u201d by Nick Drake, but actually saying, what if we leaned into that style and did it in a different way?",
      "Taylor: \u201cPenny & Me\u201d has brought people together in many ways. ... We said let\u2019s do a new music video that brings things back. We had Samaire\u00a0Armstrong reprise her role as Penny in the video. I have a daughter named Penny, who played the 20-years-later Penny. Then Natalie Morales, who was a Hanson fan who became a successful director and writer \u2014 (she) became the director this. So you have all these things converging.",
      "What is the meaning of \u201cMMMBop\u201d?",
      "Zac: \u201cMMMBop\u201d is a song really about (how) we all have to make choices in life \u2014 some relationships will last and some will be short-lived. Even as a young person, we saw that you had to choose the path you wanted to be on and fight for the relationships and people you want to be in your life. ... The chorus is really about the passage of time (and) how things will come and go, and the verses talk about how you\u2019re going to have to grab and reach for the stuff that you want to be a part of your life.",
      "Taylor: We\u2019ve always loved the idea of putting a little bit of optimism into, well, there\u2019s a problem, a challenge, but this is where we\u2019re trying to go \u2014\u00a0and really, that\u2019s what \u201cMMMBop\u201d is. It\u2019s saying all these things are challenging, but you can\u2019t change it. You have to embrace the moment. You have to be here right now.",
      "What advice would you give to young new artists?",
      "Zac: The first thing that we did was listen to other artists we loved and learn to sing their songs. That\u2019s important. In a way, the apprenticeship of every musician is to first mimic. But the most important thing will be what you do that no one else does. The way you present your personality and your story and put your own words into your songs and your ideas. It\u2019s your voice that\u2019s going to be the thing that lasts generations if you have that moment to connect with people.",
      "Isaac: Writing songs is a really, really important element of your creativity, because at the end of the day, you\u2019re the one standing out there singing them. So you better have your signature on it in some way, shape or form. And the best way is to learn to be a good writer.",
      "What is your kids' relationship to music like?",
      "Zac: Taylor\u2019s seven kids, my five, Isaac\u2019s three \u2014 it\u2019s a brood.",
      "Taylor: There\u2019s absolutely a few musicians. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be a cousin band ... but I think there\u2019s natural collaboration. There is some music being made between the cousins, because they\u2019re around each other and around music. ... It\u2019ll be something that we can\u2019t predict \u2014 who decides to embrace it and make this their life \u2014 but I would guess we\u2019ll have a few. Between the 15, the odds are with us.",
      "What are some of your next goals as a band?",
      "Taylor: We\u2019ve gotten to do some really amazing musical things. A couple years ago, we worked with symphonies all over the world. ... Honestly, (it\u2019s) writing, producing and taking your passion and getting behind other creators too \u2014 being that person to do what others did for us when we started. ... So I think you\u2019ll see us champion other artists, supporting and helping make those things happen.",
      "Dream band collaboration?",
      "Isaac: We are always into the idea of collaboration. ... We\u2019ve kind of joked about back and forth with the girls in Haim. Haim-son!",
      "Zac: Brothers and sisters together.",
      "Isaac: The cool thing is, you (Zac) are a drummer \u2014 they don\u2019t have a drummer in their band.",
      "Zac: We don\u2019t have a bass player.",
      "Isaac: Este\u2019s a bass player, so, you know, we finally have a complete band.",
      "What was your hair-care routine for your iconic looks?",
      "Isaac: I wish that we had an ability to say something to people about (our) hair anything other than I use random shampoos.",
      "Zac: I only wash my hair about once every six weeks. ... The answer is that, I think, just stop putting chemicals in and let your body just do the work.",
      "Isaac: You only wash your hair every six weeks? I wash my hair like the every three days.",
      "Zac: Every six weeks, probably, I put shampoo in my hair. Just putting it out there: Rinse it all the time, but don't put soap in it.",
      "Taylor: The Hanson hair-care line is really a long time coming, we should just go ahead with that and it\u2019s going to basically involve not doing much.",
      "Zac: The hair care line would be like an empty bottle."

I\u2019ve known this the whole time \u2014 this is not news to me,\u201d she joked in an interview with Spectrum News on Nov. 19, 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to see those things sort of rolling in because at the end of the day, he\u2019s still tucking in toddlers at the end of the night and getting called in for kid duty.\u201d",
      "She and Taylor Swift have had NFL moments together",
      "Travis Kelce started stepping out with Taylor Swift in September 2023. While Swift went to many games, and was photographed with the Kelce brothers' parents, it took a while for her and Kylie Kelce to be photographed together.",
      "Swift and Kylie Kelce posed with friends and other WAGs when the Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0faced off against the Buffalo Bills\u00a0at Highmark Stadium in Buffalo, New York, on Jan. 21, 2024.",

      "He added that when he exercises, he interacts better with his children and is \u201ca better person.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not,\u201d Jason Kelce responded. \u201cI\u2019ve seen better. It\u2019s not that sharp. But it\u2019s for show. It\u2019s a symbol.\u201d",
      "In a previous episode of \u201cNew Heights,\u201d Jason Kelce admitted he was about a month overdue for a wedding anniversary gift for Kylie. The traditional theme for a sixth anniversary is iron, so the Kelce brothers took that and ran with it.",

      "\u201cRight now, sword is definitely better than what I\u2019ve currently gotten her,\u201d Jason Kelce joked. \u201cIf she ever wants to break the covenant we\u2019ve made with the Lord, she can use her sword. It\u2019s very symbolic.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf we have a whole Robert Durst situation going on, we know what happened to Jason,\u201d Travis Kelce said. \u201cJason got killed in the basement. Kylie did it in the basement with the iron sword. It\u2019s like the movie \u2018Clue.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cListen, I\u2019m just going to be honest with you \u2014 if Kylie killed me with the sword, I had it coming to me,\u201d Jason Kelce joked. \u201cNo need to punish her. I think we can all safely assume that if Jason was killed by Kylie, he had it coming. No investigation needed.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The bromance between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has noticeably fizzled in the new term, although assistance to Ukraine has not yet been ratcheted up.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The bromance between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has noticeably fizzled in the new term, though Trump has yet to reveal the extent to which he\u2019ll pressure Russia to end its grinding war with Ukraine.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has dropped talk of Putin\u2019s strategic \"genius\" and \u201csavvy.\u201d In a conspicuous rhetorical shift, Trump has instead been warning that the Russian president he once called \"very smart\" is leading his country to ruin by prolonging the war.",
      "\u201cHe [Putin] should make a deal,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on his first day back in the White House. \u201cI think he\u2019s destroying Russia by not making a deal.\u00a0I think Russia is going to be in big trouble.\u201d",
      "The rationale behind the frostier tone is simple enough. Trump promised during the campaign to end the fighting within 24 hours of taking office, if not sooner. That deadline has passed, meaning the clock is ticking on Trump\u2019s vow to stop a costly, destructive war that began nearly three years ago when Russia invaded its democratic neighbor.",
      "Trump needs both Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to come to the table and negotiate a peace deal, which for Russia means abandoning any hope of swallowing up Ukraine in its entirety.",
      "Ukraine is prepared to bargain, Trump told the World Economic Forum three days after his inauguration. And Russia?",
      "\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to ask Russia,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHaving listened to Trump talk about Putin for almost a decade now, this is the most critical stuff he\u2019s ever said,\u201d Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, said in an interview.",
      "The Russian embassy did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Ways to pressure Putin",
      "Words alone won\u2019t compel Putin to give up the quest to subdue Ukraine, national security experts said. For that to happen, Trump will need to demonstrate to Putin that it\u2019s fruitless to continue fighting, they said.",
      "That will take some doing. Putin remains uninterested in peace talks as long as Russian troops continue to gain ground in Ukraine\u2019s east, albeit at a slow pace, and while Ukrainian forces hold seized territory in the Kursk region inside Russia, according to John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and other former officials.",
      "\u201cHe [Putin] doesn\u2019t want to negotiate now, because his troops are moving forward,\u201d Herbst said. \u201cHe wants to put more Ukrainian territory in his pocket when negotiations begin.\u201d",
      "Sergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, told NBC News in an interview that \u201cUkraine is open for negotiation, but it should be a negotiation. Not an ultimatum by Russia. In this case, Ukraine demonstrated a will to negotiate. Russia does not.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how far Trump will go in confronting Russia over Ukraine and whether he would be ready to ratchet up military assistance \u2014 including long-range missiles \u2014 to Kyiv.",
      "Trump has at his disposal a variety of tools that might make Putin more inclined to stop fighting. The question is, will he use them?",
      "The Trump administration briefly delayed the shipment of weapons to Ukraine last week but it was unclear exactly why, according to\u00a0a source with knowledge of the matter.\u00a0The shipments have since resumed.",
      "Depriving Ukraine of weapons would be a severe blow to Kyiv\u2019s war effort against its much larger neighbor.",
      "Asked about the pause, the White House\u2019s National Security Council pointed to Trump\u2019s comments about Ukraine during an Oval Office appearance on Monday.",
      "There, Trump told reporters that he would be open to linking financial assistance to something the U.S. wants in return: Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey [the Ukrainians] have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it.\"",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the White House\u2019s National Security Council, said in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump shared yesterday, the United States needs to recoup any money it spends or has spent on Ukraine aid. The discussions over the weekend centered around how best to ensure that repayment, and a timetable has yet to be established.\u201d",
      "Split in the Trump administration",
      "Trump\u2019s advisers and Cabinet members are split over how much pressure to bring to bear, with national security adviser Mike Waltz and Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg wanting to use American leverage to prod Putin to stand down, according to former U.S. and Ukrainian officials and a source close to the Kyiv government.",
      "Others favor cutting back the billions of dollars in assistance the U.S. gave to Ukraine in the Biden administration as a way of forcing a swift end to the conflict. Critics of that approach say it would effectively disarm Ukraine and thus amount to a capitulation to Russia.",

      "\u201cWhy are spending $130 billion on Ukraine when we can\u2019t even pay our own bills at home?\u201d Vance said in one speech. He also called Ukraine\u2019s government \u201cthe most corrupt\u201d in Europe and possibly the world.",

      "Trump has laid out a few ideas for assisting Ukraine while the war continues.",
      "In a social media post two days after his swearing-in, he warned that he would slap Russia with tariffs, sanctions and taxes on the sale of Russian goods to the U.S. and other countries if Putin didn\u2019t negotiate an end to the war.",
      "A problem with that approach is that U.S. trade with Russia has fallen sharply, making tariffs less of a cudgel. Last year, the U.S. imported about $2.9 billion worth of goods from Russia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By contrast, in 2021, before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the figure was nearly $30 billion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total red herring,\u201d a former Biden administration national security official said of Trump\u2019s tariff threat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve totally disconnected the U.S. economy from the Russian economy,\u201d the former official added, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. \u201cSo, our ability to hurt Russia with tariffs is marginal.\u201d",
      "Another option would be for Trump to use Russia\u2019s own frozen assets, as opposed to U.S. tax dollars, to continue replenishing Ukraine supplies and weaponry.",
      "William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said that the $300 billion in Russian reserves sitting in European and U.S. banks \u201cwould go a long way to provide weapons and financial support to Ukraine.\u201d",

      "\u201cPresident Trump knows that the Russian economy is fragile and vulnerable to further sanctions. And thus, he knows that he has leverage on Putin,\u201d he added.",
      "A fear among Ukraine\u2019s supporters was that Trump would abandon the country upon returning to office. The warmth he had shown Putin over the years suggested he might bring about a settlement favorable to Russia, they worried.",
      "During a debate between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris last year, Trump did not say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.",

      "\u201cOne reason Trump\u2019s rhetoric has evolved is the switch from campaign to governing mode. The obstacle to peace is not Ukraine. I think that\u2019s sort of dawning on him, and it\u2019s also dawning on him how bad it would be politically, if nothing else, and strategically, if this f----- up.\u201d"

      "Medical evacuations were rare even before the Rafah crossing closed. From October 2023 to May, the United States, hospitals, various nongovernmental organizations and local officials in Gaza were able to quietly move just 150 patients, most of them children, out of Gaza for lifesaving care.",
      "After the Rafah crossing shut down when Israeli forces captured it in May, the improbable became nearly impossible.",

      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",
      "She felt newly hopeful in November 2020, when Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy was elected to a second consecutive term in a landslide. The military coup took place within three months, shattering Maung\u2019s dreams.",
      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ll own it,\u201d he said. Asked who would live in the territory he envisioned as the \u201criviera of the Middle East\u201d Trump, a longtime real estate developer, answered: \u201cThe world\u2019s people.\u201d",
      "Palestinians would also live there among \u201cmany\u201d others, he said in comments that stood in stark contrast to those he made earlier in the day when he  repeatedly called Gaza a \u201cdemolition site\u201d from which Palestinians should be relocated.",
      "The plan has been criticized for ignoring the Palestinian cause at its most basic \u2014 the creation of an internationally recognized state. The United States, the Palestinians and the international community have long considered the Gaza Strip to be an integral part of this future state, although negotiations have languished for decades.",
      "For some, Trump\u2019s proposal will also be a reminder of the \u201cNakba\u201d \u2014 the Arabic word for \u201ccatastrophe\u201d used to describe the 1948 displacement of some 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes during the founding of Israel.",
      "And Palestinian politicians of all persuasions were united in their condemnation of the comments.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iran\u2019s government seems to be welcoming some recent decisions by the United States \u2014 even though they happen to come from a man Iranian operatives have allegedly been plotting to assassinate.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s moves to freeze spending on foreign aid and overhaul, maybe even end, the U.S. Agency for International Development have been lauded in Iranian state media.",
      "The reports say the decisions will halt funding for opponents of the country\u2019s Shiite theocracy \u2014 pro-democracy activists and others supported through programs as part of U.S. government efforts to help democracy worldwide.",
      "At the same time, Iranian officials appear to be signaling that they are waiting for a message from Trump on whether he wants to negotiate over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program. At stake are potentially billions of dollars withheld from Iran through crushing sanctions and the future of a program on the precipice of enriching weapons-grade uranium.",
      "And even when signing an executive order to reimpose his \u201cmaximum pressure on Iran\u201d on Tuesday, Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran.",
      "Meanwhile, ordinary Iranians worry what all this could mean for them. On Wednesday, Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, plunged to a record low of 850,000 to $1 after Trump\u2019s order, showing the ongoing economic volatility they face. A decade ago, it stood at 32,000 rials to $1.",
      "\u201cIt encourages hard-liners inside Iran to continue repressions because they feel the U.S. would have less capability in supporting Iranian people who seek freedom,\u201d said Maryam Faraji, a 27-year-old waitress in a coffee shop in northern Tehran.",
      "The state-run IRNA news agency said that \u201ccutting the budget of foreign-based opposition\u201d could \u201caffect the sphere of relations\u201d between Tehran and Washington.",
      "Newspapers, like the conservative Hamshhari daily, described Iran\u2019s opposition as \u201ccounterrevolutionaries\u201d who had been \u201ccelebrating\u201d Trump\u2019s election as heralding the \u201clast days of life of the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "They then \u201csuddenly faced the surprise of cut funding from their employer,\u201d the newspaper crowed.",
      "Even the reformist newspaper Hammihan compared it to a \u201ccold shower\u201d for opponents of Iran\u2019s theocracy abroad, an idea also expressed by the Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cThose financial resources are not charity donations,\u201d Esmail Bagahei, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. \u201cThey are wages paid in exchange for services.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a clear sign of America\u2019s interventionist policy particularly during the Biden administration, which tried to pressure Iran and meddle in its domestic affairs through financial aid,\u201d Bagahei added.",
      "It remains unclear how funding for Iranian activists and opposition figures would be affected by the USAID decision.",
      "Iran also noticed that the U.S. avoided direct criticism of the Islamic Republic during a review by the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva last week. For those in Iran\u2019s government, there\u2019s anticipation this could mean that Trump is willing to negotiate, something he repeatedly brought up in his election campaign as a possibility.",
      "Even Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in September opened the door to talks with the U.S., saying there is \u201cno harm\u201d in engaging with the \u201cenemy.\u201d More recently, he tempered that, warning that sinister plots could still be \u201cconcealed behind diplomatic smiles.\u201d",
      "While Bagahei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged Iran hasn\u2019t seen any \u201cgreen light\u201d yet for talks, Iran is trying to do everything it can to signal it wants them.",
      "The country\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on outreach to the West, urged officials on Monday to listen to dissent from the Iranian people and avoid further crackdowns like those that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cThe enemies are hoping that by stirring up disputes within the country, they will throw people into the streets and then ride the wave of protests themselves,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "As he signed the executive order on Iran on Tuesday, Trump warned the country would be \u201cobliterated\u201d if he was assassinated by Tehran. But he still left the door open for talks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to sign it, but hopefully we\u2019re not going to have to use it very much,\u201d he said from the Oval Office. \u201cWe will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.\u201d",
      "However, factions within Iran\u2019s theocracy are still likely to oppose talks, whether out of their own self-interest or over anger that Trump ordered the 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the country\u2019s top general and a revered figure.",
      "That killing fueled Iranian calls for Trump\u2019s assassination \u2014 and alleged plots against him. In November, the Justice Department disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump. While Iran denied being involved, Tehran has a history of plotting the killing of opponents abroad.",
      "\u201cThis will not have any impact on the factions that oppose talks with the U.S., but maybe some moderates find it as an excuse to say that Trump is taking some steps,\u201d Iranian political analyst Ahmad Zeiabadi said."

      "The bill is aimed at protecting \u201cGreenland\u2019s political integrity\u201d and will take effect immediately, according to a translation of a parliamentary document in Danish outlining the measure.",
      "The bill \u201cmust be seen in light of the geopolitical interests in Greenland and the current situation where representatives of an allied great power have expressed interest in taking over and controlling Greenland,\u201d the document said.",
      "Before taking office for his second term on Jan. 20, Trump said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, calling it vital to U.S. national security. His oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited Greenland last month and told citizens: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat you well.\u201d",

      "Fridberg noted that some Russian politicians had voiced a similar interest \u2014 and that political parties in Greenland are generally funded by public means.",
      "The new measure also prohibits any single party from receiving domestic private contributions that exceed 200,000 Danish kroner (about $27,700) in total, or 20,000 kroner (about $2,770) from a single contributor."

But Marocco\u2019s review could lead to the \u201csuspension or elimination of programs, projects or activities; closing or suspending missions or post; closing, reorganizing, downsizing, or renaming establishments, organizations, bureaus, centers, or offices; reducing the size of the workforce at such entities and contracting out or privatizing functions or activities performed by federal employees,\u201d Rubio added.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Rubio said: \u201cThis is not about getting rid of foreign aid.\u00a0 There are things that we do through USAID that we should continue to do, that makes sense.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have to decide is that better through the State Department, or is that better through something, a reformed USAID?\u201d",
      "But the freeze on funding was already \u201chaving a direct effect on people whose lives are already vulnerable,\u201d Peter Taylor, director of the Institute of Development Studies, said in a telephone interview Thursday. In one case a workshop on sanitation programming was immediately halted, he added.",
      "A review by the Congressional Research Service last month found that USAID provided assistance to around 130 countries with Jordan, Syria, Ethiopia and South Sudan among the top 10 recipients. But top of the list was Ukraine which has been at war with Russia for almost three years, since President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of the country.",
      "It has also provided millions of dollars in military aid to Israel, while providing humanitarian help to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.",
      "Despite the freeze on funding, NBC News reported last month that Rubio issued a waiver for foreign military financing for both Israel and Egypt. A waiver was also approved for \u201cemergency food assistance and administrative expenses, including salaries, necessary to administer such assistance.\u201d",
      "In Fiscal Year 2023, the U.S. dedicated more than $44.6 billion on international development worldwide, according to USAID. But that represents less than 1% of its budget for foreign assistance, a smaller overall share than some other countries.",
      "\u2018America\u2019s enemies will rejoice\u2019",
      "Founded as an independent agency in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID was designed to counter the influence of the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War and to run various foreign assistance programs, based on the idea that American security was tied to stability and economic advancements in other nations.",
      "Since then, foreign aid has been widely viewed as a cornerstone of soft power, a term popularized in the 1980s by U.S. political scientist Joseph Nye to describe the ability to influence others to deliver desired outcomes.",
      "Nye said that he thought Trump lacked \u201can understanding of soft power.\"",
      "\u201cPower is the ability to get others to do what you want and you can do it three ways: you can do it with coercion; you do it with payment; you do it with attraction, which is famous \u2014 sticks and carrots and honey \u2014 and Trump doesn\u2019t understand honey,\u201d he told NBC News in a telephone interview on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an unfortunate moment,\u201d he said of the sweeping changes and uncertainty around U.S. foreign aid. \u201cBased on a misunderstanding of all the elements of power.\u201d",
      "The decision to suspend assistance without any warning will already \u201chave a significant impact,\u201d Ingram said, adding it would \u201cdo serious damage to the trust that the U.S. has built up over the years in many countries carrying out a foreign aid program that is dependable and is seen as working in the interests of those countries.\u201d",
      "Michael Schiffer, who served as the assistant administrator of the USAID Bureau for Asia from 2022 until January, was more blunt in his assessment in an opinion piece published on the online forum Just Security.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration has just put America last, while handing a gift to our biggest adversaries, notably China,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAmerica\u2019s alliances will suffer. U.S. partners will be at risk. And America\u2019s enemies will rejoice,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. national security could \u201cerode,\u201d with abrupt changes to development programs risking instability in countries around the world, potentially influencing extremism and deepening migration crises, he added.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s allies have offered similar warnings.",
      "During the Senate Budget Committee confirmation hearing for\u00a0 Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s pick for budget chief, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. warned last month of the importance of soft power as a \u201ccritical component of defending America and our values.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get involved in the world and you don\u2019t have programs in Africa where China\u2019s trying to buy the whole continent, we\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concept of soft power means a lot to me \u2014 and that\u2019s coming from a pretty hawkish guy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump, speaking at a White House news conference Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, announced that the U.S. would seek ownership of the war-torn Gaza Strip after saying Palestinians have no choice but to leave their homes there.",
      "\"We'll own it,\" Trump said of Gaza. \"We're going to take over that piece, develop it and create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something the entire Middle East can be proud of,\" he said, adding that a \u201clong-term ownership position\u201d by the U.S. would bring \u201cgreat stability to the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Asked who would live there, Trump said, \u201cI envision the world people living there, the world\u2019s people. You\u2019ll make that into an international unbelievable place. I think the potential in the Gaza strip is unbelievable,\u201d and it could be \u201cthe riviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "\u201cPalestinians will live there. Many people will live there,\u201d he added.",
      "The president did not answer questions about the legality of essentially taking over a sovereign territory.",
      "Netanyahu said one of his goals is to make sure Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again, and that \u201cTrump sees a different future for that piece of land.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about it,\u201d Netanyahu said of Trump\u2019s Gaza Strip suggestion.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s something that could change history and it worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\u201d",
      "During Netanyahu's visit, Trump repeatedly called Gaza a \"demolition site\" and said that the Palestinians who are living there should be relocated, claiming they would be \u201cthrilled\u201d to live elsewhere and are only staying because they have \"no alternative.\"",
      "\"The whole thing is a mess,\" Trump said of Gaza, which has been devastated by the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "\"I don't think people should be going back to Gaza. I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They've lived like hell; they've lived like you're living in hell. Gaza is not a place for people to be living. The only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is they have no alternative. What's the alternative? Go where? If they had an alternative, they'd much rather not go back to Gaza and live in a beautiful alternative that's safe,\" he said.",
      "Trump said the approximately 1.8 million Palestinians should be moved to a new site or sites in other Arab countries, such as Egypt or Jordan, where they can \"live in peace.\"",
      "\"They say they\u2019re not going to accept\" them, Trump said of Egypt and Jordan. \"I say they will, but I think other countries will accept also.\"",
      "Trump said that Palestinians going to a new land \"would be a lot better than going back to Gaza, which has had decades and decades of death.\"",
      "\"They'll be resettled in areas where they can live a beautiful life,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether that would mean forcibly displacing people, Trump said, \"I don't think so.\"",
      "A spokesman for Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, blasted Trump\u2019s remarks, saying, \u201cWe consider it a recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur people in the Gaza Strip will not allow these plans to pass, and what is required is to end the occupation and aggression against our people, not expel them from their land,\u201d he said.",
      "The meeting with Netanyahu was Trump's first with a foreign leader since the start of his second term.",
      "Trump previewed the discussion at the White House as a \"very big meeting\" when he was speaking to reporters Sunday. In his letter inviting Netanyahu to Washington last week, he wrote, \u201cI look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday that they would discuss \"the critical issues that lie ahead of us \u2014 defeating Hamas, returning all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian axis in all its components, an axis that also threatens Israel\u2019s security, the Middle East and the entire world.\"",
      "Trump's transition team helped the Biden administration secure a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas. The next phase of the agreement was expected to be one of the topics discussed Tuesday.",
      "The conflict\u00a0began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Israel retaliated with an air and land assault on Gaza,\u00a0killing more than 47,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced.",
      "The scale of Israeli counteroffensive has led to international condemnation, but Netanyahu has defended his actions, most recently en route to Washington.",
      "\"The decisions we have made during the war, combined with the heroism of the IDF soldiers, they have already changed the face of the Middle East. They have changed it beyond recognition. I think that by working hard with President Trump, we can change it even more, for the better,\" he said.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump had said he wants Jordan and Egypt to accept more Palestinian refugees as part of an effort to\u00a0\u201cclean out\u201d Gaza.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of Tuesday's bilateral meeting, Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, said Trump was referring to making the area \"habitable.\" He also said the five-year timeline to rebuild Gaza in a future phase of the ceasefire deal was unrealistic and \"preposterous.\" National security adviser Mike Waltz said rebuilding would be likely to take up to 15 years.",
      "Witkoff said: \"There\u2019s 30,000 unexploded munitions in Gaza. It is the buildings that could tip over at any moment. There\u2019s no utilities there whatsoever, no, no working water, electric, gas, nothing. God knows what kind of disease might be festering there.\"",
      "Netanyahu and Trump were close allies during Trump's first term, but their relationship became strained after Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election while Trump was still challenging the results.",
      "Just days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally that Netanyahu had \u201clet us down\u201d during his first administration, arguing that he had been unhelpful before\u00a0the United States killed a top Iranian general. That led to criticism from his Republican rivals, and Trump later posted on social media, \u201c#IStandWithIsrael\u201d and \u201c#IStandWithBibi,\u201d using Netanyahu's nickname.",
      "Their relationship appeared mended in July when Netanyahu visited Trump at his Florida residence after having met with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and after a failed attempt on Trump's life.",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday that the \"fact that this will be [Trump's] first meeting with a foreign leader since his inauguration has great significance for the state of Israel\" and \"testifies to the strength of the alliance between Israel and the United States.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday how his relationship is with Netanyahu now after the ups and downs, Trump said, \"Mostly ups.\"",
      "The trip is far from Netanyahu's first trip to the White House.",
      "When he was welcomed Monday at Blair House, the historic official guest residence of the White House, its director said it was Netanyahu's 14th visit to the residence \u2014 many more than any other foreign leader has made since it was built in the 19th century."

      "\"That\u2019s an offer President Bukele made. Obviously, we\u2019ll have to study it on our end,\" Rubio said Tuesday afternoon while speaking to reporters in Costa Rica, the third stop of his first foreign trip as secretary of state. \"There are obviously legalities involved. We have a Constitution, we have all sorts of things, but it\u2019s a very generous offer.\"",
      "The administration of President Donald Trump has not yet made a decision on the offer, Rubio said.",
      "Three legal and immigration experts who spoke with NBC News  raised questions about the legality of such actions and anticipated significant legal pushback on any effort to deport incarcerated U.S. nationals to another country.",
      "\"The U.S. can't deport one of its own citizens. Deportation is for noncitizens only,\" said Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School.",

      "'An extraordinary gesture'",
      "In an post on X, Rubio described Bukele's offer as \"an\u00a0extraordinary gesture never before extended by any country.\"",
      "\"Very productive meeting with Salvadoran President @nayibbukele,\" the post reads. \"His commitment to accept and incarcerate criminals from any country, including from violent gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, will make America safer.\"",
      "Fordham's Gordon said, \u201cCan the U.S. deport Salvadorans convicted of crimes to El Salvador? Yes. Can El Salvador keep those people in its own prisons? Yes. But as to U.S. citizens, it\u2019s not an immigration question. It\u2019s a prison policy question.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Prisons for comment, but did not get an immediate response.",
      "In another post on X, Bukele clarified that El Salvador is \"willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee.\"",
      "\"We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,\" Bukele's post reads. \"The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "The Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, as Bukele referred to it, is a Salvadoran prison built to house 40,000 people. Instances of extreme overcrowding and torture by guards have been documented at this prison by human rights organizations such as the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.",
      "Bukele's office did not respond to an NBC News request seeking comment and further details on the offer.",
      "After meeting with Bukele on Monday, Rubio said he briefed Trump on this offer, along a couple other ones.",
      "According to Rubio's office, Bukele also agreed to continue accepting Salvadoran nationals deported from the U.S., which El Salvador is already doing.",
      "Bukele also offered to accept foreign nationals from other countries who are arrested in the U.S. for violating U.S. immigration laws.",
      "El Salvador had previously signed\u00a0an agreement in 2019, known as a \u201csafe third country\u201d deal, to receive non-Salvadorans detained in the U.S. \u2014 but it was never implemented because of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said that noncitizens and people who have been granted protections preventing the U.S. from deporting them to a country where they may face persecution or torture \"could be sent to a third country as long as that's not the country where they would face persecution or torture.\"",
      "But as the Trump administration implements policies allowing officials to bypass regular immigration law and speed up deportations of anyone with a removal order, it may become harder for noncitizens to challenge their deportations, even if they're sent to a country where they're not from, Bush-Joseph added.",
      "Gordon said she would anticipate constitutional and due process challenges if there are attempts to deport U.S. citizens."
